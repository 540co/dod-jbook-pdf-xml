            "val": "Utility Helicopter Mods include modifications to the UH-60 Black Hawk and the UH-72A Lakota helicopters. The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter is the Army's utility helicopter in the future force. It is a twin engine, single rotor, four bladed utility helicopter used for air assault, general support, command & control, and aero-medical evacuations (MEDEVAC).  The UH-60 is joint force capable, providing 24 hour\/day support including operations at night and in adverse weather conditions. The UH-60 is designed to carry a crew of four plus eleven combat equipped troops or an external load up to 9,000 pounds. The UH-60 Black Hawk was fielded in 1978 as a replacement for the UH-1.  From 1978 to 1988, UH-60As were produced.  In 1989 production of UH-60Ls with improved engines and drive train began. In 2007, full rate production of UH-60Ms began which provided a digital cockpit, digital Flight Management System (FMS), improved engine, and wide-cord main rotor blades. The UH-72A Lakota helicopter provides general aviation support for aviation units in the active and reserve components."

            "val": "FY18 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.900 million will procure Enhanced Ballistics Armor Protection Systems (EBAPS). EBAPS provides ballistic protection to the UH-60 fielded fleet through the use of ballistic blankets or other similar protective device.  Because of low altitude and low airspeed tactical flight profiles, Black Hawk helicopters, crews, passengers, and cargo are susceptible to damage and injuries from small arms fire.  A mission flexible ballistic protection system is needed to protect crews, passengers, cargo, and critical aircraft components from small arms damage. The UH-60 A to L Conversion program expands the current UH-60 A to A recapitalization\/rebuild.  Effective in FY16 all A to L conversions and UH-60L Digital, now designated as UH-60V, conversions will be procured under line A05009.  Prior to FY16 the funding for UH-60 A to L conversions was conducted under this line AA0492.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

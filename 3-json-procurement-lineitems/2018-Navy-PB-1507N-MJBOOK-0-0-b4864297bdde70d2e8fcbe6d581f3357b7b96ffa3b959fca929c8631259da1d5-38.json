            "val": "Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) Equipment is currently used by MH-53E helicopters to counter the threat of sea mines.  The MH-60S helicopter will be adapted for the AMCM mission in support of the development of an Organic Fleet AMCM program.  The equipment is divided into three categories -- minesweeping, minehunting, and mine neutralization.  (1) Minesweeping is performed by mechanical or influence sweeps. In mechanical sweeping, the mine mooring is severed by the sweep gear allowing the mine to float to the surface where it is destroyed. In influence sweeping, a magnetic or acoustic field, which simulates the magnetic\/acoustic signature of a ship, is introduced into the water.  This field causes the mine mechanism to actuate.  (2) In mine hunting, the objective is to locate, identify, and classify mine like objects (usually by means of high resolution sonar). (3) Finally, in mine neutralization, previously identified\/classified mine like objects are reacquired and neutralized using explosive devices.\n\n[P5 \/ ARCHERFISH Neutralizer]: AN\/ASQ-235 - Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAMNS will provide the MH-60S helicopter with the capability to neutralize bottom and moored mines using an expendable mine neutralization device.  The AMNS was tested on the MH-53E helicopter to prove the neutralization effectiveness.  The system will be deployed from the MH-60S helicopter as part of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Mission Package.  This capability will be of critical importance in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points, and the Amphibious Objective Area (AOA).  AMNS procurements are funded with OPN for the AMNS combat system and WPN for the AMNS Archerfish neutralizer.\n\n[P5 - 2 \/ SEAFOX Neutralizer]: SEAFOX neutralizers are used from the AN\/ASQ-232, Airborne Mine Neutralization System - SEAFOX (AMNS-SF), the AN\/SLQ-60, Surface Mine Neutralization System - SEAFOX (SMNS-SF), and the SEAFOX Portable Mine Neutralization System (PMNS).  Airborne combat systems are deployed from the MH-53E SEA DRAGON helicopters.  Surface combat systems are deployed from the MCM-1 Avenger Class ships.  The portable (PMNS) combat system is deployed from a Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB)."

            "val": "FY 2018 funding supports the baseline program to procure the neutralization capability for our current in service mission (SEAFOX - MH-53E helicopters and MCM Class Ships). FY 2018 also procures the neutralization capability for our organic mission (Archerfish MH-60S and LCS). This capability is currently deployed around the world to meet the current operational mine warfare mission demand for these systems."

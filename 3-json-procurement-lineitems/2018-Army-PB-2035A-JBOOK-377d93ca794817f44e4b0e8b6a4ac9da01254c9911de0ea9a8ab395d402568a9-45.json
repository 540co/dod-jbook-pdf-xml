            "val": "The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) system provides the Army's only in-theater capability for directly downloading raw infrared data from the Defense Support Program satellites, processing this data into ballistic missile early warnings, alerting, cueing, and disseminating that information reliably to theater combatant commanders. JTAGS Block I, fielded since 1997, currently has five ground stations (four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning and the fifth CONUS system serves as a training system and a spare deployable asset). JTAGS systems are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, EUCOM, and CENTCOM). Obsolescence\/Information Assurance issues coupled with the desire to take advantage of the Air Force's investment in newer satellites (Space Based Infrared System, SBIR) and their improved sensor\u2019s warning accuracy and timeliness, led to the Army's approval\/initiation of a two phase JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) Block II program. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 includes de-sheltering the system and upgrading hardware\/software to address obsolescence\/ Information Assurance issues. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. These capabilities are primarily software improvements designed to take full advantage of new sensors on orbit. FY 2017 funds completes procurement of JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 upgrades.  Prior years funding began the procurement of the JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 upgrades.  Two (2) of Five (5) Block II Phase I upgrades were procured with FY 2014 procurement dollars.  FY 2019 funds will procure JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 2 software upgrades for the program\u2019s five systems.  \n\nApproved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is five systems."

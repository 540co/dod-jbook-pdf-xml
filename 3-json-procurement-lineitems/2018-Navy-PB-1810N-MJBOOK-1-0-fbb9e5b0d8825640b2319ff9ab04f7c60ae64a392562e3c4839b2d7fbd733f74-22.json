            "val": "NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (NAVSTAR GPS) provides assured and protected navigation solutions to Warfighters through supported, affordable, and integrated systems, and is the primary source of positioning, navigation and timing information for the DoD.\n\n[P3A \/ (1R0013) Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)]: NAVWAR ensures that U. S. military forces maintain access to the GPS in an electronically challenging battle space, delivers the capability to deny adversaries access to and use of GPS during military operations, and serves to preserve the peaceful use of GPS.  Navy GPS Enhanced User Equipment (UE) Operational Requirements Document  directs that future UE will incorporate an increased anti-jam capability.  NAVWAR counters the threat by increasing resistance to intentional or unintentional interference.  Sea NAVWAR Strategy comprises of 2 program increments, the first increment (near term) is to install GPS anti-jam antenna system (GAS-1) on surface platforms.  The second increment (long term) is to install Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) antennas on surface platforms.  The ADAP antenna improves upon GAS-1 performance by providing simultaneous dual frequency nulling, and built in test ability. Procurement and installation of anti-jam GPS antennas and modernized user equipment is required to ensure the continuation of GPS signals from space in a hostile jamming environment.  The Sea NAVWAR program will equip selected ships with anti-jam GPS antennas to ensure the continued availability of GPS to support surface combat operations and provide reliable GPS and other positioning, navigation and timing data to ship-board Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance(C4ISR), Combat, and Weapons Systems.\n\n[P3A - 2 \/ (1R019) Global Positioning System (GPS) - based positioning, Navigation, & Timing Service (GPNTS)]: The GPS-based PNT Service (GPNTS) system is the primary PNT system for the Navy to ensure reliable PNT capability and interoperability insertion in GPS receivers and associated Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) and combat systems in a denied environment. GPNTS provides precise PNT data required for combat, weapons, command, control, communications, navigation, and other systems, as well as providing the time synchronization critical to the network environments. GPNTS backfits current PNT\/GPS systems and forward fit new platforms. GPNTS will host the Air Force GPS Directorate-developed Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) card, allowing access to the new more accurate and secure GPS Military-Code (M-Code) signal. GPNTS provides more robust and secure GPS\/PNT capabilities than is currently in the Fleet.  The system provides the capability to migrate non-real time GPS data toward a Common Computing Environment (CCE) and provide a path for the integration of advanced navigation systems and sensors."

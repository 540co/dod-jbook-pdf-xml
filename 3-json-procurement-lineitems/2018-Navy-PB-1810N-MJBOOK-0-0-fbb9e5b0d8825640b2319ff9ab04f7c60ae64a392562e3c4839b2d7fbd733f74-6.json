            "val": "Note: Submarine Electromagnetic Systems including Imaging, Electronic Warfare and Radar programs are managed by PMS435. Imaging Budget Line Item 0831 and Electronic Warfare Budget Line Item 2560 (including Radar) OPN funds will consolidate under BLI 0840 in FY17 and out.\n\nThe Submarine Periscopes and Imaging Equipment Program procures the Type 18 and Type 8 periscope upgrades; all variants of Photonics Mast (PM), including Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM) and 360 degree imaging capability and incorporates it in the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS), and VIRGINIA Class imaging upgrades and Photonics land based spares. Commander Naval Submarine Force (CNSF), Operations Review Group (ORG) selected the Periscope Acquisition, Tracking, and Ranging with Improved Observation Techniques (PATRIOT) Type 18 Periscope Rangefinder and the Night Owl Type 8 Infra-Red (IR) Periscope as high priority tactical control technologies to field. By OPNAV Ltr Ser. N77\/3U629209, 12 June 2003, OPNAV N87 established the ISIS to rapidly field these systems and integrate existing periscope imagery systems into a single system for installation on board submarines. An ISIS capability development document (CDD) was approved 22 Dec, 2011. The CDD is used to fully integrate the ISIS program of record into the submarine force's rapid insertion technology process and to incorporate Fleet-endorsed requirements such as LPPM that are not levied by the ISIS Operational Requirements Documents. ISIS supports high intensity operations in the littorals, providing the submarine force with the tactical imaging systems necessary to safely and effectively employ its surveillance and weapons capabilities. The IR imaging capability improves imaging at night and in low visibility conditions. The PATRIOT Automated Range Finder provides a 360 degree search independent of the visual search, enhanced situational awareness and provides a collision avoidance capability. Tactical Imagery Technology Insertion (TI) includes the common control and displays hardware and software on all platforms regardless of imaging sensors, an integrated imaging system that provides for operator alerts, imaging enhancement tools and contact analysis tools, and a fully Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) integrated system providing \"any display anywhere.\" Funding improves submarine imaging capability in the areas of: ship safety, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), tactical control (contact management in the littorals) to provide high quality imaging 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in all weather conditions to support submarine operations worldwide. ISIS provides for the modernization of imaging systems to improve imaging capabilities for the submarine force in support of ISR requirements. This includes the integration of new capabilities, both inboard hardware and software, into the Type 18 and Type 8 Periscopes for LOS ANGELES Class and SEAWOLF Class submarines, the Photonics Mast Variant (PMV) for SSGN, and Photonics Mast upgrades to the VIRGINIA Class AN\/BVS-1 including the AN\/BVY-1 ISIS capability and LPPM.\n\nPL010 - Imaging ISIS Technical Insertions - Continuing in FY17 funding procures Imaging systems and Technical Insertion kits and spares to upgrade ISIS systems on LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, VA and OHIO Class SSGN platforms to allow for Capability Insertion and obsolescence avoidance. FY16 procurement also adds funding for improved copper-fiber optic diploops and hull penetrators required to support advanced Imaging and Early Warning capabilities included in Low Profile Photonics Mast and future 360 degree Imaging masts.\n\nPL011 - Imaging Block Upgrades - FY17 funding continues procurement of Periscopes and Imaging Equipment reliability, capability, and maintainability upgrades, e.g., Eyepiece Box, periscope mechanical hoisting mechanism upgrades, inboard electronic processing hardware and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Robust Surveillance Program, Certification of regional repair centers for Imaging System maintenance and technical data. Variable quantities and types are bought in each fiscal year.\n\nPL012 - Funds procure replacement in support of Special Support Equipment (SSE) for each maintenance level to ensure systems are maintained in a state of operational readiness. Equipment includes Q-Band Test Equipment, Mast Dynamic Collimator, Eyebox\/Mast Test Set, and Antenna\/Outer Head Simulator required due to obsolescence and age of existing imaging systems SSE.\n\nPL015 - Funding is for Interim Contract Support provided by the periscope manufacturer. The majority of the funding is for Type18 service life extension, depot repair and upgrades for all configurations of Photonics Masts. It also funds all levels of repairs for all types of tactical submarine imaging systems.\n\nPL016 - Funding is for imaging systems training requirements to include curriculum development, training materials, and initial factory training pilot course conduct, Navy Training Plans, and instructor advisory services.\n\nPL022 - Funding is for the procurement of SSN ISIS Imaging Systems. ISIS provides for the modernization of imaging systems to improve imaging capabilities for the submarine force in support of ISR requirements. This includes the integration of the Type 18 PATRIOT Automated Range Finder and Type 8 IR Periscope as well as other new capabilities into the Type 18 and Type 8 Periscopes.\n\nPL023 - Funding is for the procurement and support of VIRGINIA Class ISIS Imaging Systems, as well as, Technical Insertions required for sustainment of VIRGINIA Class platforms, including the integration of the Mast Technical Insertions into the Photonics Mast. These systems support submarine force ISR requirements through the modernization of legacy hardware which allows for Capability Insertion, obsolescence avoidance, and improved system reliability.\n\nPL025 - Funding is for the procurement, support and technical insertion of VIRGINIA Class LPPM production and land based spare masts and associated components. The spares will be used for replacement Imaging Masts on VIRGINIA Class Submarines. Quantity of spares will increase with VIRGINIA submarine procurements.\n\nPL830 - Production Engineering funds provide the following functions: value engineering; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; production configuration control; maintenance engineering efforts\ndesigned and incorporated into the production manufacturing process, and other related engineering functions that are integral to all of the Imaging Systems and ancillary components.\n\nPL900 - Imaging Systems engineering, technical and maintenance services funds provide the following functions: In-Service engineering and technical support to deployed Periscope and Imaging Equipment, imaging system\ninstallation and integration planning, SHIPALT and TEMPALT technical data preparation, production hardware design review, engineering\/technical support for installations, training materials development, field engineering and\ntechnical problem resolution, block upgrade installation planning, configuration management, and maintenance planning including inventory, management, repair, and restoration scheduling.\n\nPL927 - Funding is for the installation of Fleet Modernization Program Equipment.\n\nPL4M7 - Funding is for the installation of non-Fleet Modernization Program Equipment."

            "val": "The increase in Systems Replacement and Modernization (SRAM) in FY 2021 funds fleet priorities for modernization efforts at Navy training ranges in support of fleet training wholeness.\n\nFunds in FY 2021 for Ocean Systems will continue the effort to replace the in-water sensor system and shore electronics at the Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range (BARSTUR) at Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), HI.  Existing BARSTUR instrumentation is past its 20 year service life, which has led to multiple cable failures and degraded range tracking and communication capability. BARSTUR effort includes replacement of failed Barking Sands Underwater Range Expansion (BSURE) high frequency projector capability required for BSURE range safety.  The BARSTUR effort will be a time-phased procurement exception to the full funding policy.  Hardware buys will vary in cost from year to year to meet the Fleet's required date for Full Operational Capability (FOC).  FY 2021 also funds a second complete Portable Undersea Training Range (PUTR) system.\n\nThe increase in FY 2021 for Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) Increment II funds the procurement of six Ground Subsystems (GS) and five Remote Range Units (RRU) to provide encryption capability for Fleet training exercises.  TCTS Inc II achieves MS-C in FY 2021 and converts from RDTEN 0204571N PU 3093 to OPN Line Item 4204 \/ Weapons Range Support Equipment & APN Line Item 0725 \/ Other Production Charges.\n\nElectronic Warfare (EW) Threat Presentation fluctuates in funding from year to year reflect Navy prioritization of various Electronic Warfare (EW) Threat Presentation devices for use at multiple Tactical Training Range (TTR) sites, including Fallon, NV; Yuma, AZ; Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE), CA; Mid-Atlantic Electronic Warfare Range (MAEWR), NC.  Funds in FY 2021 will procure additional Encrypted Range Radios and additional Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) modules for use at the East and West Coast Opposition Force (OPFOR) Training areas.\n\nFunds in FY 2021 for Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) will modify various East Coast Tactical Training Ranges (TTR) with voice communication and datalink equipment in support of LVC capabilities.  Install distributed network capabilities at various West Coast TTR's, according to Fleet priorities, in support of LVC capabilities."

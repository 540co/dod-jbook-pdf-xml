            "val": "1.  The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, safe, affordable systems to operational commanders.  The Aircraft Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness support 1) management and upkeep of government-owned industrial plants; 2) management of industrial base assessments; 3) environmental compliance and pollution prevention at government-owned industrial plants.\n\n2. Four basic activities are funded in this appropriation: Industrial Facilities (3000), Industrial Base Assessments (6000), Environmental Compliance (7000), and Pollution Prevention (6044).\n\nIndustrial Facility Capital Type Rehabilitation cost element (MPC 3000) provides for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment, real property directives (appraisals, easements, physical condition reports, etc.) and energy conservation to ensure government-owned, contractor-operated industrial facilities remain operationally safe, suitable and effective to meet the nation's weapon system industry needs.  These plants are the backbone of defense weapon system assembly and maintenance for the B-2, U-2, F-16, P-3 C-130, C-5B, RQ-4 Global Hawk, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter & classified programs and it is the intent of Congress (10USC 2535) to provide an essential nucleus of government owned industrial plants.\n\nIndustrial Base Assessment cost element (MPC 6000) provides for the identification, analysis and assessment of industrial base concerns dealing with aircraft research and development, production, and sustainment.  These assessments provide timely and accurate industrial base information to support Air Force decisions on 1) aircraft weapon system acquisition risks; 2) budget allocation investments; 3) weapon system sustainment and logistics support; and 4) defense industry mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.  Supports Joint & Service industrial base planning on shared commodities, technologies, and facilities.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance cost element (MPC 7000) provides for the efforts needed to maintain environmental compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding operation of the government-owned contractor-operated industrial facilities. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials.  Environmentally compliant industrial facilities enable production to continue and grow to meet our nation's weapon system needs and avoid the risk of cleanup costs and penalties from Federal, State and Local regulators.\n\nPollution Prevention (P2) cost element (MPC 6044) at AF government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities implements the Pollution Prevention program that reduces emissions to air, land, and water, reduces AF cost as facility owner.  Implements Environmental Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) risk management that reduces weapon systems' risk impacts and lifecycle costs.  Includes qualification of improved processes, materials and equipment; energy conservation initiatives; P2 opportunity assessments; and recovery\/recycling to minimize hazardous waste.  Program results can be shared to benefit others.  Activities support AF goals under P2 Act, EO 13834, Efficient Fed Ops, AF\/CV and SAF\/IE Policy on P2 and Waste Elimination, USD (AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Funding for P2 moved to PE 78011F in FY16.  Prior to FY15, funds provided through PE 078054F.  FY19 moved from BP19 to BP14.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

This includes capital type rehabilitation (MPC 3000) projects for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment, property appraisals and energy conservation; and environmental compliance (MPC 7000) efforts to ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials. Air Force Plant 44 is the backbone of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems assembly and maintenance supporting AMRAAM, Javelin, Griffin, Phalanx, Sidewinder, Standard Missiles, Stinger, Tomahawk, and numerous other weapon system.  Funds are also provided within this appropriation to assess space-related industrial base concerns (MPC 6000).  \n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

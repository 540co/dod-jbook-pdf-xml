FY2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The Budget requests these funds in OCO to  comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThis P-1 line funds spares and repair parts for Procurement of Ammunition, Air Force (PAAF) items.  Initial spares consist of reparable components, assemblies and subassemblies, as well as consumable items required in support of newly fielded end items.  Requirements are based on historical failure\/demand data on similar items.  Replenishment spares consist of reparable components, assemblies and subassemblies required for follow-on sustainment of end items.  Munitions replenishment spare levels are based on item-specific failure\/demand driven computations.\n\nProvide Area Attack telemetry kit WSEP analysis for Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD). Contractor will perform engineering study, installation, delivery and testing for WCMD weapons with telemetry kits.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve production DMS\/MS\/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier\/parts replacement, to include electronic components used commercially and in short supply, and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.\n\nPE associated with this P-1 Line is 0208030F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

Initial or Replenishment spares and repair parts are necessary for the following Air Force (PAAF) P-1 end items: Rockets, Cartridges, Practice Bombs, General Purpose Bombs, CAD\/PAD, Explosive Ordinance Disposal, Flares, and Fuzes.   \n\nThe Air Force procures munitions to maintain appropriate quantities in the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Munitions and test and training stockpiles. Active, Guard and Reserve components draw from the WRM stockpiles as required and receive test and training allocations annually based on current-year requirements."

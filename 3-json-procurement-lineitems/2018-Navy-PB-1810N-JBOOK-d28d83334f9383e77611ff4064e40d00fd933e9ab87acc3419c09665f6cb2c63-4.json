        "Description": {
            "val": "The FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $2.924 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program initiated in FY14 as a transfer of funding from BLI 5246, to allow the Navy to better align and identify Hull, Mechanical & Electrical (HM&E) requirements, shipboard upgrades and equipment in support of the in-service Surface Combatants to include Class Common Equipment to support shorter Regular Overhauls and Selected Restricted Availabilities, including Ship System Components that require long repair turn-around; CG\/DDG - Machinery Control Systems (MCS) COTS Refresh; Ship Control Systems and installation in support of the Ship Control System.\n\n[P40A \/ GB001 - CG\/DDG COTS Tech Refresh]: Due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment must be periodically refreshed to ensure supportability to the Fleet. This cost code is used to fund solutions for HM&E systems that have parts with oncoming DMSMS impacts. DMSMS solutions, including after-market manufacturing (reverse engineering), bridge-buys, life-of-type buys, modernization through replacement, modification \/ redesign, and reclamation are implemented to ensure that in-service ships are operational and sustainable throughout the life of the system. DMSMS issues and planned resolutions are implemented outside of standard CNO availabilities (WOO or CMAV) and are impacted by pending fact-of-life influences, including shifting availabilities, modified vendor End of Sale dates, and unforeseen material shortages.\n\n[P40A \/ GB002 - Class Common Equipment]: The CCE program is to provide Ready-For-Issue (RFI) systems and equipment in support of Surface Combatant ship industrial availabilities, and to replace major system equipment which sustains battle damage or major failure.  CCE Availability Assets (AAs) ensure warfighting capability, readiness, and on-time deployment by providing RFI long lead time material (LLTM) in case of possible catastrophic damage or major failure on Aegis ships. CCE AAs are procured and stored to support backfit upgrades and emergent maintenance within brief availability windows.  The ready accessibility of these assets avoids delays in availability completion caused by lengthy equipment repair turn-around time or acquisition lead time.  In addition to availability assets, the CCE program also provides for Insurance Assets.  These are the major long lead time HM&E equipment\/systems which, due to major damage or battle damage, would prevent a ship from being able to be quickly repaired in order to accomplish its mission.  The CCE program provides for both CG and DDG assets.\n\n[P40A \/ GB003 - Ship Control Systems (Installed under GB6IN)]: Funds provided support the procurement of Ship Control Systems (SCS) upgrades to be installed under GB6IN on both cruisers and destroyers in support of the Fleet Modernization Program. Ship Control Systems provide lifecycle support for legacy and modernized engineering controls. SCS equipment and components are procured for various ship changes and engineering change proposals for in-service surface combatants and are installed outside of standard CNO availabilities.  This effort includes maintaining Land Based Engineering Sites (LBES), CG \/ DDG system refresh, SCD design engineering, CG \/ DDG equipment procurement, and CG \/ DDG ISEA\/ILS support.  This cost code also provides for funding the necessary software licenses in support of the HM&E COTS systems\/equipment for both CG and DDG class ships.  Examples of systems requiring software licenses are: Machinery Control System components, Voyage Management System, Integrated Bridge System, Integrated Bridge and Navigation System, and Digital Video Surveillance System.\n\n[P40A \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Previously Procured in BLI 0110 and BLI 0120)]: Maritime Energy Initiatives provide surface combatants with technologies\/tools that reduce energy usage. This will enhance operational capabilities, allowing for longer time on-station and fewer refuelings. These initiatives will also help meet the CNO's 2020 goal of reducing the surface fleet's fuel usage by 15%. The initiatives consist of:  1) Hull and Hydrodynamics - These initiatives focus on the dynamic forces where the ship contacts the water. They include, but are not limited to hull appendages that reduce drag, thus improving speed and fuel efficiency; 2) Power Generation and Transmission Systems - These initiatives focus on, but are not limited to improving the efficiency of ships' prime movers, generators, main reduction gears, propulsion motors\/drives, and shaft-line components; 3) Combat and Ship Systems Support Services - These initiatives focus on, but are not limited to improving systems that use electricity when providing support services (e.g. cooling, heating, air, lube oil) to combat machinery, or life support systems; and 4) Decision Aids - These initiatives will inform the sailor of decisions they can make to save energy and improve operational efficiency by consolidating and manipulating ship data and providing it back as actionable information.\n\n[P40A \/ GB6IN - HM&E Installation (Procured under GB003)]: Funds provided support the installation of ship control systems upgrades (procured in GB003 CG\/DDG) on both cruisers and destroyers in support of the Fleet Modernization Program. Installation funding supports expected service life and maintains the surface combatant's machinery and ship control systems. This functional code is also utilized to execute Maritime Energy Initiative installation tasks displayed on the P-3a exhibits.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (TMCS)]: The Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is the largest distributed system on a Surface Combatant and typically consumes between 25% and 40% of all energy used.  Surveys on several DDG-class ships indicate that average space temperatures across the ship were being maintained well below the design temperature.  Thermal Management Control System (TMCS) provides centralized control and monitoring of space temperatures at design set-points for each compartment throughout the ship.  This technology enables improved operational efficiency of the HVAC system, thereby lowering AC loads and reducing electrical demand.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Bow Bulb)]: Bow bulb is a near surface, small volume design for installation on the destroyer's bow in combination with the existing sonar dome.  Modification of bow shape reduces hull wave drag without an increase in hull resistance, reducing fuel consumption.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (VSD for CPS)]: The Collective Protective System (CPS) is a full time air filtration system integrated into the ship's HVAC system.  The amount of outside supply air delivered to CPS zones varies with filter loading over time and is almost always higher than needed, resulting in above average HVAC loads.  Variable Speed Drive (VSD) will be installed as an airflow control component to optimize supply air flow, realizing energy savings from fan motor and reduced HVAC loads.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (SSL)]: Solid State Lighting (SSL) lamps consist of individual Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which serve as replacements for incandescent and fluorescent lighting fixtures.  SSL replacements  are engineered to meet military specifications.  SSL replacements for incandescent and fluorescent fixtures reduce energy usage by approximately 85% and 50%, respectively.  Additionally, this install will drastically reduce the electrical lighting load, maintenance actions, and the space needed for spare parts.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT IIA)]: The Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT IIA technology is a shipboard tool providing real time situational awareness of the energy demand associated with equipment lineup and mission.  Technology raises operator awareness of how certain engineering plant lineups and equipment affect fuel consumption rates.  Energy savings will be realized through energy usage culture change.\n\n[P3A - 6 \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT I)]: The Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT I technology is a shipboard tool providing real time situational awareness of the energy demand associated with equipment lineup and mission.  Technology raises operator awareness of how certain engineering plant lineups and equipment affect fuel consumption rates.  Energy savings will be realized through energy usage culture change.\n\n[P3A - 7 \/ GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Triton Fuel Penalty)]: Triton Fuel Penalty is a system capable of reporting in real time when a ship's powering condition has degraded due to increased drag from bio fouling.  Personnel will be able to schedule ship cleanings utilizing feedback taken from actual measurements of drag while in service. This capability will reduce the current penalty paid by the fleet to overcome the negative effects of biological fouling on ship performance and fuel expenditure."

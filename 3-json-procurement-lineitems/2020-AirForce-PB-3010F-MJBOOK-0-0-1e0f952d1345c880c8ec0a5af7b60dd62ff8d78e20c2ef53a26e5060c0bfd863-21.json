            "val": "1.) The Engine Depot Stock & Preservation Kit buy provides initial spares to support depot operations during the transition from the Maintenance Service Rate Plan (MSRP)\/Globemaster Integrated Sustainment Program (GISP) overhaul construct to the Engine Sustainment Services (ESS)\/GISP overhaul construct. This follows a Secretary of the Air Force (Sec AF) directive to procure engine sustainment outside of the GISP Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.  \n\n2.) Purchase of Peculiar and Common Support Equipment for the C-17 (PSE and CSE). CSE is comprised of support equipment used by the C-17 and other programs, while PSE is unique to the C-17. Both are required to effectively operate the Organizational and Intermediate (O&I) levels of aircraft maintenance at Main Operating Bases (MOBs), Avionics Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), Engine RMCs, Enroute locations, Backshop activities, plus requirements in support of the Boeing Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) and WR (Warner Robins)-ACI Global Reach Improvement Program (GRIP) contracts.\n\n3.) The Post Production Product Improvement (PPPI) program funds Materiel Improvement Program (MIP) projects. MIP projects correct Deficiency Report (DR) issues that were discovered during the aircraft production phase. There have been over 275 projects incorporated into production aircraft. About 38 projects remain to be retrofitted to post production aircraft to bring them up to production aircraft configuration. The projects are worked in conjunction with aircraft heavy maintenance (depot) cycle every 5\/6 years. Funds remaining in the FYDP will be used to complete PPPI projects initiated with APAF.\n\n4.)  C-17 Weapon System Trainer (WST)- The purpose of this effort is to procure and install two (2) Weapon System Trainers (WST)s.  The WSTs are simulators which support C-17 continuation training, in-unit upgrades, in-unit requalification, initial and refresher maintenance engine run qualifications, and new full spectrum readiness requirements to include chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological training and mission employment scenario training. The effort also includes site preparation and activation of C-17 training systems sites. \n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401130F and 0401897F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "1.) Engine Depot Stock & Preservation Kit buy - This is required due to the Secretary of the Air Force's (Sec AF) directive to breakout F117 engine overhaul outside of the GISP CLS umbrella.  This requires the purchase of initial spares in order for the depots to operate effectively.\n\n2.) Purchase of Peculiar and Common Support Equipment for the C-17 (PSE and CSE) - If not funded, C-17 operational readiness and aircraft availability will be impacted negatively. In addition, the safety of maintenance and shop personnel working will be put in harm's way.    \n\n3.) Post Production Product Improvement Program (PPPI) - The FY19 budget supports PPPI for 21 MIP projects to be installed on 35 aircraft.  MIP projects significantly increase aircraft Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RM&A).  Project completion also contributes to the common configuration and reducing the lifecycle costs of the C-17 fleet.  MIP projects include, but not limited to:\na.) Redesign Wing Fillet Panel \nb.) 1553 Data Bus Pre-Electrical Power Improvement Retrofit \nc.) Pneumatic Manifold Slip Joint Leakage \nd.) Lavatory Drain Leak \ne.) Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter \nf.) AC Pack Refrigeration Unit Reliability\ng.) Spoiler Bushings and Bearings\n\n4.)Simulator training improves aircrew training quality by increasing standardization and the frequency of training at a much lower cost than can be achieved in the aircraft.  At a minimum, units require continuation\/refresher training quarterly.  A co-located simulator allows training to be conducted locally, which reduces fuel and TDY costs by an estimated $976K per year.  The average monthly hours used per training system is 275 hours."

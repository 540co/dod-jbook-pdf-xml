Modifications included in the budget support fatigue life, obsolescence and performance enhancements to ensure the system remains operational throughout the life of the program. AAG will replace Mark 7 arresting gear aboard Ford Class aircraft carriers and will provide the U.S. Navy with the ability to recover existing and projected aircraft carrier based tail-hook equipped air vehicles well into the 21st century.  AAG will enhance operational capability, provide increased operational availability, while reducing manning, maintenance and support costs.  AAG is installed aboard CVN78 as well as two land based test sites JCTS and RALS. \n\nFY2017 and prior funded under Aircraft Support Equipment (BLI 4213, and BLI 4216)."

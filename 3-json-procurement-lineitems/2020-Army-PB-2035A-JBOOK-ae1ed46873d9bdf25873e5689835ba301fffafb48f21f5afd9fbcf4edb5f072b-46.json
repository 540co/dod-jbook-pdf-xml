JTAGS, first fielded in 1997, has four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM). A fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  Obsolescence issues coupled with the desire to take advantage of the Air Force's investment in newer satellites (Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS)) and their improved warning accuracy and timeliness, resulted in the JTAGS Block II Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) system. Block II systems are currently being fielded, replacing the legacy Block I fielded systems. The JTAGS Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is five systems."

            "val": "The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) Hardware program procures commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computing systems hardware and hardware-related requirements for Air Force active duty, Guard, and Reserve units worldwide.  These computing systems provide a flexible, configurable and cost-effective range of increasing capability to meet the continuum of peacetime, contingency and wartime planning requirements.  These electronic systems provide a mission data management system that efficiently interfaces with other planning systems as well as aircraft avionics.  These computing systems are procured on a four-year life cycle replacement to effectively address and\/or alleviate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Once procured the systems are centrally managed for all applicable AF platforms and their operational users, including Guard and Reserve Forces.\n\nThe program continues the procurement of COTS computing hardware and other devices associated with the Mission Planning Systems program.  It also continues the procurement of all capital replacement hardware used in conjunction with MPS and other pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning software.  Together this hardware and associated software enables aircrews and other planners to plan the safest, most effective operational missions in a timely manner.  \n\nThe program procures COTS based Personal Computing (PC) Systems to include (but are not limited to) desktop computers, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDA), tablet PCs, color printers, storage devices, displays, other peripherals, software and software licenses, and other support services, that together, allow the user to produce the necessary charts and other mission-specific products required to effectively perform a variety of military missions. \n\nA variety of information technology, navigation and communications hardware and software packages will also be procured each year to meet the varied needs of mission planning platforms and training units.  This PC-based capability, when integrated with corresponding mission planning software releases, provides a portable, tailorable, net-centric system for aircrews to complete the mission planning function.  The procured items also enable aircrews to effectively utilize software that has been modified to stay in sync with new capabilities incorporated into select platforms via their Operational Flight Program (OFP) update process.  They also provide a mission planning capability for precision\/autonomous guided munitions and can also be networked with other Theater Battle Management (TBM) systems to further tailor a platform's mission planning environment. \n\nThe MPS procurement strategy leverages the rapid increase in PC-based technology to enable high-end computing on increasingly smaller and more mission-oriented devices.  The programs procure UNIX and PC-based systems that provide flexible, configurable, and cost effective solutions that increase tactical and strategic capabilities to meet the continuum of operations ranging from peacetime contingencies to conventional and nuclear wartime mission planning requirements.  Each segment of the program has shifted its hardware emphasis from a limited number of large, complex planning systems to more compact and personal planning devices that can be tailored to satisfy user needs.  This adjustment is a practical and efficient way to meet technology-driven challenges such as the evolutionary nature of mission planning (that necessitates recurrent hardware changes to meet overall system requirements) and advances in COTS technology that makes available new capabilities (which may lower component costs or address component obsolescence).  It is also a more effective way to address changes in the number, type, and deployment of aircraft\/weapons that force changes in the number of UNIX and PC-based mission planning computers and their concept of operations.  \n\n1. MISSION PLANNING SYSTEMS (MPS) HARDWARE:  This acquisition is a continuation of procurement efforts to provide MPS-related hardware for Air Force platforms.  The program will provide a suite of COTS-based mission planning hardware and software systems that can be integrated with USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems for the operation of USAF aircraft (e.g. F-22, B-1, F-16, F-15, RC\/OC-135, E-3, E-4, E-8, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, HH-60, KC-135, KC-46, C-5, KC-10, C-17, A-10, F-35, Global Hawk, U-2, B-52, B-2, UH-1, T-38) and the support of USAF training requirements.  MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information.  This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including equipment and personnel airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) that is electronically transferred to aircraft and\/or precision-guided weapons.  MPS increases the combat effectiveness of Air Force aerial assets (including unmanned air vehicles, conventional and low-observable aircraft, and weapons) and Army guided delivery systems by supporting the use of sophisticated avionics and precision\/autonomous guided munitions.  It helps to increase wartime sortie rates while improving aircrew and aircraft survivability and aircrew readiness.\n\n2. PRECISION AERIAL DELIVERY SYSTEM (PADS): PADS provides the capability for direct delivery of cargo and equipment through high altitude, precision airdrops (principally with C-17 and C-130 aircraft).  Currently it consists of the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) acquisition effort.  JPADS is a collaborative effort with the Army, USMC, and other agencies to provide aviators the ability to accurately airdrop payloads (including supplies\/equipment and personnel) to units in the field from altitudes beyond the reach of some surface-to-air weaponry.  This portion of the program procures COTS-based computing hardware, support services and aerial delivery systems to enable completion of pre and in-flight mission planning functions as well as aerial delivery proficiency training in and with operational units. \n \nMarket surveys and analysis of COTS products will be used to support procurement decisions.  Funding for this exhibit is in Program Element (PE) 0208006F.\n\nThis funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0208006F."

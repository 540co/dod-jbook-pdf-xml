Currently, the M9 Pistol, which has been utilized as the Department of Defense's personal defense weapon since 1985, is being replaced by the new M17 Full  size Modular Handgun . The M18 Compact size Modular handgun will replace M11 handguns.  The MHS is a Commercial Off the Shelf\/ Non-Developmental Item (COTS\/NDI) which delivers a more capable system (weapon, ammo and magazines) consistent with the planned force structure and emerging operational needs of the Army.  The MHS addresses M9 and M11 shortcomings with improved lethality, target acquisition, ergonomics, reliability, durability, and maintainability.  The MHS is ambidextrous capable and accommodates 5th-95th percentile users via modular grips and access to all controls with one hand."

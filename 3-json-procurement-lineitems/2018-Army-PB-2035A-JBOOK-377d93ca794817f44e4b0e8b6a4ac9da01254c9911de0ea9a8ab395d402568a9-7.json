Phoenix provides the Army operational flexibility by operating over four bands (C, X, Ka, and Ku) on military and commercial satellites resulting in less dependency on costly and high demand commercial satellites.  Fielding is to Active, Reserve and National Guard Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs). The Army decided to retire legacy AN\/TSC-85 terminals by 2015 and replace them with SHF (Phoenix) terminals and upgrade all Phoenix terminals from 20 to 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) aggregate capacity to meet growing capacity demands.  This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.\n\nThe Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the SHF Terminal is 112."

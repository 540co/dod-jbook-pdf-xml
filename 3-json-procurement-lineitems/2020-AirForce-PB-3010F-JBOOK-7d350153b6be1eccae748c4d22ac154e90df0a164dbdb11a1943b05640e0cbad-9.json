CAP also provides an organization to assist in meeting local emergencies and assists the Dept. of the Air Force in non-combat program\/missions.                                                                                         \n\nThis program has no initial spares cost.  The weapon system cost, flyaway unit cost, and weapon system unit cost do not apply. \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0901223F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M.

            "val": "The Construction Equipment (CE ESP) budget line funds the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) across the Construction Equipment\/Combat Engineer portfolio and supports the Engineer Strategy by extending current construction capability to bridge the gap until new procurements. The SLEP candidates include the Deployable Universal Combat Earthmover (DEUCE), Dual Steel Wheel Roller (DSWR), High Speed Compactors (HSC), Vibratory Rollers, All Terrain Crane (ATEC), Hydraulic Excavator (HYEX), Scraper 613C, 7.5T Crane, Engineer Mission Module (EMM) and select components of the asphalt mixing plant (AMP). The CE SLEP is a commercial off the shelf program (COTS).\n\nThe DEUCE is a rubber-tracked dozer used in clearing, leveling, and excavation operations. It is C-130 airplane transportable and can be dropped by parachute at low velocity. It can travel at speeds up to 30 miles per hour (MPH) eliminating the typical construction equipment requirement of trailers and additional haul assets. The DEUCE rubber tracks allow construction, loading, and off-loading on airfields and paved roads without damage. No replacement solution provides these capabilities at this time.  The SLEP Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for DEUCE is 214 systems.\n\nThe Dual Steel Wheel Roller (DSWR) is a self-propelled vehicle consisting of two steel drums, a diesel engine, and a hydrostatic drive. It is a commercial system used to compact bituminous material in paving operations. The SLEP AAO for DSWR is 30 systems.\n\nThe High Speed Compactor (HSC) is equipped with articulated steering, a dozer blade, a diesel engine, and has segmented impact pads on each of the four drums. It is capable of compacting various soil types in forward or reverse at speeds up to 12 MPH. The SLEP AAO for HSC is 152 systems.\n\nThe Vibratory Rollers Type I, Type II, and Type III are self-propelled single drum rollers equipped with vibratory action, and are used to level and compact all soil types.  The combined AAO for Vibratory Rollers Type I and Type III is 88.  The SLEP AAO for Vibratory Rollers Type II is 394 systems.\n\nThe All Terrain Crane (ATEC) is a hydraulic, all terrain crane capable of traveling over primary, secondary and off road surfaces at the tactical support level.  Technical characteristics include: diesel engine, power shift transmission, three mode steering, independently controlled hydraulic outriggers and a 70 foot telescoping boom.  The ATEC supports construction, maintenance bridging and resupply activities.  The SLEP AAO for ATEC is 215 systems; in addition the Armor Kit requirement is 29.\n\nThe Hydraulic Excavator (HYEX) Type I, II and III is a commercial item of construction equipment with minor military modifications. It is a diesel-driven, self-propelled, track mounted, hydraulically controlled system equipped with a hydraulic quick disconnect coupler for use with a wide variety of attachments. The SLEP AAO for HYEX Type I is 189 systems.\n\nThe Scraper (613C) is a non-sectionalized\/sectionalized scraper used by Engineer Support Companies for earthmoving maintenance and construction of roads and airfields.  The sectionalized scraper can be sectionalized into two sections for transport by helicopter. The SLEP AAO for Scraper (613C) is 210 systems.\n\nThe 7.5T Crane is used primarily in light cargo handling units where mobility is required.  It is capable of safe operation in explosive environments at Ammunition and Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant supply points and can be used by ordnance companies, petroleum platoons and maintenance battalions.  The SLEP AAO for 7.5T Crane SLEP is 232 systems and is only to fulfill PEO Aviation requirements.\n\nThe Engineer Mission Module (EMM), Water Distributor is one of four Engineer Mission Modules which are demountable, systems capable of repeated transport, operation and use with Load Handling systems (LHS) type trucks and associated trailers.  The four EMMs are the EMM-Dump Body (DB), EMM-Concrete Module (CM), EMM-Bituminous Distributor (BD) and EMM-Water Distributor (WD). The SLEP AAO for EMM is 302 systems.\n\nThe Asphalt Mixing Plant (AMP) is a portable drum type, electric motor driven facility, capable of self erection (major components), and satisfactory operation without requiring permanent type footings.  It consists of major units, components and accessories as required to assemble a complete plant capable of producing 150 tons per hour of graded asphalt paving mix.  These units are trailer mounted and can be interconnected mechanically and electrically, and operated to rated capacity. The SLEP AAO for AMP is 2 systems."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $19.032 million provides refurbishment of approximately 86 vehicles consisting of the ATEC Crane, DEUCE, Vibratory Rollers I\/III and II, 7.5 Ton Crane and Compaction Equipment.   The Construction Equipment (CE) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is the engineer's lifeline to sustain the current force.  The SLEP is critical to maintaining engineer unit's operational readiness standards by extending the life of many different CE vehicles by 10-15 years.  It returns vehicles to the field with zero hours and zero miles with a manufacturer new vehicle warranty of 18 months.  This program lowers the Army's operation and support costs normally associated with aged equipment.   The SLEP is conducted at government and contractor facilities worldwide to include Germany, Italy, Korea, Kuwait, and the USA.\n\nThis program is considered a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

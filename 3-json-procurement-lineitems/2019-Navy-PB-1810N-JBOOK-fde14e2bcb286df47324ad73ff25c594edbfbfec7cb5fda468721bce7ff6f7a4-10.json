            "val": "The Submarine Support Equipment budget provides for equipment technical refresh and upgrades that consist of hardware, software, system engineering, integrated logistics support, system test and evaluation, training, data, alteration installation teams and program management. This funding also procures equipment and material used to implement the military high priority Submarine Silencing Program for operating nuclear submarines. These silencing program equipment technical refreshes and upgrades are not supported by other NAVSEA program offices and support SSN\/SSBN\/SSGN Class submarines and land based laboratories\/facilities. As the VIRGINIA Class submarine program matures and more submarines enter the operational and sustainment phase of the lifecycle, Navy leadership made a decision to transfer funds for modernization and maintenance upgrades and obsolete equipment replacement from new construction program to the Submarine Support Equipment account for these items to be executed on operational VA class submarines.  \n\nThe installation funds are provided for the Ship Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) Governors on SSN688 and SSN21 Class submarines, acoustic range array replacement, Ship Control System Processors for SEAWOLF Class submarines, and SSN Class Component Upgrades.\n\n[P40A \/ Propulsor Upgrade Procurement]: Propulsor Upgrade SHIPALT 4548K - Current propulsor design on VA class in-service ships exhibits excessive corrosion problems. A SHIPALT has been developed to accomplish modifications to the propulsor, shaft, bearing snubber, forward outer structure cover plate, rotor tailcone, rope guard, fastener system, and associated local cathodic protection system, to achieve a 156 month corrosion protection system for the propulsor without interim repairs or replacement. Backfit installation was initially started by the VA Class program office and has transitioned to PMS392 to procure the remaining three ships of the five shipsets and install the remaining five shipsets.\n\n[P40A \/ SSTG Digital Voltage Procurement]: SSTG Digital Voltage Regulator upgrade (SHIPALT 4884K) - Existing SSTGs on early VA Class submarines have analog voltage regulators, which are obsolete and unsustainable. SSN 780 and later ships were delivered with the new design Digital Voltage Regulator. A backfit SHIPALT has been developed to replace the analog voltage regulators on SSN 774-779 with the new digital design, targeted to begin in FY18. This effort began under budget line item 0942 and has transitioned to 0941 beginning in FY18 where the remaining shipsets will be procured and installed.\n\n[P40A \/ ICS Block 1 & 2 Design Change Procurement]: Integrated Communications System (ICS) Block 1 & 2 and Block 4 - The interior Integrated Communication System installation on VA Class ships Block 1 & 2 hulls is a COTS based system designed in the mid-1990s and first installed in 2002.  Much of the design is now obsolete and unsupported. The ICS must be operational to meet underway requirements.  To resolve current parts obsolescence, procurement and backfit of key replacement components (example, processor cards, graphics cards, Asynchronous Transfer Mode switches, Linear Displacement Transducers) on Block 1 & 2 platforms is required to ensure continued operation in the near term.  This effort began in line item 0942 and transitioned to 0941 in FY18.  To address continuing future obsolescence of the ICS, a system redesign and replacement via SHIPALT is required.  SHIPALT development leveraging the Block 4 ICS design will commence in FY19 with procurements and installs in following years.\n\n[P40A \/ Bulkhead 6 Tile Maintenance SA 4563K Procurement]: Bulkhead 6 Tile Replacement (SHIPALT 4563K) - Modifies the Bulkhead 6 damping tile arrangement and tile design in the Main Ballast Tank to facilitate required recurring maintenance including ultrasonic hull inspection efforts, eliminating the need to remove\/replace the attached damping tiles during scheduled availabilities, which is a significant cost and schedule savings during planned depot availabilities. This effort began under budget line item 0942 and has transitioned to 0941 beginning in FY18 where the remaining four of five shipsets will be procured and all five will be installed.\n\n[P40A \/ DGIOTS Shock Modification SA 4776K Procurement]: Diesel Generator Independent Over Speed Trip System (DGIOTS) Shock Modification (SHIPALT 4778K) - The DGIOTS control panel on VA Class Blocks I\/II has obsolete components and fails to meet requirements for shock and vibration. SHIPALT 4778K provides a shock\/vibration-qualified control panel using current, supportable technology. Backfit installation of the SHIPALT is planned for SSN 774-781 (782 - 783 received at PSA). Material lead time is less than 12 months.\n\n[P40A \/ Fwd Automatic Bus Transfer Pwr Mod Procurement]: SSN Class Component Upgrades - Forward ABT Power Modification - The in-service VA ships in Block I\/II have received the Hotel Services SHIPALT which included Static ABTs and power transformers to support increased forward electronics processing capability for continuing SWFTS sonar\/fire control tech insertions. At-sea operations have since identified problems with loss of electronics processing in conjunction with a loss of power to a forward electrical bus. A new construction change for blocks III\/IV platforms is in progress, but a backfit SHIPALT for a power distribution upgrade on blocks I\/II must be developed and fielded on SSN 774-783. Material lead time is estimated to be less than 12 months.\n\n[P40A \/ MRO Shock Mod SA 4629K Procurement]: MRO Shock Modification (SHIPALT 4620K) - Accomplishes design changes on 20 MROs per ship to meet shock qualification requirement. The MROs are for valves AHP-33, TD-138, DSW-1, DSW-2, TD-128, TD-65, TD-129, SDA-8I, PL-2, SDA-82, TD-127, TD-49, SDA-53, SDA-54, SDA-41, TD-125, PL-81, EAFW-244, EAFW-245 and EAFW-67. Backfit installation of the SHIPALT is planned for SSN 774-781 (782 - 783 received at PSA).\n\n[P40A \/ Circuit D\/Cath Protection Sys OER Procurement]: Circuit D \/Cathodic Protection System Obsolete Equipment Replacement (OER): Circuit D supports degaussing operations. The current design on block I\/II ships is 1990's COTS and is obsolete, requiring tech refresh to block III design via a backfit SHIPALT design and fielding. Additionally, future upgrade of the VA Class SWFTS sonar\/fire control systems to TI-16\/APB-15 or greater involve a change of middleware from CORBA to Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMPQ), requiring Circuit (CKT) D to also transition to AMPQ. This transition requires a CKT D redesign and upgrade by SHIPALT. The cathodic protection system on VA Class blocks I\/II ships uses an Impressed Current Cathodic Protection electronics that is COTS-based. Due to continued obsolescence with in-service ships, a complete system redesign is planned in new construction block V that would require backfit on in-service ships to allow the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system to continue providing hull structure corrosion protection and maintain interfaces with other systems like CKT D. The redesign effort for the two systems will result in separate SHIPALTS but are related due to system interfaces. Block I\/II platforms (SSN 774-783) require upgrade. Change applicability to Block III platforms is under review.\n\n[P40A \/ SSTG Reliability Upgrades Procurement]: SSTG Reliability Upgrades - Recent failures on in-service VA Class submarines of the SSTG bearing system design have identified the need for both short term and longer term corrective design actions. SHIPALT design development is required for several system improvements including modifications to the Bearing Thrust Housing Chamfer to increase air flow and reduce temperatures, the Bearing Thrust Moisture Sensor to seal sensor internals from moisture and reduce introduction of moisture to the thrust housing, and installation of a Flow Diverter to seal existing gaps between gland seals on the turbine and the forward end of the thrust bearing. These alt designs would be installed by fleet activities and not require headquarters procurement or install funding. Longer term corrective action for block I\/II ships (SSN 774-783) involves redesign and possible replacement of bearing system, depending on results of ongoing failure analysis. Impact to Block III platforms is to be determined.\n\n[P40A \/ Portable Ship Control Unit Installation]: Portable Ship's Control Station - The current Portable Ship's Control Station on VA Class Bocks I and II is obsolete and not supported for spare parts or replacement tablets.  This bridge suitcase is used to provide the officer of the deck with electronic chart navigation information and sensor contact information as well as ship's course\/speed\/rudder indication and related information while underway on the surface.  SHIPALT 4776 has previously been developed to install new designed Portable Ship's Control Station (PSCS) systems, and shipsets procured by the VA Class Program Office (PMS450) in BLI 0942 to support installations in FY19 and follow years.  Funding in 0941 provides for installation of these units.\n\n[P40A \/ VA Class Acoustic Superiority Prog Design & Dev.\/Tech Transfer]: VA Class Acoustic Superiority - Design Development - Funding will be utilized to execute requirements included in \"PEO SUBMARINES ASW CAMPAIGN PLAN UPDATE, 9073 Ser 450W4K\/S0116 of 2 Mar 2016\". This letter (SECRET) provides details on the plan to backfit new design Acoustic Superiority (AS) treatment on 5 BLK III submarines during their first Extended Docking Selected Restricted Availability (EDSRA), with follow-on installs on 6 BLK IV submarines during their EDSRAs. In addition, design work for backfit SHIPALT development for selected machinery improvements is included. AS treatment installations will be based on design and material developed for installation on USS SOUTH DAKOTA (SSN 790) as part of the South Dakota Improvement Program (SDIP) during PSA. Beginning in FY18, funding is provided for development of SHIPALT products for backfit installation of the AS treatment by Naval Shipyards on VA Class hulls, as well as for SHIPALT development for backfit of AS-related machinery improvements by EDSRA Shipyards or Fleet Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMAs). Engineering services are also funded to provide processes and procedures to the EDSRA shipyards for handling, setup and operation of staging enclosures and for the treatment handling and application equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ Acoustic Range Replacement Equipment]: Acoustic Range Replacement Equipment procures equipment and materials required to implement and support the military high priority Submarine Silencing Program for operating nuclear submarines. TYCOMs have consistently rated the conduct of noise trials as a high priority funding requirement. The requirements for this program are identified in Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Specific Operational Requirements 46-28 and Naval Sea Systems Instruction (NAVSEAINST) C9073.2B. This is the only program in place to procure equipment for the purpose of measuring, monitoring, assessing and improving the detection capability and reducing the detectability of deployed submarines. The equipment is used on test vessels, listening platforms and at the laboratories. This program replaces or refurbishes broken or obsolete acquisition and analysis hardware and software used to ensure ship's safety; and the execution and completion of acoustic trials objectives identified in CNO SOR 46-28 (assessment of ship's acoustic posture, etc.) and NAVSEAINST C9073.2B (Acoustic Surveys Policy). These refurbishments and replacements are especially critical in order to maintain the technological advances recently made in the area of acoustic data acquisition under the Acoustic Measurement Facilities Improvement Program and to utilize the South Tongue of the Ocean Acoustic Facility (STAFAC). Specific items include hydrophone arrays, towed arrays, ranging and tracking systems, on-board array electronics, noise sources, shore power cables, data fiber optic cables, data analysis systems, workstations, data storage and retrieval, communications systems, analyzers, tape recorders, accelerometers, monitors, etc.\n\n[P40A \/ SW Class SCS Microprocesor Proc Design & Dev]: SSN HM&E Threshold Modernization - Provides for replacement of SEAWOLF Class Ship Control System Microprocessing unit. The current Ship Control System microprocessors are obsolete and contain electronic components that are no longer support by industry.\n\n[P40A \/ SW Class SCS Microprocesor Procurement]: SEAWOLF Class Ship Control System Microprocessing Unit - This shipalt will replace Seawolf Class submarine ship control processing unit. The ship control processors are obsolete and contain electronic components that are no longer supported by industry.\n\n[P40A \/ LA\/SW Class Design and Shipalt Dev. for SSTG Governors]: SSTG Governors - Provides for replacement of submarine SSTG Governors on Seawolf Class and Los Angeles Class (MOD 25). The SSTG Governors in these submarines classes are obsolete and contain electronic components that are no longer supported by industry.\n\n[P40A \/ SSTG MOD 25 Procurement]: SSTG Mod 25 - Provides for replacement on SSTG Mod 25 Governors on Los Angeles Class submarines. The SSTG Governors in these class of submarines are obsolete and contain electronic components that are no longer supported by industry.\n\n[P40A \/ SEAWOLF Class SSTG Governor Procurement\/Installation]: PB008 - SEAWOLF Class SSTG Governors - Provides for replacement on SSTG Governors on SEAWOLF Class submarines. The SSTG Governors in these class of submarines are obsolete and contain electronic components that are no longer supported by industry."

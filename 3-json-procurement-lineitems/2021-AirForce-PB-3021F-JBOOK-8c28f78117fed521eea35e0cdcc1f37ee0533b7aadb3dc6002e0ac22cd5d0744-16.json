        "Description": {
            "val": "In FY 2021, P-1 Line Item RSLP00, Rocket Systems Launch Program (SPACE) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022F, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021F due to the creation of a new Appropriation for space Force. \n\nPer FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, was renamed the National Security Space Launch program, effective 1 Mar 2019.\n\nThe Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) procures small launch services to deliver affordable, flexible spacelift for small payloads.  The small launch program complements the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program with multiple options to acquire dedicated spacelift and rideshare services for developmental, demonstration, and small operational space vehicles.  The Spacelift Capability Production Document approved 31 May 2016 supports the requirement for small spacelift capability (0-8,000 lbs to low Earth through geostationary transfer orbit). \n\nIn FY 2019, the Air Force started using this procurement line for small launch services procurement requirements.  Previously, small launch funding resided in the satellite program budgets.  This change aligned launch service procurement activities with the necessary funding under Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Launch Enterprise.  This approach is now consistent across Air Force procured launch services and allows the Air Force the flexibility to manage dynamic manifest requirements as new launch service providers emerge.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  SMC is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThis program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares.  Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix of vehicles in the program.  RSLP procures launch services and is not a weapon system.  The program provides launch capacity for the Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements, but does not take ownership of any specific launch vehicle.  The requirements for small launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1206860F."

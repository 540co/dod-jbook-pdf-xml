These efforts mitigate key risks factors such as reliance on foreign sources and very limited or no domestic suppliers.\n\nNSS ISB - Infrared Sensor Substrates (Cadmium Zinc Telluride \/ Mercury Cadmium Telluride): The purpose of this effort is to establish and maintain a high quality production capability for Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) epitaxy grown on Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at key US-owned and operated foundries in order to assure the necessary supply of infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) to National Security Space (NSS) agencies when needed. The primary goal is ensure domestic availability of these detectors, and demonstrate on-shore MCT detectors are equivalent in performance to IRFPAs utilizing off-shore substrates. Additional awards were made toward this effort in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds. Further efforts are anticipated in FY 2020 utilizing prior year and FY 2020 funds.\n\nNSS ISB \u2013 ROIC Foundry Improvement and Sustainment: This project is a follow-on to a prior read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) project that focused on maintaining minimal, yet adequate, production capabilities at domestic foundries to ensure a necessary supply of strategic ROICs for Government space programs while simultaneously improving product design and processes. \n\nProjects Other (non-NSS)\/ISB:\n\nStrategic Radiation Hardened Trusted Microelectronics Foundry: The purpose of this effort is to provide an assured capability to produce or acquire strategic radiation hardened trusted microelectronics in compliance with Department of Defense instruction 5200.44 to supply critical microelectronic components for necessary radiation environments involved with the acquisition of delivery systems for nuclear weapons. The project provides production, engineering, and sustainment services in support of Strategic Radiation Hardened microelectronics fabrication via a Defense Microelectronics Activity-accredited Trusted Supplier using a Trusted flow. Multiple contracts have been awarded toward this effort in FY 2019 utilizing FY 2018 and FY 2019 funds.\n\nCritical Chemicals for DoD Missiles and Munitions: Multiple efforts are being scoped to address critical shortfalls in the domestic industrial capability to produce materials for DoD missiles and munitions. In January 2019, the President signed four Presidential Determinations addressing vulnerabilities in the supply chain for critical chemicals for DoD munitions, including: precursor materials, inert materials, energetic materials, and advanced manufacturing techniques for producing the materials. Relying on foreign sources, especially China, for these critical chemicals poses a risk to the Department's readiness to deter and defeat adversaries. Multiple projects are anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing FY 2019 funds.\n\nRare Earth Supply Chain: In July 2019, the President signed 5 Presidential Determinations addressing the rare earth elements supply chain, including: Light Rare Earth Separation and Processing, Heavy Rare Earth Separation and Processing, Production of Rare Earth Metals and Alloys, Production of Neodymium Iron Boron Rare Earth Permanent Magnets, and Production of Samarium Cobalt Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. This line of effort will establish a domestic industrial capability to support key aspects of the rare earth supply chain. China dominates the Rare Earth Elements (REE) market on a global scale in both mining and processing of RE raw materials and has the ability to manipulate global markets. Relying on foreign sources for these critical materials poses a risk to the DoD's readiness to deter and defeat adversaries. Important defense applications for the end product of this supply chain, REE permanent magnets, include jet fighter engines, missile guidance systems, antimissile defense, space-based satellites, and communication systems. Efforts are currently being developed to bolster the domestic industrial base to support the separation and processing of rare earth elements and domestic production capability for Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) rare earth permanent magnets. Multiple projects are anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.\n\nHypersonics Industrial Base: The DPA Title III program is actively working with stakeholders to identify gaps in the industrial capability to produce components for hypersonic systems and scale production from prototype levels to the required capacity. Multiple projects are anticipated to address hypersonic industrial base shortfalls, should the President authorize the use of DPA Title III authorities.\n\nAssured Electronics Supply: The challenges facing the electronics industrial base are wide-reaching and significant. Commercial industry has trended toward yearly product refreshes and updating technology nodes frequently, leaving legacy DoD systems that must be maintained for decades with severe obsolescence issues. On the opposite end of the spectrum, new systems that desire to integrate the newest technologies face challenges obtaining assured and\/or trusted supply as much of the electronics manufacturing supply chain has gone overseas. In addition, domestic suppliers that exist are reluctant to work with unique DoD requirements as it would negatively affect their commercial runs and overall business viability. The DPA Title III Program, in concert with its stakeholders, is working to identify and vet efforts to serve DoD's need for electronic materials, digital\/analog\/mixed signal integrated circuits, discrete components, displays, power electronic components, electro-optical\/IR components, radio frequency components, advanced packaging, and other cross-cutting technologies.\n\nSmall Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS): In June 2019, the President issued a Presidential Determination authorizing the use DPA Title III to strengthen the domestic industrial base for sUAS. The sUAS domestic industrial base has struggled to compete commercially in the midst of dominant foreign competition and DPA Title III is currently assessing where investments would best remedy the domestic industrial base shortfall and result in an economically viable domestic supplier. The DPA Title III program is working with stakeholders across USG to determine an appropriate investment strategy to enable the domestic industrial base to meet requirements. FY 2020 funds have been aligned to this effort with awards anticipated as early as late FY 2020, with additional efforts to follow depending upon the availability of funds.\n\nNext Generation Soldier Protection: The purpose of this project is to create a manufacturing capacity to produce lightweight, high-strength, inherently fire-resistant co-polymer aramid fibers to provide lightweight force protection for Soldiers and air, ground, and naval platforms and bases. Examples include lighter and stronger body armor, helmets, pelvic protection, enhanced combat vehicle survivability, enhanced aviation platform survivability, and integrated base protection. A next generation of co-polymer aramid fibers would provide a step-change increase in tenacity over existing fibers, a key attribute for enabling lighter-weight ballistic protection. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds, and funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers Production Capacity: Developed under funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), the Secure Hybrid Composite Container (SHCC) is an intermodal ISO shipping container providing advanced security features, while meeting all the operational, structural, and customs requirements of standard steel 20ft and 40ft shipping containers. The container includes the capability to be tracked during its shipment and alert officials to track deviations and alarms. The ultimate goal of the container is to provide the level of security to law enforcement officials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not been inserted into the container for smuggling into the US. Investment under Title III to establish initial production capability for the secure hybrid composite container can help satisfy an estimated 3,000 container per year initial government need from the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community agencies requiring secure shipping containers. A production line with an output of approximately 100 containers per year output is planned. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funding.\n\nShielded Infrastructures: The purpose of this project is to further increase the production capacity of conductive composite nanomaterials to meet emerging DoD requirements for light weight, unique form factor, electromagnetically shielded products. It is anticipated to leverage the success of a prior DPA Title III project by integrating and scaling the technology (chemical vapor depositioned nickel coated nano-materials) into other novel applications such as non-metallic enclosures, cases, laminates, injection moldings, wallpapers, paints, windows, etc. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.\n\nLithium Sea-Water Batteries: The purpose of this project is to establish the domestic production capability for Lithium Sea-Water (Li-SW) batteries. Currently, no commercially available battery technology has been tested to meet the energy-density, performance, and environment requirements needed to enable the Next Generation Airborne Passive Sensor (NGAPS) sonobuoys. The Office of Naval Research has conducted research and proven that Li-SW batteries will be able to meet the NGAPS requirements if manufactured in the required form factor. The need exists to establish a production line for Li-SW batteries, and to maintain affordable unit prices to support the DoD's needs. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.\n\nAlane (AlH3) Fuel: This project will create the domestic manufacturing capability for Aluminum Hydride (AlH3) or \"Alane\" Fuel.  Alane fuel is a high-energy-density fuel that is not petroleum-based and is environmentally friendly. Alane fuel cells utilized in Alane-fuel-powered systems provide higher energy density than the traditional lithium ion batteries on the market. Alane fuel-powered systems are alternatives to the traditional battery packs utilized in military platforms and by soldiers today.  These small form factor systems reduce the load carrying burden on soldiers and systems, therefore increasing mobility, operational effectiveness, and survivability. There is currently no domestic industrial manufacturing capability for these cells and a public\/private partnership under the authorities of Title III of the Defense Production Act will spur industry to create the initial capability to meet defense needs as well as provide an impetus for domestic commercial adaptability and use of the technology. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds, and funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nThin Wall Castings for Military Applications: Domestic foundries prefer to prioritize high volume, low-risk commercial work over low volume, high-risk defense work. This environment has led to a reduced number of suppliers qualified to provide large, aerospace-grade castings, limited investment in new technologies, and increased cost and lead-times for defense aerospace-related casting products. The objective of this project is to sustain and expand economically viable, merchant suppliers for large, complex, thin-walled aerospace grade magnesium and aluminum sand casting products for rotorcraft platforms, such as the CH-53K. This project was awarded in FY 2020 and is utilizing prior year funds.\n\nHigh Purity Beryllium: The purpose of this project is to ensure the availability of high purity Beryllium metal for DoD and national security requirements through capital improvements to an existing sole source supplier. Beryllium, a light weight metal, possesses unique properties that make it indispensable in many of today's critical defense systems. High purity beryllium is used extensively in structures, digital electronics, and instruments found in defense weapon systems where stiffness, low weight, good thermal conductivity, and dimensional stability are required. Defense demand for beryllium generally includes the following four areas: sensors, missile and satellite applications, avionics, and nuclear weapons managed by the Department of Energy. This project is a follow-on to a previous DPA Title III project from 2005 to 2012 which established the domestic production capability for primary High Purity Beryllium metal through the design and implementation of a facility. The current project will implement capital improvements required to gain production efficiencies at the facility constructed by the previous effort. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds.\n\nAN-SSQ Series Sonobuoys Production Capability: The purpose of this effort is to ensure the availability of qualified AN\/SSQ-101B sonobuoys. The domestic industrial base for AN\/SSQ series sonobuoys was deemed at risk of not being able to produce the needed classes and quantities of sonobuoys and would require assistance to establish the required production lines. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.\n\nF135 Integrally Bladed Rotors (IBR): The purpose of this effort is to expediently restore the domestic production capacity for 2nd and 3rd stage integrally bladed rotors (IBRs) for the F135 engine to minimize impact on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) delivery schedule. This effort mitigates the loss of a qualified source in the F135 engine's global supply chain. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing FY 2019 funds.\n\nThree-Dimensional (3D) Microelectronics for Information Protection: The purpose of this effort is to establish a domestic, merchant supplier manufacturing capability to provide two- and three-dimensional high density packaging technology, which accepts a wide range of custom and commercial-off-the-shelf components that can drastically increase the security of DoD platforms. This DPA Title III effort is working to create a low rate initial production capability of the packaging technology to enable the early DoD adopters to reliably procure products and achieve cost savings for their programs. The contract for this project was awarded in March 2018, and a second phase of this effort is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2021 utilizing FY 2021 funds."

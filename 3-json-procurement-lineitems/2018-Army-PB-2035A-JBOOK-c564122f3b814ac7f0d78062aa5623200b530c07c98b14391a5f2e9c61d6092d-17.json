Special and General Purpose vehicles are used in the direct support of facility engineering, maintenance activities, and for general administrative use in transporting personnel and cargo.  All vehicles are procurable from commercial sources.  Non-Tactical Vehicles is a vehicle replacement program that does not have a set Army Acquisition Objective (AAO).  Procurements are made to fill shortages or to replace vehicles that have reached an over-aged or unserviceable condition.\n\nGeneral Purpose Vehicles are of commercial design, intended primarily for general administrative use in transporting personnel and cargo.  Most vehicles are procurable from commercial production lines and include light to heavy trucks, such as carryalls, panel trucks, stake trucks, cargo trucks, trailers, troop carrier semi-trailers, utility trucks, fuel servicing tankers, truck tractors, and flatbed trucks.  Additional examples include blood mobiles, which are used for collecting blood; expandable semi-trailers used for recruiting missions; and light armored vehicles (LAV), which are used to provide inconspicuous force protection for missions and to provide protection for high level personnel who might be seen as targets.  These type of vehicles are procured from specialized vendors. \n\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles are commercially designed for specialized use in the direct support of facility engineering, maintenance and similar activities within an organization.  Examples include maintenance trucks, servicing platform trucks, refuse trucks, dump trucks, and other vehicles with mounted equipment."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $6.964 million supports installations and units with Non-Tactical Vehicles providing cargo and passenger transportation, in addition to facility engineering and maintenance capability.  74 Non-Tactical Vehicles are required to fill shortages and replace over-aged vehicles that are unsafe, over mileage, or uneconomical to repair. The 74 vehicles include 43 general purpose vehicles and 31 special purpose vehicles.  Among the General Purpose Vehicle types required are carryalls, stake trucks, cargo trucks, tractor trucks, and light armored vehicles.  These vehicles are needed at Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations where General Services Administration (GSA) leasing is not available (e.g. Japan and Korea).  Most Special Purpose Vehicles are not available from GSA to lease; therefore, support to the servicing, sanitation, and welfare missions of the field must be provided by procurement.  Service platform trucks, dump trucks, and other special purpose vehicles are required to continue the engineering support mission necessary to the operation of posts, camps, and stations worldwide.  An assessment will be made by the program office during the year of execution on the specific type of Non-Tactical Vehicles to be procured to meet current operational requirements. \n \nAll funding goes to the Active Component.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

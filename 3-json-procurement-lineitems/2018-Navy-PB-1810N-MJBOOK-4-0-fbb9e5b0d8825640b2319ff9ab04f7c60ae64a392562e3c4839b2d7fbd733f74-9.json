            "val": "Starting FY17, line items 7015 Materials Handling Equipment and 7050 Other Supply Support Equipment has been combined into line item 7025, Supply Equipment. \n\nMATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE): This program funds the procurement of Material Handling Equipment to satisfy operational requirements and replaces overaged non-repairable equipment used in material handling operations at world-wide Navy activities.  Major using activities include ships, naval magazines, air stations, weapon stations, and overseas support activities such as Sigonella and Sasebo. The MHE program also funds General Fund activities to meet known operational requirements for replacement of equipment which has exceeded its economic life. Overaged equipment is not cost effective to maintain for continued operation, and repair parts are difficult to obtain. Replacement of overaged equipment with new and more efficient models will reduce excessive costs attributed to repair\/overhaul, downtime and maintenance. New equipment will enhance productivity and enable stations to meet handling and logistics requirements in an efficient and effective manner."

            "val": "FY16 increase includes procurement of three 25K aircraft loader\/unloaders ($2.6M) critical to logistics operations at naval installations. Additionally, procurement of 18 Millennia Military Vehicle (MMVs) is critical to the success of expeditionary operations carried out by the Naval Construction Force ($2.9M). MMVs are armored which adds weight to the vehicles and results in additional wear. Navy-wide there are at least 4,489 pieces of Material Handling Equipment which will be more than 10 years old in 2016. This quantity includes gas-powered, diesel-powered and electric-powered forklifts and tow tractors that are critical to the operations of shore Navy Shore activities ($2.583M). The normal life expectancy for Materials Handling Equipment is 10 years. Navy must recapitalize the MHE inventory to support the Warfighter."

            "val": "Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements.  It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and\/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR)\/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8).\n\nThe funding line supports the conversion of Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) DeHavilland (DHC) 8-315 Aerial Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (AISR) aircraft systems, four (4) Saturn Arch (SA) and two (2) Desert Owl (DO), and the conversion of three (3) DHC 8-315 commercially procured aircraft beyond FY19. It provides for the following: the procurement of replacement and spare engines; procurement and associated testing of civil and military aircraft equipment, and future integration efforts. These modifications address all Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to current and evolving international and Army Standards. These modifications ensure continued worldwide deployment capability and safe operations. Lastly, this line supports future mods in service. \n\nSeparate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.  This budget line provides for aircraft modification and AZ2050 provides for sensors."

            "val": "FY 2020 funding totals include $0.0M for Base and $44.675M for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO); of which $44.675M and a quantity of 139,600 recapitalized (RECAP) cartridges is realigned as part of the OCO for Base Requirements. FY 2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy. The Budget requests these funds in OCO to comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\n(E15101) Artillery Cartridges, 75MM And 105MM, All Types\nThis budget line includes Cartridge, Artillery, 75mm & 105mm, All Types.\n\n(E21501) CTG, ARTY, 105MM HE, M1 W\/O FUZE\nThe 105mm M1 High Explosive (HE) cartridge contains a HE fill and is used primarily for training although some cartridges are expended in combat operations for fragmentation and blast.  The cartridge is loaded with an M67 propellant charge, consisting of seven numbered increment bags sewn together in numerical order.  Projectile function is dependent upon the fuze used and may function on impact (instantaneous or delay), above ground at a predetermined height or in proximity to the target area. Fuze function detonates the HE projectile filler resulting in projectile fragmentation and blast.  Range varies from 3.5 to 11.3 kilometers, depending on the number of charge bags used.  The program remanufactures\/recapitalizes the remaining unserviceable cartridges through replacement of M67 Prop Charge and Primer at a reduced cost over new production to provide a cost effective training cartridge.  \nThis item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\n(E21705) CTG, ARTY, 105MM IR ILLUM, M1064\nThe 105mm M1064 is a Infrared (IR) Illuminating Cartridge compatible with the M762 series ET fuze, M67 propelling charge, and is packaged in the PA117 Shipping Container. The M1064 consists of a 40 gram expelling charge, illuminant canister and parachute assembly. Upon fuze function, the expelling charge simultaneously ignites the illuminate while ejecting it from the projectile. Once dispensed, fins on the canister assist in reducing the spin rate while the parachute provides a descent rate of 12 meter per second (m\/s). The Infrared Illumination greatly enhances the effectiveness of night vision devices providing front line units with temporary battlefield infrared illumination to observe the movements and maneuvers of enemy forces under the cover of darkness.\nThe item is Code A approved for service use.\n\n(E21702) CTG, ARTY, 105MM VL ILLUM, M314A3\nThe 105mm M314A3 is a Visible Light (VL) Illuminating Cartridge compatible with the M762 series ET fuze, M67 propelling charge, and is packaged in the PA117 Shipping Container.  The M314A3 consists of a 40 gram expelling charge, illuminant canister and parachute assembly.  Upon fuze function, the expelling charge simultaneously ignites the illuminate while ejecting it from the projectile.  Once dispensed, fins on the canister assist in reducing the spin rate while the parachute provides a descent rate of 12 meter per second (m\/s).\nThe item is Code A approved for service use."

            "val": "This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The Distributed Common Ground\/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video (FMV) PED provides PED capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. The All Source Information Fusion will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture."

            "val": "This program is vital in conventional operations and irregular warfare. Beginning in FY16, the portfolio for Civil Affairs (CA) and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) includes 11 systems. These systems are critical to the Warfighter's capabilities in all overseas contingency operations, theater security cooperation, and stability, transition and reconstruction operations. These systems are deployed in support of the combatant commanders engaging with foreign audiences, joint interagency and multi-national operations before, during, and after military operations. The program enables CA\/MISO units to keep pace with the increasing Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MOTEs), rapid deployment rotational cycles, and the requirements of the Warfighter in various theaters of operations. The Army Acquisition Objectives for these 11 systems are 4 Fly Away Broadcast System-v2 (FABS-v2), 192 Media Production Center-Light (MPC-L), 4 Media Production Center-Medium (MPC-M), 33 MISO Print-Light (MISOP-L), 1 MISO Print-Medium (MISOP-M), 651 Next Generation Loud Speakers-Dismounted (NGLS-D), 641 Next Generation Loud Speaker-Mounted (NGLS-M), 708 Production Distribution System-Light (PDS-L), 10 Radio Integration System Lite (RIS-L), 846 SOF Deployment Node-Light (SDN-L), and 56 Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN).  In FY17 MISO is partnering with Defense Military Deception Initiative (DMDI) program to integrate Procurement prototypes with Component programs for acquisition, sustainment and maintenance."

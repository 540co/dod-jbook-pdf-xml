        "Description": {
            "val": "BASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) provides all Marine Corps installations with the base area network communications infrastructure that connects the end-user to the DISA network.  BTI supports, upgrades, and enhances the telecommunications systems infrastructure for all Marine Corps installations to meet the demands required to support the 5th Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  BTI is designed to maintain current industry standards related to technological capabilities for all voice, video, and data services transported via each installation's infrastructure.  These data services include support for, but are not limited to: telephony (including voice over internet protocol), video-teleconferencing, integrated services digital network, Marine Corps enterprise network, energy monitoring control systems, intrusion detection systems, access control systems, fire alarm control networks, and fleet training systems.  This includes supporting systems such as optical networks, telecommunications management systems, primary power, voice mail, and teleconferencing.  The ongoing focus is technology refresh and standardization on DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through modernization of installation infrastructure to maintain connection to the DISA network.  The BTI program is implementing the DISA UC Requirement at 17 Marine installations world-wide.  The upgrades of the installations are required to meet the BTI program Full Operational Capability (FOC) for Unified Capability (UC) for the telephone switch and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM) for the transport.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) is a framework of laws, policies, procedures, and technologies for the use of digital credentials, which provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in electronic communications and transactions. PKI allows secure access to IT systems. PKI has the ability to electronically sign documents, encrypt messages and documents, and to authenticate and protect web access... In compliance with DOD policy and direction, the USMC Public Key Infrastructure Program (PKI) program provides the resources, manpower and equipment (hardware and software), dedicated to the management (i.e.: generation, production, distribution, control, accounting and destruction) of keys and certificates used by public key-based security services to include NIPRNet and SIPRNet both garrison and deployed.  The PKI program operates the USMC Certificate Validation Infrastructure necessary to ensure that only authorized users and server based applications are allowed to operate on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN).  These services are required for user access to all information system components on the MCEN including network accounts, applications and web sites.  PKI must be operable in garrison and tactical\/deployed environments.\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS) is a centrally managed program to field a technology solution in support of emergency dispatch personnel that facilitates timely responses when emergency calls for service are received.  CERS provides command and coordination dispatch functions for first responders to support All-Hazard missions.  It standardizes Emergency Dispatch Centers to provide notification functions, resource management and situational awareness in order to increase efficient emergency and day-to-day first responder operations.  CERS capability is achieved through delivery of Enhanced 911 (E911) and emergency dispatch capabilities consisting of Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Fire Station Alerting (FSA) and Mobile Data Computers (MDC) for first responder's vehicles. \n  \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR): E-LMR is a modern, digital, Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 Trunked radio system at all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS).   It provides the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) communications that are required to support the Consolidated Emergency Response System and First Responders (i.e. Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services) as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiative.  Specifically, the radio system provides RF coverage to BPS populated areas and roads in-between, permitting positive command and coordination between Dispatchers and First Responders and enables their ability to respond to incidents during normal, crisis, and recovery operations.  In the wake of 9\/11 and the Ft. Hood incident, DoD recognized that effective emergency communications and mutual aid support operation are key elements in providing homeland security, reducing the loss of life and the preservation of property.  Thus, the objective for the E-LMR acquisition is to bring forth a reliable interoperability wireless communication system with a limited data capability.  \n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEER ENVIRONMENT: Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides the only Marine Corps organic, operationally relevant, Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Command, Control, Communication, and Computer (C4) architecture for testing and other engineering tasks. This environment is the sole organic solution in the Marine Corps for Link-16 Tactical Data Link Networks for air-to- air, ship, and shore targeting and messaging, validated at MCTSSA before Marine\/Navy use in theater.  The environment also provides Marine Corps organic equipment, environments, operators, and testers for Joint Communications Exercises, Joint Interoperability Testing, and Systems of System testing.  Funding supports modernization and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers.  The environment is essential to operating forces support for fielded C4 systems, as well as evaluating USMC and Joint C4 systems in a controlled, repeatable, and re-configurable manner that reduces program risk and identifies significant deficiencies prior to fielding to the operating forces.  More than forty Marine Corps C4 programs and systems rely on MCTSSA support.\nThe Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) Planning Yard is an initiative by Headquarters Marine Corps agencies and the Marine Corps CIO to establish a planning and test environment to engineer and technically evaluate changes to the MCEN.  Changes proposed to the MCEN by Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Information Technology (IT) Support Centers (MITSCs), the Marine Corps Cyber Operations Group (MCCOG), and USMC C4I acquisition programs will be evaluated in a controlled, standardized, and disciplined manner within the MCEN Planning Yard. Changes will be evaluated based on impact to cyber security, performance, and consistency of implementation across the MCEN.  The MCEN Planning Yard will also evaluate new technologies for potential introduction on the MCEN. Funding procures virtualization environments, cyber tools and test tools to enable proposed changes and new technology evaluation in an operationally relevant environment.  This effort was initiated in order to meet the requirements set forth by Sec. 1647 of the 2016 NDAA.  \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum information operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and a comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO into Marine Corps operations.  Multiple classification levels require separate Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support each classification level in accordance with National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency standards.  This includes equipment necessary for connecting internal MCIOC IT infrastructure (voice, video, and data) with the existing Marine Corps Base Quantico support infrastructure."

            "val": "FY2018 Justifications: $44.455M\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $32.893M:\n\nGrowth from FY17 to FY18 is due to BTI Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) install schedule, UC\/DWDM schedule, and E-LMR fielding acceleration.\n\n$22.783M will support the technology refresh and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at three Marine Corps installations. The funding increase of $13.582M from FY17 to FY18 is due to the increase in the number of installations receiving the UC\/DWDM upgrade and the alignment of the DPRI BTI installation schedule with the Guam construction schedule.\n \n$10.110M will support DPRI. FY18 funding is required to install base telecommunications infrastructure for two Japanese funded MILCON projects in Guam. These projects will establish a non-live fire training area in Andersen South and a waterfront headquarters facility in Apra Harbor. The Andersen South training facility will provide Marines with the ability to maintain readiness by conducting convoys, military operations on urbanized terrain, and breaching. The waterfront headquarters facility is required for the mobilization and de-mobilization of cargo and personnel in\/out of Guam.  These requirements are directly related to the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  \n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI):\n$1.409M funding will support the continuation of PKI hardware and software implementation across the (NIPRNet and SIPRNet) for both garrison and deployed networks in order to meet CYBERCOM's Tasking Order requiring the use of hardware tokens for access to networks, network resources and secure email in accordance with DODI 8520.02 and DODI 8520.03. Funding will also be utilized to procure necessary tokens and equipment for SIPRNet Token issuance across the MCEN as well as implementation of the DOD PKI NIPRNet Enterprise Alternate Token Management System. Funding increase of $0.171M from FY17 to FY18 procures additional infrastructure necessary to implement NIPRnet Enterprise Alternate Token System (NEATS) and Non Person Entity (NPE) when completed by the DOD Public Key Infrastructure Program Manager Office (PMO).\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS):\n$4.709M will support network connection, procurement and fielding of emergency dispatch systems to MCAS Iwakuni and MCB Camp LeJeune. The reduction in funding from FY17 to FY18 reflects the completion of the CERS solution at remaining installations.  \n \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR):\n$4.272M funding will support the completion of E-LMR Western Region Infrastructure contract to include network connection and implementation at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center-Bridgeport (MWTC).  The increase of $3.780M from FY2017 to FY2018 funds wireless Radio Frequency communications to support First Responders and Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiatives to attain Full Operational Capability. \n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT - EQUIPMENT & TECHNICAL SERVICES (TEEE):\n$.921M  Funding supports maintenance and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment Items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers.  The $5.745M decrease in funding from FY17 to FY18 is due to the FY17 funding received for the MCEN Planning Yard. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP):\n$0.251M Funding is for the refresh of hardware required on both the classified Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and unclassified Open Source Information System (OSIS) networks.  JWICS and OSIS are both provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) through Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). JWICS provides MCIOC with classified network connectivity and OSIS provides MCIOC with unclassified network connectivity. The $0.323M decrease from FY17 to FY18 is due to refresh schedule of JWICS and OSIS."

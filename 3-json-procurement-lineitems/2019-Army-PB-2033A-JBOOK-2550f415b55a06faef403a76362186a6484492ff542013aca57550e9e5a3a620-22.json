            "val": "The M320 Grenade Launcher Module (GLM) is a 40mm low-velocity grenade launching weapon system that is a direct replacement to all M203 series of grenade launchers on M16 Rifles and M4 Carbines.  The M320 GLM is a modular system that mounts under the barrel of the rifle or carbine.  This weapon can also be used in the stand-alone configuration.  The M320 GLM has an integrated leaf sight and some improved safety features.  This weapon also has a side-loading unrestricted breech that permits the firing of longer 40mm low-velocity projectiles (NATO standard and non-standard).\nThe M320 GLM is more reliable and safer because of the use of a more modern double-action trigger\/firing system.  The new pistol grip design eliminates the need to use the magazine as a hand grip.  The latest innovations in lightweight material composites improve durability.  Procurement of hand-held Laser Range Finder (LRF) and Grenadier Sighting System (GSS) are delivered as system components, one each per system. M320 GLMs will also be fitted with an additional system components, such as a 40mm fuze programmer, to properly enact the air burst capability present within the new 40mm Family of Ammunition (FOA)."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $.697 million supports the fielding efforts of the M320 Grenade Launcher Module (GLM) system.\n\nThe GLM provides deploying units an improved capability over the M203 grenade launcher and enables the Warfighter to more accurately engage the enemy in both daylight and darkness. The M320 is a safer, more reliable grenade launcher that reduces aiming error and increases first-round probability of hit. The M320 GLM 40mm ammunition is loaded from the side thus providing easier access and permitting use of a wider range of ammunition as compared to the M203, originally fielded beginning in the mid 1970s.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Act, (P.L.110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\n\nAAO:  68,860"

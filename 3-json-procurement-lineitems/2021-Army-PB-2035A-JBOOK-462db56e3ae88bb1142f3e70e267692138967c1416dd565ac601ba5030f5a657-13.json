            "val": "EMC supports the Global Response Force (GRF) requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft.  EMC modernizes enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth to support required Mission Command and Intelligence applications.\n\nThe Ka MWO will enable access to a faster, more reliable and robust network. The Ka satellite service increases the coverage map providing true worldwide coverage instead of regional coverage. Ka will provide a guaranteed data rate and up to 4 times higher throughput which will better enable mission command and simultaneous use of more data-intensive services that commanders can use such as UAV video streaming for greater situational awareness of the drop zone. Market research indicates multiple DoD stakeholders can collectively achieve price breaks and lower future bandwidth costs by up to 20-30% over Ku. This MWO, in conjunction with other DoD stakeholders' efforts, will provide a larger available pool of aircraft available for the Army and others to utilize decreasing maintenance downtime or unavailability of aircraft.\n\nOperational Needs Statement (ONS) 09-9319 was revalidated by the HQDA G-3 on 5 Nov 2014 to support fielding of the objective capability, which will support a full brigade lift of the Alpha echelon for a forced entry operation. (ONS) 09-9319 was  validated by HQDA G3 in 5 Mar 2013.  $21.275 million was provided in September 2013 via an Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) on SSN BB8417 Modification of In-Service Equipment (TACSAT) in support of that ONS to provide an initial capability.  \n\nFull Operational Capability (FOC) for Ku satellite band was met in Sep 2017.  Commensurate with rephasing of FY2017 OPA funding into FY2018\/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku SATCOM band FISA Full Operational Capability (FOC) (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka SATCOM band FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.\n\nInitial Operational Capability was met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on\/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN).  FOC is 35 Ku FISA equipped C-17s, eight KENs, 24 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and a Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN) airborne command post suite.  \n\nThe enduring requirement for EMC is documented in the Transmission Systems Capabilities Production Document (CPD), DAMO, CIC 30 January 2015.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

            "val": "This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of Aircraft and Aircraft components.  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars support the following: At RTC, procures Next Generation Airborne Instrumentation System which is to provide capabilities to support future flight test telemetry network operations in which the system must allow for data communication rates as high as 20Mbits\/second.  At YTC, continues procuring Aviation Production Instrumentation for the time stamping, on board recording and telemetering of data from standard 1553 data buses and sensors; and on board recorders and telemetry equipment that can meet the environment and data speeds needed for production base aviation programs. YTC also procures KTM Enhancements, KTM High Definition High Speed Camera, and Airborne High Speed Video to upgrade and replace obsolete, outdated imaging instrumentation for aviation testing.\n\nThe majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life. This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers."

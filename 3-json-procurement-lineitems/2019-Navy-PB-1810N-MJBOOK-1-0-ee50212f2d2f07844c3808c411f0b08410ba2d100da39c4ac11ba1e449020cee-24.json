        "Description": {
            "val": "This line item provides funding to procure Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) workstations, Software\/Production Engineering Support and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS). JMPS is the designated automated mission planning system for Naval Aviation, supporting over 40 Type\/Model\/Series (T\/M\/S), U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft and expeditionary forces. Future manned JMPS platforms include: P-8, C\/KC-130J,and CH-53K. JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, conduct mission rehearsal and post mission analysis. JMPS consists of two types of workstations - Maritime (JMPS-M) and Expeditionary (JMPS-E). JMPS-M is the primary product within the Naval Mission Planning System (NavMPS) family of systems, which include Electronic Kneeboard (EKB) and Common Munitions Built In Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE). The Navy's modern aircraft need data loaded from JMPS-M to fly their missions. As aircraft and weapons become increasingly advanced, they will require increased access, quantity, processing analysis and fidelity of data to support mission planning, mission execution and mission analysis. These data requirements will require additional advanced processors and greater amounts of continuous memory. JMPS-M flight planning seats refer to the computer workstations that employ the JMPS framework software. JMPS-E is a scalable, tailorable and collaborative web-based mission planning and execution monitoring tool for Amphibious Squadron Staffs embarked with each Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG). CMBRE provides USN\/USMC forces the critical capability to perform built in test and programming\/reprogramming of various weapons. Program cost is not directly related to FY hardware quantity; software is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost. Funding profile accounts for required four year workstation refresh cycle to preclude aging\/obsolete hardware and reduce failure rates, procure supporting emerging technology such as EKB, and next generation CMBRE starting in FY20 to support advanced operational capabilities and address system obsolescence\/cyber-security requirements\/mission readiness requirements and support memory requirements for required JMPS planning capabilities.\n\nPrior to FY17, the EKB was funded in BLI 4268."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "Items to be funded in this line include:\n\nWorkstation Components - JMPS-M and JMPS-E procure tactical computer hardware through a non-developmental item acquisition strategy. Tactical computer equipment is used to plan and analyze expeditionary missions and aircraft routes under various mission configurations and operational threat environments. Primary outputs are tasking orders, courses of action (COAs), Route Plans, Munitions \/ Weapons Plans, and Navigation and mission essential data loads for mission execution. New workstations consist of aircraft unique data transfer devices and interfaces, Memory Data Loader Receptacles (MDLR) Small Computer Standard Interface (SCSI) (MDLR-S), Electronic Kneeboard (EKB), Common Munitions Bit Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), Ogden Data Device Ethernet Crypto (ODD-EC), Data Storage Unit Receptacle SCSI (DSUR-S), network hubs, printers, fleet training school workstations, JMPS Application Central Access Library (JACAL), training assets, and other peripheral devices for USN\/USNR\/USMC\/USMCR missions. Next generation CMBRE OPN efforts begin in FY21. JMPS Authority to Operate (ATO) requires compliance with Naval Network Warfare Command (NNWC)-issued Information Assurance (IA) mandates and Communications Tasking Orders (CTOs). \n\nSoftware\/Production Engineering Support - The NavMPS program produces software releases via an evolutionary development process. These releases contain enhancements based on fleet inputs and technology challenges. They also contain changes required to retain compatibility with supported platforms, associated weapons, and threat and imagery databases providing input to NavMPS. Software releases are independent of hardware buys. This cost element includes production support services, engineering support services, independent verification and validation test and acceptance, site activation, IA compliance and quality assurance efforts. \n\nIntegrated Logistics Support - The NavMPS program conducts site surveys, prepares site installation drawings and provides on-site engineering and logistics evaluations for installations and delivery systems to ensure compliance with the specified configuration. This includes the production and delivery of technical documentation and training materials such as OPNOTES, installation instructions and user manuals required during the fielding of NavMPS products. ILS is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost. \n\nFY19 provides funding to procure seven hundred fifty (750) JMPS-M flight planning seats, five (5) JMPS-E workstations, Electronic Kneeboards (EKB), training assets, and other JMPS support equipment; continues the release of software enhancements based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies, cybersecurity mandates and associated logistics support. FY19 laptop procurement supports the FA-18, EA-18G, P-3 and V-22 platforms. This hardware is required to field critical electronic attack mission planning capabilities and support cyber security mandates which ensures air superiority and projected military force in contested areas. Updated hardware is required to continue to meet JMPS operational  \"Time-To-Plan\" requirements for complex platforms which include F\/A-18 (all variants) and EA-18G. Additionally, funding provides for database systems with storage space capable of storing National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) world-wide map data with associated network hardware. This will provide the Fleet with the required storage for map data, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and imagery necessary to plan missions.\n\nThe FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $0.042M to reflect the Department of Navy's effort to support the Office of Management and Budget directed reforms for Efficiency and Effectiveness that include a lean, accountable, more efficient government."

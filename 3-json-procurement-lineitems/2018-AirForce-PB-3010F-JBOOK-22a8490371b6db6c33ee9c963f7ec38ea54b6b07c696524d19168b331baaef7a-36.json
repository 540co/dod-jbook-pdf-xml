Use of enhanced, DMO-capable trainers provides a cost effective means of conducting daily training, mission rehearsal, joint force exercises, tactics development activity, and Virtual Aerial Refueling (VAR). This makes aircraft that would otherwise be used for training available to war fighting commanders to conduct combat operations. Funding establishes DMO capability for MAF DMO to include modification to MAF platform training systems and networks.\n \nDMS efforts to include removal of end-of life software\/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

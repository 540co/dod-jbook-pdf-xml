        "Justification": {
            "val": "The Defense POW\/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) provides families and the Nation with the fullest possible accounting for missing personnel from past conflicts.  As a Defense Agency, the DPAA leads the national effort to develop and implement DoD policy on all matters relating to personnel accounting from past conflicts, conduct global search, recovery, and laboratory operations to identify personnel from past conflicts, provide information and answers to the families of missing personnel, share their stories, and, when possible, bring home their remains.  This includes those who are unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean War, Cold War, Indochina (Vietnam) War, Persian Gulf War, the Iraq Theater of Operations, and other conflicts or incidents as the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) directs.  The DPAA also provides analytical support to official United States delegations and technical discussions with host nation officials.  Additionally, the DPAA is continuing to implement the transformation of DoDs personnel accounting for past conflicts as directed by the SECDEF, involving such things as enhanced strategic partnerships to more effectively account for missing personnel and to ensure their families receive accurate information.\n\nDPAA anticipates investigation and recovery operations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in FY2020 and requires reliable sport utility vehicles due to poor road conditions and inadequate repair facilities.  This is a new start in FY2020.\n\nDuring talks on July 15-16, 2018, at Panmunjom, Korea, between the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission, DPAA, the U.S. Department of State, and the DPRK's Korean People's Army (KPA) officials, the KPA offered to repatriate the remains of what are likely DoD personnel, and indicated that the DPRK would permit future remains recovery operations in the DPRK.  In an effort to open discussions about future recovery operations, the KPA provided a draft \"Record of Arrangement\" for consideration.  The draft, a revised version of the DPAA-KPA \"Record of Arrangement\" signed on October 20, 2011, details a concept of operations including logistics, communications, security, and medical evacuation support provided by DPRK during recovery operations.  In keeping with past practice, the DPRK will not permit DPAA remains recovery operations without such an arrangement.  \n\nIf an arrangement is reached, DPAA anticipates resuming field operations in Spring 2019.  DPAA requires passenger vehicles to transport recovery teams; therefore, a procurement action must begin no later than first quarter, FY2020 in order to ship the vehicles before operations begin.  As in past negotiations, we anticipate that the number of vehicles and other factors will be discussed and determined during the bilateral discussions with the DPRK."

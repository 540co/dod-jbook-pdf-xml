            "val": "This line item funds modifications to the EA-6B aircraft. The EA-6B Prowler is a four-seat, twin-engine, mid-wing, tactical, electronic attack aircraft. The EA-6B is flown by only Marine Corps squadrons in FY 2018 to provide DoD tactical electronic attack capability. The Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) is 12 ICAP III aircraft in FY 2018. Eighteen (18) ICAP III aircraft will be in Section 1 Level 1000 preservation in FY 2018. The designated service life is 12,500 flight hours, with an average of 3,450 flight hours of service life remaining per aircraft."
        },
        "Justification": {
            "val": "The EA-6B Prowler is a Low Density High Demand electronic attack platform. The aircraft are 40+ years old. Considerable modifications have been required in two basic categories to keep the systems viable: weapons delivery and airframe reliability. Weapons delivery includes Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) systems and its ancillary equipment. Several systems on the aircraft are based on obsolete software and techniques. Modifications are required to maintain safety of flight as the platform ages; Fatigue Life Expended (FLE), advanced corrosion, and tired iron must be addressed. These investments are required to keep the aircraft and its systems\/subsystems viable until the platform is retired."

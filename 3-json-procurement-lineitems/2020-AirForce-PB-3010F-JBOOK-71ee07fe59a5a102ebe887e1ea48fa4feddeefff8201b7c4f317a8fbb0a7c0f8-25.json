            "val": "This line item funds modifications for the fleet of 59 KC-10 aircraft. KC-10 has a divestiture strategy that will follow the FY19 NDAA. On average, the aircraft are 35 years old with 20 service years remaining. The three engine KC-10 serves a dual role by providing both air refueling and strategic airlift support.  The aircraft provides air refueling by using both the boom and the drogue methods and can carry up to 27 standard 463-L pallets. The primary modifications are Mode-5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Surveillance in combination with an FAA mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade, and Service Bulletins (SBs) that address obsolescence issues, provide worldwide civil airspace accessibility, and incorporate aging aircraft and FAA certification requirements. In FY19 AMC updated the Mode 5 requirement to all 59 aircraft.\n\nFunding may be used to address diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) issues.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401219F and PE 0401897F\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

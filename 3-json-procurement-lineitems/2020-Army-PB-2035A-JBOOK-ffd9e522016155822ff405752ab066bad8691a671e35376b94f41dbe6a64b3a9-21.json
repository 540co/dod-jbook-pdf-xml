The SEP evaluates available COTS, GOTS or NDI equipment to determine if items have the potential to provide increased combat effectiveness to the Soldier. The SEP OPA3 funding provides a means of procuring individual equipment designed to increase the Soldiers' operational effectiveness for evaluation."

            "val": "Note - FY2020, this effort was executed under budget line item 0013A01310 \/ Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS). \n\nThe Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the multi-domain operations concept that will employ cross-domain capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains. FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders.\n\nThe Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team (FVL CFT) is overseeing a demonstration effort in FY19-21 that will inform the Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) requirement to develop capability that will ultimately replace the RQ-7Bv2 Shadow TUAS within the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) formation. The demonstration effort will focus on conducting analysis and obtaining field data that will inform the FTUAS Capability Development Document (CDD). As part of the program development, a Materiel Development Decision (MDD) review will be held in FY2021 followed by a decision that will identify the appropriate entry into the Milestone Decision process.\n\nThe FVL CFT FUAS line of effort will be comprised of multiple components including the FTUAS for the BCT, Air Launched Effects (ALE) and Scalable Control Interface (SCI). The FTUAS seeks to replace the RQ-7Bv2 Shadow assets within the BCTs. Key attributes of the FTUAS focus on Rapid Deployability, Expeditionary Maneuver, and Mobility for adaptive and agile operations. FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including power generation, transportation, or command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, and programmatic support. Manned, optionally- manned, and unmanned systems will penetrate defense-in-depth environments by employing ALE with teaming and swarming effects to detect, decoy, jam RADAR and communications, conduct cyber-attack, spoof and jam GPS, and kinetic engagement."

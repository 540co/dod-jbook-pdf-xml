            "val": "Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) supports the United States Cyber Command (USCC) by enabling a critical need for the DoD Cyber Mission Force (CMF) to train at the individual, team, and force level.  The service cyber components have established their own training environments, but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability that utilizes shared content across the Services to include emulated network environments and has the ability to connect to other range environments.. The PCTE platform is aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment OUSD (A&S) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, \"Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations,\" dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE and the program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645.  With the JROC validation of the Information System - Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) on 4 November 2019, the PCTE program quickly achieved Milestone B on 6 December 2019.\n\n\nBeginning FY 2021, OPA funds reprogrammed program is funded in Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA) (APE 151251000, MDEP VLWA) for software licensing for cyber training applications. PCTE has procured and installed the appropriate hardware infrastructure footprint to enable the platform to serve the Cyber Mission Force user base."

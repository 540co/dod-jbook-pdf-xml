The ADC is a 3-inch expendable torpedo countermeasure (CM) that provides an over-the-side soft-kill defense against threat torpedoes. WPN funding provides new devices for fleet inventory requirements as identified in Naval Munitions Requirements Process (NMRP) necessary to equip identified surface ships and to replace expiring devices. The funding will also procure and install ready service and deep storage lockers to provide adequate storage on surface ships with countermeasure allowance.\n\nTD010 - ADC HARDWARE\nProcures the surface ship Acoustic Device Countermeasures (ADC).  Quantity requirements determined by NMRP and shelf life of older units (reaching end of life).  These requirements vary by ship type, location, and campaign. \n\nTD020 - ADC READY STOWAGE LOCKER\nProcures the Ship Change Document (SCD) package, procure and install ready service and deep storage lockers to hold ADCs on surface ships.\n\nTD830 - PRODUCTION ENGINEERING - In House\nFunding provides specification preparation and validation, government prepared production acceptance procedures, production planning, ILS planning, coordination of government furnished information (GFI) and government furnished equipment (GFE), contract deliverable monitoring and prime contractor monitoring of cost\/schedule performance.  Also provides inservice engineering agent (ISEA) and technical direction agent (TDA) support for ADCs on surface ships. \n\nTD900 - CONSULTING SERVICES\nFunding under this cost code provides fair share of contractor support to the program office, including program, financial, acquisition, contract, administration and engineering management support.\n\nTD905 - PRODUCTION ENGINEERING CONTRACTOR\nFunding under this cost code provides for production engineering tasks performed by the hardware contractor."

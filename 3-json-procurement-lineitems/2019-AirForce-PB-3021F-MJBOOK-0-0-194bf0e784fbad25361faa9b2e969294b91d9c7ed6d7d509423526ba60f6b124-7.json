            "val": "The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate time, three-dimensional position, and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. GPS satisfies validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid navigation for military aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and personnel. The system is comprised of three segments: (1) satellites, (2) a ground control, and (3) user equipment. The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The ground control network updates the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to provide system vectors to target location or navigational way points. Funds in this line support various GPS specific production efforts associated with the ground control and user equipment segments. \n\nKEY DATA LOADING INSTALLATION FACILITY (KLIF)\/GPS SECURITY DEVICE: The KLIF facilitates the programming of black key (cryptographic) algorithms into the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to provide accurate positioning solutions for GPS users using secure equipment. \n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\"\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in Program Element 1203164F NAVSTAR GPS (User Equipment)(Space)."

            "val": "In FY19, funding for BLI 4737 Procurement Marine Corps transitions to BLI 0444 STUASLO, Aircraft Procurement Navy (APN). \n\nThe requirement for the RQ-21A Unmanned Aircraft System is defined in a Capability Development Document, dated 18 November 2008 and further defined in the Capability Production Document, dated 15 February 2013.  The RQ-21A program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition process as an Acquisition Category III program on 26 July 2010. On 19 August 2014 RQ-21A was designated and Acquisition Category II program.\n\nThe RQ-21A system provides the Marine Expeditionary Force and subordinate commands (divisions and regiments) a dedicated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance system capable of delivering intelligence products directly to the tactical commander in real time. The RQ-21A system is capable of providing actionable intelligence and communications relay for 12-hour continuous operations per day with a short surge capability of 24-hours continuous operations for l0 days. The system has an operating radius of 50 nautical miles, further extendable through hub and spoke operations. The Air Vehicle is capable of airspeeds up to 80 nautical miles per hour with a service ceiling of 15,000 feet.\n\nAn RQ-21A system consists of five air vehicles, two ground control stations, modular multi-mission plug and play payloads, one launcher, one recovery system, and support equipment. Standard payloads include a turret mounted EO\/IR camera and a communications relay package with automated identification ship capability, carried in the payload bay.\n\nThe RQ-21A system will continue to evolve and upgrade capabilities to satisfy capability shortfalls, new requirements, and reliability, maintainability, and safety issues.  Upgraded capabilities may include Command and Control integration, weapons, heavy fuel engine, laser designator, frequency agile communications relay, digital common data link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-Optical\/Infrared camera."

Air Vehicles are procured with an Electro Optical \/ Infrared turret. Additional payloads are carried within the payload bay and include a communications relay package and automated identification system.   Launch and recovery systems are procured with associated peculiar support equipment.  Peculiar support equipment includes the AV fueling system, AV starter, battery charging station, transportation assemblies, cooling systems, shore power assemblies, AV scale system, and associated cabling.  Marine Corps unit costs increase in FY18 as Navy completes procurement eliminating the cost sharing benefits between services combined with material costs increases associated with capability enhancements.  In FY18 RQ-21 systems are procured with an upgraded EO\/IR turret which provides a  National Image Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS) rating of 7.0 or better at altitudes above 7,000 feet.  The incorporation of the improved turret corrects the major IOT&E deficiency for the RQ-21 Blackjack program.  Unit cost increase in FY18 is due to USN not procuring any systems, which aided with cost sharing, and also due to the fact of increased cost related to the updated EO\/IR Turret.",

Ship installation equipment and labor is captured in a separate non-recurring flyaway cost element.  In the FY15 President's Budget and prior, ship installation equipment was included within ancillary equipment.   FY18 is the last year of TIPS procurement.  In prior years each RQ-21 system was procured with two TIPS systems. In FY16 the Marine Corps changed the  TIPS procurement strategy and intends to procure a fixed number of TIPS systems Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron (VMU), reducing the number of systems the RQ-21 program procures. The Marine Corps updated RQ-21 Concept of Operations to focus primarily on support for Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) deployments.

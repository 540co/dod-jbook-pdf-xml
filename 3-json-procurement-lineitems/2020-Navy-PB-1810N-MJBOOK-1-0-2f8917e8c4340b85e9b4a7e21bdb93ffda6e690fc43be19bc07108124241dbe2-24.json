            "val": "This line item provides funding to procure Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) workstations, Software\/Production Engineering Support and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS). JMPS is the designated automated mission planning system for Naval Aviation, supporting over 40 Type\/Model\/Series (T\/M\/S), U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft and expeditionary forces. Future manned JMPS platforms include: CH-53K, CMV-22B and P-8. JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, conduct mission rehearsal and post mission analysis. JMPS consists of two types of workstations - Maritime (JMPS-M) and Expeditionary (JMPS-E). JMPS-M is the primary product within the Naval Mission Planning System (NavMPS) family of systems, which include Electronic Kneeboard (EKB) and Common Munitions Built In Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE). The Navy's modern aircraft need data loaded from JMPS-M to fly their missions. As aircraft and weapons become increasingly advanced, they will require increased access, quantity, processing analysis and fidelity of data to support mission planning, mission execution and mission analysis. These data requirements will require additional advanced processors and greater amounts of continuous memory. JMPS-M flight planning seats refer to the computer workstations that employ the JMPS framework software. JMPS-E is a scalable, tailorable and collaborative web-based mission planning and execution monitoring tool for Amphibious Squadron Staffs embarked with each Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG). CMBRE provides USN\/USMC forces the critical capability to perform built in test and programming\/reprogramming of various weapons. Program cost is not directly related to FY hardware quantity; software is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost. Funding profile accounts for required four year workstation refresh cycle to preclude aging\/obsolete hardware and reduce failure rates, procure supporting emerging technology such as EKB, and next generation CMBRE starting in FY 2020 to support advanced operational capabilities and address system obsolescence\/cyber-security requirements\/mission readiness requirements and support memory requirements for required JMPS planning capabilities.\n\nThe Next Generation Naval Mission Planning System (NGNPMS) will address critical capability gaps and deficiencies in the legacy JMPS that are required for modern 21st century integrated mission-centric and collaborative Multi-Domain Mission Management planning, execution and analysis. NGNMPS will replace Naval Aviation's legacy JMPS no later than 2027 while also affordably leveraging prior investments across the systems of systems to deliver integrated and collaborative capability. NGNMPS will affordably address technological obsolescence while also delivering collaborative and automated capabilities in an integrated virtual collaborative data environment. NGNMPS will also leverage service-oriented architecture to provide revolutionary improvements in workflow, usability, cybersecurity, information and decision aids need to rapidly plan\/employ\/maximize effectiveness of aircraft\/weapon\/sensor\/payload mission plans, advanced pre-mission rehearsal\/analysis, functionality to load mission data into aircraft and weapons, dynamic replanning\/retargeting against evolving threats in contested environments, integrated and advanced post-mission debrief\/analysis, cross-domain capabilities, and support for portability of mission planning, mission execution, and mission analysis functions. \n\nPrior to FY 2017, the EKB was funded in BLI 4268."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2020 provides funding to procure seven hundred fifty (750) JMPS-M flight planning seats, five (5) JMPS-E workstations, Electronic Kneeboards (EKB), training assets, and other JMPS support equipment; continues the release of software enhancements based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies, cybersecurity mandates and associated logistics support. FY 2020 laptop procurement supports the AV8B, C-130, C-2A, E-2C\/E-2D, MH-60R\/S and NLH platforms. This hardware is required to field critical electronic attack mission planning capabilities and support cyber security mandates which ensures air superiority and projected military force in contested areas. Updated hardware is required to continue to meet JMPS operational \"Time-To-Plan\" requirements for complex platforms which include F\/A-18 (all variants) and EA-18G. Additionally, funding provides for database systems with storage space capable of storing National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) world-wide map data with associated network hardware. This will provide the Fleet with the required storage for map data, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and imagery necessary to plan missions. FY 2020 also includes funding to modernize legacy mission planning execution and analysis software for affordable integration with the Next Generation Naval Mission Planning System (NGNMPS).\n\nItems to be funded in this line include:\n\nWorkstation Components - JMPS-M and JMPS-E procure tactical computer hardware through a non-developmental item acquisition strategy. Tactical computer equipment is used to plan and analyze expeditionary missions and aircraft routes under various mission configurations and operational threat environments. Primary outputs are tasking orders, courses of action (COAs), Route Plans, Munitions \/ Weapons Plans, and Navigation and mission essential data loads for mission execution. New workstations consist of aircraft unique data transfer devices and interfaces, Memory Data Loader Receptacles (MDLR) Small Computer Standard Interface (SCSI) (MDLR-S), Electronic Kneeboard (EKB), current and Next Generation Common Munitions Bit Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), Ogden Data Device Ethernet Crypto (ODD-EC), Data Storage Unit Receptacle SCSI (DSUR-S), network hubs, printers, fleet training school workstations, JMPS Application Central Access Library (JACAL), training assets, and other peripheral devices for USN\/USNR\/USMC\/USMCR missions. Next generation CMBRE OPN efforts begin in FY 2021. JMPS Authority to Operate (ATO) requires compliance with Naval Network Warfare Command (NNWC)-issued Information Assurance (IA) mandates and Communications Tasking Orders (CTOs).\n\nSoftware\/Production Engineering Support - The NavMPS program produces software releases via an evolutionary development process. These releases contain enhancements based on fleet inputs and technology challenges. They also contain changes required to retain compatibility with supported platforms, associated weapons, and threat and imagery databases providing input to NavMPS. Software releases are independent of hardware buys. This cost element includes production support services, engineering support services, independent verification and validation test and acceptance, site activation, IA compliance and quality assurance efforts.\n\nIntegrated Logistics Support - The NavMPS program conducts site surveys, prepares site installation drawings and provides on-site engineering and logistics evaluations for installations and delivery systems to ensure compliance with the specified configuration. This includes the production and delivery of technical documentation and training materials such as OPNOTES, installation instructions and user manuals required during the fielding of NavMPS products. ILS is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost."

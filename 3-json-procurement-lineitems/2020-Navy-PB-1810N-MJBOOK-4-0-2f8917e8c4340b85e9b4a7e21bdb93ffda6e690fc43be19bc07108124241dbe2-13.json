Additionally, it will support Large Scale Exercises (LSE) both in CONUS and OCONUS and will enable Fleet trainers to employ an LVC range complex as a resource for units and Strike Groups (SGs) to train and certify for deployment. This is a new Cost Element beginning in FY20.\n\n[P40A \/ AVIATION TRAINING & MISSION REHERSAL SECURITY]: Funding this initiative supports the continuing efforts to create a live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) training environment in support of combat readiness.  Planned LVC capabilities require aviation training in an LVC environment which includes a training environment classified higher than Secret.  Security upgrades to building containing aviation simulators and the Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) are required to operate and train in the higher than Secret environment required to maintain combat readiness.  FY20 funding provides renovation of existing training buildings in ten (10) locations, with remaining three (3) funded in FY21. These security upgrades are necessary to operate and train to the high-end fight in a contested environment without which the LVC 2025 vision cannot be achieved. This is a new Cost Element beginning in FY20.\n\n[P40A \/ TRAINING SUPPORT VESSEL (TSV) PROCUREMENT & SUSTAINMENT]: Training Support Vessels (TSVs) are heavily utilized supporting all major Fleet, Integrated and Advanced phase exercises.  These exercises require TSVs to participate, as well as numerous events supporting both basic \/ advanced phases as well as other units that conduct specifically focused training events.  In 2020, the Jacksonville Shallow Water Training Range (JSWTR) will have a requirement to provide an additional 120 underway days on existing TSVs.  As TSVs enter and leave maintenance phases, there are increasing periods when TSVs are not be available to support directed training exercises.  During those times, Offshore Supply Vessels (OSVs) are leased to ensure the Fleet is trained and certified for deployment.\n\nThe ideal fifth (5th) Training Support Vessel (TSV) would be a nominally 200'-240' Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) with a 140' x 45' open aft deck and a draft of approximately 15'. Similar vessels are currently used by Carrier Strike Group FOUR (CSG4). The TSV will operate day or night, in all-weather, and will operate in support of the Navy's Fleet Training Wholeness (FTW) initiatives and Fleet exercise objectives.\n\nTSVs provide invaluable training assistance to the Fleet in completing the following: Assists in Assessment and Certification of Carrier Strike Groups, Amphibious Readiness Groups\/Marine Expeditionary Units, Surface Action Groups and Independent Deplorers, Atlantic Training Group Basic Phase live fire, Command and Control (C2), HARPOON & High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) missile exercise support, HELLFIRE & Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) missile exercise support, Exercise mine laying and retrieval, Opposition Force roles, Maritime Interdiction\/Visit Board Search and Seizure, Oil Platform Defense, Anti-piracy, Aerial\/Seaborne Target Live Fire Platforms, High Speed Maneuverable Surface Target (HSMST) Launch and Retrieval Platforms, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) training, Unmanned Air System (UAS) Launch and Retrieval Platforms, Global Positioning System (GPS) Testing Operations, Range Services in support of the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP), and other exercise\/support roles as directed.\n\n[P40A \/ TRAINING SUPPORT VESSEL (TSV) COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK SUITE]: An improved communication suite capable of supporting extension of the Navy's East Coast range capabilities and furthering the live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) initiatives underway both on the ranges and inside the combat systems of our ships and aircraft is required.  The Navy's Training Support Vessel (TSV) directly supports the maritime strategy by providing training tailored to real-world missions that deploying strike groups encounter. Each TSV is slated to carry a diverse set of emitters and monitoring equipment to improve the Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW) training capabilities and create the contested littoral environment critical to modern Fleet training. To operate these enhancements in-scenario and provide the required feedback to exercise control and ultimately the training audience; a robust capability is essential.  Sufficient bandwidth, redundancy and flexibility are critical to system performance and successful training.  An updated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber and Intelligence (C5I) suite will provide the Navy's TSVs with the requisite capability to perform Exercise Control (EXCON), Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW), Opposing Forces (OPFOR), Command and Control (C2) duties during fleet exercises, and the ability to fully participate in global distributed modeling and simulation events in an OPFOR role and support multiple events simultaneously. This is a new Cost Element beginning in FY20.\n\n[P40A \/ FIRE ARMS TRAINING SIMULATOR (FATS)]: Funds provide for procurement of shore-based fire arms training simulators at Center for Submarine Learning (CSL) to reduce time and energy expended for small arms proficiency by personnel assigned to small ships and submarines that lack this capability afloat. These un-tethered weapons systems and scenarios place the students into the action and afford them the ability to freely maneuver and handle the weapons.\n\n[P40A \/ YPYTD - TRAINING DELIVERY SERVICES (TDS)]: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Initiative. The training enterprise is moving forward with implementing more efficient technologies to meet the training delivery mission via a virtual desktop infrastructure solution. The virtual desktop solution will be implemented over the next several years at each location in lieu of conducting the traditional one-for-one workstation refresh. The goals and benefits of VDI are to establish an agile, sustainable enterprise training delivery environment; standardize the processes, services and technology used to deliver training; improve the enterprise security posture; refresh outdated electronic classroom workstations and operating systems; and provide a solution that enables a streamlined, centralized IT workforce.\n\n[P40A \/ ECR VDI POOL OF DESKTOPS EQUIP. UPGRADE  (S2025)]: ECR Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Pool of Desktops (POD) Equipment Upgrade - VDI 2.0 for RRL Requirements (Includes Storage, Rack Infrastructure and Backup\/System Management Software).

Note:  Unit cost for VDI 2.0 POD is only marginally different than non-RRL POD cost - just a slightly different configuration.\n\n[P40A \/ ECR Instructor Podium Tech Refresh]: The Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) Electronic Classroom (ECR) Program provides support for classroom and distributive learning environments in 2,500 classrooms at 68 learning sites around the world.  The ECR Program requires OPN funds over the FYDP to replace end-of-life networking equipment, and to purchase VDI Electronic Classroom workstations, VDI ECR Pool of Desktops (POD) equipment and software in support of training delivery operation across the enterprise.\n\n[P40A \/ ECR Student Workstation Tech Refresh]: The NETC ECR Program provides support for classroom and distributive learning environments in 2,500 classrooms at 68 learning sites around the world.  To meet DoD\/DoN IT virtualization mandates, NETC is implementing a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solution that largely eliminates physical workstations in classrooms.  Under VDI, students utilize \"zero client desktop devices \" which provide a user experience similar to physical workstations, without the use of CPU, local storage or Operating Systems.  Zero clients take up less space, use less power and give off less heat.  No data is stored on classroom zero clients, reducing the amount of local security and compliance work required.  Additionally, zero clients are less complex for the NETC IT Support staff to configure, deploy and manage, enabling centralization\/consolidation of labor functions.  Students access virtualized curriculum software which is run on centralized servers known as Pools of Desktops (PODs).  Software patches and security scans can be performed at the server level, as effort is no longer required to handle those same functions on thousands of student seats.  In addition to saving electrical power, VDI allows learning site managers to optimize facility utilization by shifting classes to other rooms if necessary since students and instructors are not tied to specific local hardware.  \n\nThe ECR Program requires OPN funds over the FYDP to replace end-of-life networking equipment, and to purchase VDI Electronic Classroom workstations, VDI ECR POD equipment and software in support of training delivery operation across the enterprise.  \n\nPool of Desktops (POD) resources used to upgrade\/buy equipment vice Tech Refresh here in FY18 and FY19. Also, CISCO servers being replaced in FY19 and FY20.\n\n[P40A \/ ECR VDI IMPLEMENTATION (VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE)]: ECR VDI Implementation (Virtualization Software).\n\n[P40A \/ CANES Acceleration]: Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES)]: CANES is a new program beginning in FY 2021.

These include: Simulated Surface OPFOR, Electronic Warfare Projection, Training Target Operations, Jacksonville Shallow Water Training Range (JSWTR), and support requirements for day-and-night and all-weather operations supporting the Navy's Fleet Training Wholeness (FTW) initiative. The fifth (5th) TSV will address training capacity gaps due to routine maintenance, required dry-dock periods, and decreasing availability of leased training vessels, as well as increased demand for TSV-provided services for sophisticated OPFOR characteristics, more complex target presentations, and an increasing requirement to meet LVC training objectives.",

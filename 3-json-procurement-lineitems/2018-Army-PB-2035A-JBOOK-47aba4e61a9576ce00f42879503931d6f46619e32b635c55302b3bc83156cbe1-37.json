            "val": "This line covers both the T9 Medium Tractor, Full Tracked and the T5 Light Tractor, Full Tracked. These Bulldozers are used to perform dozing, rough grading, cutting and filling, and ripping in support of general engineer construction tasks; to build and maintain roads and airfields; and to build and support tactical missions. When equipped with armor protection, they fulfill the military requirements for mine clearing and military specific operations in a hostile environment. These Bulldozers are equipped with a power shift transmission and hydraulically operated semi-U type Bulldozer blade.  The Bulldozers have either a winch or a ripper.  Due to the low ground bearing pressure, the Bulldozer possesses the capability to work in adverse underfoot conditions and is normally one of the first pieces of construction equipment on a job site. The T9 Medium Tractor, Full Tracked is a low speed, medium draw bar pull bulldozer with a blade and is a basic item of earthmoving equipment used for heavy dozing and clearing.  The T5 Light Tractor, Full Tracked is a smaller, air mobile, air droppable Bulldozer used in airborne operations for construction and maintenance emplacements, roads and airfields. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 1,600 (T-9: 1,296\/T-5: 304), in addition, the Armor Kit requirement is 366 ( T-9: 318\/T-5: 48).  This is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) program."

            "val": "* Indian Financing is listed as P-1 line number 46-1 because it is not showing on the P-1 and falls under WHS.  \n\nThe FY 2017 approved conference report did not include language in support of funding of $15.000 million for Indian Finance.  Prior approval reprograming FY17-20 PA for Indian Financing Act did not transfer in the accounting system prior to lock for the end of the FY 2017 actuals, however funds have been received and are executing in FY 2018.  The DOD Indian Incentive Program (IIP) is authorized by Section 504 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (U.S.C 1544).  In 1989, Congress began providing annual funds through the DOD Appropriation Act for the DOD Indian Incentive Program.  The program motivates prime contractors to utilize Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises by providing a 5% rebate on subcontracted work performed by those companies that fall into the following categories:  Federally Recognized American Indian Organizations, Indian-Owned economics enterprises and small businesses owned by members of recognized tribes, Alaskan Natives or Native Hawaiians.  Through the generation of subcontracts to the above mentioned entities, the IIP fulfills its purpose as an economic multiplier for Native American communities."

            "val": "The FY 2017 approved conference report did not include language in support of funding of $15.000 million for Indian Finance.  Approval for reprogram of the Indian Financing Act was delayed therefore the impact for duty was delayed, however funds have been received and are executing in FY 2018.  The Office of Small Business Programs did not process rebate requests in 2017 to contractors for utilizing Native American firms.  However, it plans to process between 120 and 150 rebate requests in 2018."

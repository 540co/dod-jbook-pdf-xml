            "val": "This line provides for new and systematic replacement of investment items required in support of the operational mission of the Navy's claimancy.  Procurement of Command Support Equipment throughout the Navy involves the purchase, replacement and upgrade of various pieces of equipment such as Cable Replacements and the purchase, repair, and upgrade of IT Infrastructure and Security Systems.  This equipment is an integral part of the programs to improve the fleet and shore establishment by maintaining or expanding existing capabilities or replacing ineffective units.\n\n[P40A \/ NCIS Data Modernization & Analytical Tools]: The NCIS mission is to support the day-to-day operations to Prevent Terrorism, Protection of National Secrets, Reduce Crime across the Department of Navy and Marine Corps, and comply with DON Mandates. Without the IT Program and Technical Support, these systems will impact NCIS ability to fulfill its mission as designated by SECNAVINST 5430.107. This will Negatively impact mission commanders in their warfighting capacity. Additionally, these IT services have a direct impact on security and monitoring of IT systems as defined in DOD 8500.02 and would violate the requirement and raise the risk of system security vulnerabilities. In addition, NCIS will be supporting the Naval Justice Information System (NJIS), Tactical Network, and VTC infrastructure initiatives.\n\n[P40A \/ OCHR - Human Resource IT system]: Procurement funding ensures that production and modernization of Human Resources Civilian Personnel (HRCP) in support of DON HR Enterprise Systems remain in accordance with DOD and DON modernization efforts are met, technical refresh of past-shelf-life infrastructure supporting HRCP, and planned HRLINK licensing expansion in compliance to ESL mandates to DON Functional Communities.\n   \nRoutine Technical Refresh -  $116K\nLicensing - IBM\/ESL Contract via ImmixTechnology   $325K\n\n[P40A \/ FIP]: Funding will be used for procurement of additional modules\/ capabilities to improve Navy ERP user experience and actions to correct deficiencies found in the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) audit. FISCAM resourcing requirements are growing as an increasing number of deficiencies are identified due to non-compliance with financial audit standards resulting from inadequate internal controls among DON business processes and IT systems.\n\n[P40A \/ Insider Threat]: The Navy Insider Threat program seeks to meet Defense and Department of the Navy direction to deter, detect, and mitigate the risk of compromise due to insider threats. Insider Threat to Cybersecurity will enable accomplishment of these objectives by providing a user activity monitoring capability, a mechanism for fusing collected information with security risk data from multiple other sources, and a graphical display to facilitate threat analysis, identification, and initial action. This effort is to procure, configure, and install hardware and software in support of the Insider Threat program.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS)]: Electronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS):  \n\nElectronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS) is an electronic document\/image based system that serves as the repository for all Department of Navy (DoN) official military personnel record images (over 170 million images).  It supports retired, active, and reserve military personnel in the functional areas of selection board operations, casualty management, mobilization, veteran benefits (providing automated Sailor information to the Veterans Administration) and other military personnel management functions.  EMPRS annually supports over 150 statutory and administrative selection boards, providing over 12 million service record images, covering promotions, assignments, and retention. References: Title 10 & 44, U. S. Code and Title 36, CFR (Record Management Requirements), DoD Directive 5015.2 \n\nOPN funding provided allows us to use an acquisition strategy that is both cost efficient and effective.  This strategy sustains the EMPRS program throughout the FYDP, providing technology refreshment (TR) throughout the years (evolutionary) as opposed to a TR every 8 years.  This provides vital upgrades in a more timely manner.  An 8 year refresh cycle of IT would require reliance on old system and software, by IT standards, that frequently result in compatibility issues as new systems and software are fielded, thus driving up sustainment costs.  Evolutionary technical refreshment is a more cost effective strategy.\n\n[P40A \/ Peripherals]: :  Peripherals represent auxiliary and infrastructure components that make up and are associated with the EMPRS system, which supports the Navy's selection board processes for all Officer and senior enlisted personnel (E7 & above).  EMPRS is the major information system which is mutually supported by infrastructure to conduct 160 selection boards on an annual basis.  Peripherals include items such as removable walls within boardrooms that function as display screen for military personnel record display, keyboards, printers, monitors, mice for workstations in the boardrooms, etc.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Security System (ESS) Replacement\/Upgrade]: Electronic Security System (ESS) Replacement\/Upgrade\nAn integrated, open-architecture, non-proprietary digital replacement and\/or upgraded corrections\/detention-grade electronic security management system. Purchases to include but not limited to: New infrastructure; Multiple CCTV camera monitoring; On-line recording systems; Redundant server\/workstation\/client fail-over capabilities; VOIP Intercommunication & Paging Audio System; CCTV state-of-the-art, solid state, IP (Internet Protocol) cameras; NVR Recording System Network Video Recorders (NVRs); Integration of CCTV systems to other Brig sub-systems; Access Control System; Proximity-type cards and contactless readers; Integration of the access control system and other facility security control subsystems; Radio Frequency Identification Tracking System; Personal Duress and Alarm System; Personal Digital\/Detention Assistant for staff with 802.11 Wi-Fi connectivity; and other requirements necessary to replace\/upgrade to a fully functional and integrated Electronic Security System.\n\n[P40A \/ System - Crisis Announcement]: The U.S. Naval War College (NWC) requires a distributed control crisis mass emergency real time assisted voice evacuation and mass communication system within the NWC complex to comply with published safety standards.  The required installation will enable NWC security and leadership personnel to operate a supervised and distributed, integrated compound wide system of emergency response.  This system will provide an announcement system for the College to mitigate additional emergency situations such as active shooter, bomb threats and other threat scenarios.   The required system would assist in the protection of life and property by indicating the existence of an emergency situation and providing \"real time\" instructions to a large number of people whether inside a building or spread out the NWC complex and surrounding area on Newport Naval Station.   As a host of International Senior Officers and numerous U.S. dignitaries, both military and civilian, the Naval War College lacks to capability coordinate the responses of the 1,500 personnel on campus.\n\n[P40A \/ Converged ERP]: Converged Enterprise Resource Planning:   The Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution is an integrated business management system that modernizes and standardizes Navy's business processes.  Navy ERP utilizes best commercial practices to provide real-time information exchange, unprecedented financial and asset visibility, and improved reporting and decision-making capabilities across key acquisition, financial, and logistics operations.\n \nNavy ERP is the tool chosen to meet Congressional mandates to establish and maintain federal financially compliant management systems, federal accounting standards, and U.S. Government General Ledger procedures at the transaction level.  The Navy ERP foundation to achieve enterprise-wide business transformation is accomplished through two releases:  the Financial\/Acquisition Solution and the Single Supply Solution.  \n \nThe Navy has overcome a broad range of challenges to successfully deploy financial, acquisition, and workforce management capabilities to all the major acquisition Systems Commands, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and Strategic Systems Programs (SSP).  These commands include up to 72,000 users and $69B of the Navy's Total Obligation Authority (TOA).  Navy ERP has deployed and stabilized the Single Supply Solution covering all Navy's Material Groups and Fleet Logistic Centers (FLCs) and Partner Sites. \n \nThe project acquires standard applications servers (ADP hardware) which are hosted in a Navy Data Center at NAS Patuxent River to support ERP software for the Navy Converged ERP Program.  Funding reflects procurement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hardware, software, and licenses in support of the SAP enterprise system environment for the Navy ERP Program.\n\n[P40A \/ Ashore Equipment]: NSIPS is the Navy's world-wide system for the field level input of pay and personnel transactions.  NSIPS supports active duty and reserve users ashore through a single web site, and on approximately 125 ships. NSIPS collects, validates, processes and transfers the data necessary to ensure accurate and timely pay and maintenance of personnel records.\n\nNSIPS is a modern, cost-effective human resources capability that fully integrates business processes, tools, and authoritative data to efficiently and effectively manage the military workforce. NSIPS is being enhanced to systematically modernize the Navy's pay and personnel processes and systems. NSIPS relies on technical refresh to maintain the usability, functionality and supportability of the systems ashore to avoid technical obsolescence.  The technical refresh of ashore equipment (hardware and software) will be performed on an annual basis throughout the FYDP.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Procurement System (ePS)]: ELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS):\nThe electronic Procurement System (ePS) is the Department of the Navy's (DON) End-to-End (E2E) Contract Writing System (CWS).  It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with a full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  The ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability.  The ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.\n\nFull deployment of the ePS ensures compliance of the DON's contracting abilities with the following legislative mandates: the writing and management of all contracts must now occur in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); the central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) Section 2222); and all contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 & Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).   \n\nThe ePS will use DoD data exchange capabilities (e.g.; Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Purchase Request Data Standard (PRDS)) in order to achieve standardized data interoperability with external systems.  The Navy Enterprise Service Bus (NESB) serves as the hub to relay procurement data to various finance and other systems of record, such as Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (NERP), Standard Accounting & Reporting System (STARS) and Standard Accounting Budgeting & Reporting System (SABRS). \n\nThe result of successful ePS implementation will be a contracting workforce that issues accurate and timely contracts in a standard format that comply with all DoD\/Federal laws, regulations, and policies.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Procurement System (ePS)]: ELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS):\nThe electronic Procurement System (ePS) is the Department of the Navy's (DON) End-to-End (E2E) Contract Writing System (CWS).  It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability. ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.\n\nFull deployment of the ePS ensures DON's compliance with the following legislative mandates: writing and management of all contracts in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) Section 2222); and contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 & Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).\n\n[P40A \/ Maritime Operations Center (MOC) Procurement]: MOCs deliver Navy Command and Control (C2) capabilities at the Operational Level of War (OLW)  that guide execution of the six (6) core capabilities of the Navy as outlined in the 2009 A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower (Forward Presence, Deterrence, Sea Control, Power Projection, Maritime Security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response) through the full range of military operations (ROMO).  The MOC initiative focuses on improving the Navy's OLW C2 by establishing baseline capabilities in globally-networked MOCs enabling Numbered Fleet and Navy Component Commanders (NFC\/NCC) to assume a range of Service and Joint roles while continuing to accomplish traditional Fleet management functions.  The MOC construct enhances C2 of Navy forces at the operational level through headquarters manned by individuals qualified in joint operational-level staff processes and enabled by globally interoperable Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.  MOCs provide organizational consistency, the scalability and flexibility to transition between various command roles, and enhanced global networking among Navy and Joint organizations.  The desired end state\/goal of the system-of-systems methodology embodied in each of the eight (8) MOCs is to achieve globally-networked operational-level C2 decisions by NCC, Joint Force Maritime Component Commanders (JFMCC) and Commanders of Joint Task Forces (CJTF).  Focused acquisition of standard and common suites of systems (from the existing base of Navy, Army, Air Force and joint Programs of Record (PORs) and non-PORs) facilitates successful accomplishment of designated Joint Mission-Essential Tasks (JMETS) aligned to Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) and in support of Combatant Commander theater objectives.\n\nThis system of systems approach aims to achieve effective, agile, networked and scalable MOCs, employing common doctrine, standardized processes and common C4I systems.  Each MOC will be able to operate within a common organizational construct in various roles (joint, interagency and combined).  The global network and commonality enable both reach-back and load-sharing across all MOCs within a Navy enterprise network to include Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) networks.  The eight (8) MOCs consist of nine (9) sites (seven (7) ashore and two (2) afloat) including each of the numbered Fleets (Commander Third Fleet (C3F); Commander Fourth Fleet (C4F); Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F); Commander Sixth Fleet (C6F) ashore and forward afloat; Commander Seventh Fleet (C7F); Commander Tenth Fleet (C10F); Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT); and U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) NCCs.\n\n[P40A \/ CNIC]: Smart Grid System provides the ability to centrally monitor, manage, and control energy supply and distribution as well as helps to sustain lower cost of shore operations gained through identification and execution of energy efficiency projects. To attain the Navy's Shore Energy Security Goals, funding will be used to support the procurement of the software and equipment suite to connect advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with building energy controls across various Navy installations via a secure IT network connection.\n\nThis procurement provides full capability consisting of hardware, software, integration, & operator training necessary to aggregate data from thousands of disparate control systems into a centralized and secure data management system. It provides the operator(s) transparency of the operational condition of building and utility infrastructure and includes advanced analytics that enable timely action for preventive maintenance, prevention of disruption in operations and support of condition based maintenance, supporting mission assurance and bringing further operational savings.

Project will allow consolidation of administrative, personnel and operational support functions into a new facility and subsequent demolition of eleven old and deteriorated buildings.\n\n[P40A \/ BCO Infrastructure Replacement (Cable & Equipment)]: In FY18 the following work efforts will be performed (BSO 60): Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station Far East (NCTSFE) requires Fiber Optic Backbone Realignment on Fleet Activities Yokosuka. BLII engineering and installation did not ensure nor provide for redundancy in case of meteorological, geological, or intentional service interruption. Out-side plant Fiber has been installed by many different efforts with no logical hierarchy and no redundancy to the critical C2 nodes as there are actually five separate fiber optical backbones that do not connect. Current optical backbone infrastructure will not support Assured Services LAN (ASLAN) in accordance with DOD Unified Capability Requirements (DOD UCR 2008) allowing converged distribution of  voice, video and data services to include redundancy and diversity of critical C2 and special C2 infrastructure. This results in C2 buildings being single-threaded and at great risk of potential loss of service in a catastrophic event. Key users who will lose connectivity include the NATIONAL COMMAND AUTHORITIES, Combatant Commanders of the Unified Commands, and strategic and tactical subordinate commanders.\nAdditional cost in FY17 and FY18 are due to new\/upgraded Base Communication Office (BCO) Outside cable plant infrastructure upgrades required to comply with Unified Capabilities (UC) specifications IAW DoDI 8100.04. Unified Capabilities are the integration of voice, video, and\/or data services delivered ubiquitously across a secure and highly available infrastructure, independent of technology, to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter and business communities.\n\n[P40A \/ Electrical Power Systems]: FY18 Procurement Plan Electrical Power (BSO 60):  Replacing satellite communications (SATCOM) power control panels at the NAVSATCOMFAC in Wahiawa, Hawaii.

            "val": "NCIS Data Modernization & Analytical Tools\n\nIncrease in funding supports components of NCIS' NJIS Scanning, Tactical Network and VTC infrastructure initiatives.  As the DON begins the roll-out of NJIS, NCIS has a requirement to deploy a variety of high speed scanning capabilities across the enterprise to capture investigative data. NCIS is under development to host critical investigative and operational capabilities which will provide a secure and private environment that allows the investigative technical components of the organization to conduct their mission more efficiently. A number of investigative tools and techniques will leverage this tactical network to include Investigative Cyber Security; Technical Services; Cyber, Technical Surveillance Counter Measures (TSCM), Tech Services, Bio-Metrics, etc. Currently, these capabilities are scattered across separate networks and are not integrated or available to the agency as a whole. Furthermore, NCIS' conference rooms and Leadership Desktop Units are reaching end-of-life and replacement of these systems will give NCIS the capabilities to securely communicate about ongoing investigative and operational sensitive cases to support mission requirements. \n\nOffice of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR):  Human Resources IT System\n\nOffice of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR) provides information technology system support for over 204,000 civilians at more than 1,340 naval activities throughout the world.  These systems are the core of human resource support for the Department of the Navy.  The OCHR Systems Division has the responsibility to implement, sustain, and support the hardware, software, systems and applications, functional administration, and communications infrastructure in accordance with the Department of Navy Chief Information Office, Naval Network Warfare Command, Navy Marine Corp Intranet, and DOD Civilian Personnel Management Services mandates, directives, and policies. The technology for the myriad of human resource applications requires upgrades and\/or additional capability to support and maintain the integrity of these systems cost effectively.\n\nDON Financial Improvement Program (FIP) -- formed in response to Congressional mandates for Navy-Marine Corps and the rest of the Defense Department to achieve financial auditability.  The FIP is a Department-wide multi-year change management effort which requires fundamental improvements to processes and systems as well as to the business culture to implement those strengthened internal controls.  Increase in FY18 will be used for the STARS to SABRS (S2S) transition hardware and software (HW\/SW) required for supporting DON SABRS\/SMARTS. This funding begins to address the many HW\/SW requirements to transition the 11 BSOs migrating over to SABRS.   Implementation will allow DON to comply with OSD's Financial Management (FM) Functional Strategy, to (1) simplify the financial management environment; (2) make the environment more efficient; and, (3) generate auditable budget and accounting data.\n\nInsider Threat \nFunds were transferred from MIP OPN LI 8114.  This effort is to procure, configure, and install hardware and software in support of the Insider Threat program.\n\nEMPRS -- Increase from FY17 to FY18 funds critical workstation tech refreshes previously deferred.\n\nConverged Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): FY18 funds provide technical refresh of hardware\/servers at the Navy Data Center at NAS Patuxent River.\n \nNSIPS\nIn FY18 NSIPS will purchase ashore equipment (hardware and software) to provide the additional capacity and capabilities required by personnel modernization, and to meet Information Assurance requirements.  Funds will be used to procure servers, CAC verification and load balancing devices, computer storage, and associated software for the NSIPS web ashore development, test, production, and COOP environments.  Hardware purchases will be through NGEN contract which includes installation costs. \n\nThe increase in NSIPS in FY18 is to procure licenses to improve productivity and reduce future development and sustainment cost of added back office functionality. Additional licenses are required to increase Cyber Security and add necessary security modules limiting Information Assurance (IA) vulnerabilities.  These licenses are needed to improve system security, improve auditability, reduce the amount of PeopleCode required for development and sustainment of additional functionality, support the expanded usage from the system consolidations, and improve overall performance of the system.\n\nELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS): FY18 funding is for the procurement of user licenses for the limited deployment of ePS. \n\nCNIC: SMARTGRID\n\nSmart Grid Energy Management Computer Software Suite Description: Smart Grid is a new building and utility energy management capability comprised of a computer software suite that through daily operations brings significant savings from predictive maintenance and efficient management of energy sources across the Navy's 70 CONUS and OCONUS installations. The Smart Grid provides first time capability to intelligently analyze energy data from 16,849 smart meters previously installed to comply with the Energy Policy Act 2005 (Public Law 109-58-August 8, 2005) and the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 (Public Law 110-140-December 19, 2007. The Smart Grid aggregates meter data with highest energy consuming 2042 buildings and 174 utility control systems to intelligently and continuously identify cost savings opportunities, providing 2 of the 8 Trillion BTU energy savings needed to achieve the 50% Navy energy reduction target. The Smart Grid brings first time transparency of building and utility system operations and behavior, essential to both monitor for, and react to, a cyber-event.\n\nMaritime Operations Center (MOC): The FY 2018 funding will provide for procurement, production engineering, integration and installations required to continue incremental improvements of the common capabilities of the MOCs, leading to fully-integrated, globally-networked operational-level commands with a Navy enterprise network and appropriate capabilities to exercise Command and Control (C2) over Navy missions, such as Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), in accordance with MOC baseline requirements.\n\nBCO Infrastructure: FY18 increase is to support infrastructure upgrades, Fiber and copper, in the Far East Region and represents a fraction of the BCO OPN requirements.  This antiquated cable plant needs to be replaced due to hazardous material and are not compliant with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1025 or 29CFR 1926.62. The outside cable plant at Navy facilities is antiquated, resulting in significant and frequent failures due to deterioration of cabling insulation. The failure rate is accelerating which is causing prolonged system outages.\n\nDeployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS)\n\nPer USCYBERCOM System Requirements Document, each CPT must be provisioned with 2 Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) to support two simultaneous team deployments (40 total). The CPTs primary mission is to Survey, Secure, and Protect military networks (aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide) which necessitates onsite vulnerability assessments and incident response on little to no notice.  Field deployable computing assets for the 20 Navy CPTs are required to allow deployable teams to conduct intensive, computationally-heavy analysis when reach-back capability is unavailable or bandwidth is limited.  In addition, Navy CPTs located in CONUS will be required to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into theater to support C4F, C5F, and C6F mission assurance objectives to include identification of cyber key terrain and OPLAN development.\n\nOCO: \nMaritime Operations Center (MOC) Server Room \n\nMOC C2 Server Room Relocation is needed now to correct material and safety hazards. MOC C2 Server Room was designed using 1990's technologies, safety and physical security practices. COMUSNAVCENT recognized many deficiencies and safety hazards and funded SSCLANT $3.2M in FY15 to provide design and engineering services to determine requirements to correct safety hazards and relocate the current MOC C2 Server Room and all systems to another location. The current MOC C2 Server Room presents several risks to life, mission, and cybersecurity. Critical issues needing immediate correction are replacement of wet fire suppression with dry system, replacing cabinets\/racks with hot-aisle containment system to improve cooling and physical security, and replace rack power distribution to overhead vice below floor to eliminate shock hazard in case of wet fire suppression discharge.   If not funded with OCO funds, C5F  MOC, and Coalition forces will not be able to provide timely and effective Command and Control decisions necessary in the pursuit of US, and Coalition, Strategic Objectives within the CENTCOM Theatre \n\nBriefing Display System \n\nAn approved FY17 upgrade of BDS did not properly take into consideration scope growth of the project needed to replace or upgrade all end-of-life components or technology inflation. The U.S. Naval Forces Central Command's (NAVCENT) Briefing Display System (BDS) is the primary battlespace awareness tool used by the Combined Maritime Forces US and Coalition Watch Team as well as NAVCENT leadership Command and Control. BDS is a multifaceted Video Information System providing battlespace awareness video to the Combined Maritime Operation Center (CMOC), Alternate Maritime Operations Center (AMOC), War Room, Flag\/Coalition Command Suite, Department Head offices, conference rooms and key coalition leadership. BDS is essential to US and Coalition leadership command and control of all naval forces in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.  Current BDS suite is beyond end-of-life with necessary repairs to critical components like VTC and the \"Knowledge Wall\" made all the more expensive due to their obsolescence.   As a result, a proposed rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for this upgrade fell short of completing all needed work.  The BDS fund is a supplemental follow on from the approved project in PB17.  Loss of any of these feeds would severely hamper the mission of COMUSNNAVCENT and Coalition Partners to direct operations in the CENTCOM AOR.  \n\nNavy Enterprise Tactical Command and Control (NETC2) \n\nNETC2 is required to provide cyber compliant COOP capability.  JMAST in COMUSNAVENCT's current Command and Control (C2) systems COOP site; it is scheduled to be decommissioned as of 30SEP2016 with no replacement identified.  JMAST is antiquated (beyond end-of-life) and cannot be made Information assurance (IA) compliant in its current state.  Moreover, JMAST is comprised of legacy equipment that is no longer supported by the POR.  Only 1 NETC2 is required.  Further discussions with PMW 790 after UFR submitted indicated that one unit can scale to meet NAVCENT requirements with additional cost.  Cost of $2.5M is for 50 seats.  NAVCENT requires 100 seats therefore; requested funding level remains at $5M to support capacity and capability of the COOP requirement.  Failure to fund the NETC2 procurement with OCO funding results in dramatically increased unfunded requirement to be potentially filled with Operation and Management costs (estimated to be over $2Million per annum) as COMUSNAVCENT will be required to maintain all existing JMAST equipment and personnel organically."

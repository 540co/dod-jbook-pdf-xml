            "val": "Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nDEAMS user deployments include:\n- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)\n- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome\n- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)\n- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan\n- U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and Joint Base San Antonio\n- Air Force Material Command (AFMC), and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) \n- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs\n\nOn 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increments. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Increment (Inc) 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Authority to Proceed (FD ATP) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. FD ATP date is August 2020 and Capability Support Authority to Proceed (CS ATP) date is February 2021.  \n\nDEAMS was designated as an Agile Pilot program in the FY19 NDAA.\n\nDEAMS will require software user licenses to support system deployments as well as potential software and hardware requirements needed to manage, execute, and deliver DEAMS system capability including necessary system upgrades. \n\nThis requirement (or modification) supports performance of a full financial audit as required by title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 9A, Sec 240-D.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver DEAMS system capability.\n\nProcurement funding prior to FY19 for DEAMS was in PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development (FMISD). Funding for this exhibit contained in PE0901554F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction\nto each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

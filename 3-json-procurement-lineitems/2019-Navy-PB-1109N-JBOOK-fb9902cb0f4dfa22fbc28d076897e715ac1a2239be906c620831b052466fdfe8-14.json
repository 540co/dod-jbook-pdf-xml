            "val": "The Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS) can collect and store biometric information, to include fingerprints, iris scans and facial images and is able to \"match\" personnel whose biometrics correspond to a record of stored data. Information from networked BAT-Clients is sent to BAT-Servers. The BAT-Servers update other BAT-Servers and provide information to the biometrics intelligence process for further analysis. Funding supports the hardware reset and technical refresh of the Family of Systems Biometrics equipment. The refresh will address hardware technology obsolescence, along with software updates to meet Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS) compliance. Biometric identification has become a key capability in counter insurgency warfare in support of ongoing contingency operations. Without this critical capability, the Marine Corps loses the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities.\n\nIdentity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC) is a multi-modal (fingerprint, iris and face) biometric collection system that provides the United States Marine Corps (USMC) a reliable and effective capability to collect, share, match, access, verify, and store identity information. IDS-MC will enable the Marine to collect appropriate biometric, biographical and reference information on an individual and match this locally developed information with pre-existing information available to the expeditionary force. The system will display match results with linkage to the respective individual's biographical and reference information as well as help to analyze the response, update records as appropriate, create reports, and disseminate updated information in accordance with current Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) policy. The primary mission of IDS-MC is to provide the MAGTF with the means to identify persons encountered in the battlespace. While IDS-MC is not an intelligence analysis system, it does provide identification information in support of military intelligence and law enforcement operations by providing positive identification of persons of interest. IDS-MC is an enabler in the areas of detainee management and questioning, base access, counterintelligence screening, border control, law enforcement, displaced persons' management and aiding in humanitarian assistance missions. IDS-MC supports the tactical application of identity dominance and fully supports a forward presence, crisis response and contingency response capability. IDS will subsume the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). The total AAO of 804 is required for training facilities and eleven battalion-sized elements. Prior to FY2019, IDS-MC had funding in BLI 6438, Physical Security Equipment.\n\nExpeditionary Forensic Exploitation Capability (EFEC) is a portable, expeditionary laboratory capable of conducting Level I and II forensics analysis of captured enemy material, evidence and information. It is comprised of 4 Table of Authorized Material Control Numbers (TAMCN), which include Chemical, Media, and Site Exploitation, and a Laboratory kit."

            "val": "Beginning in FY19, IDS-MC funding has been realigned from BLI 6438, PHYSICAL SECURITY EQUIPMENT to BLI 4652, MODIFICATION KITS.\n\nFY2018 Base Appropriation Request: N\/A\n\nFY2019 Base Appropriation Request: $0.971M\n\nIdentity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC): $0.971M to initiate procurement of the hardware and software for IDS-MC Increment 2 in accordance with a MS C\/LRIP procurement decision. FY19 increase is due to realignment from BLI 6438 to 4652. Realignment of effort to new BLI in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR.\n\nOCO: \nFY2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request:  $0.750M\n\nExpeditionary Forensic Exploitation Capability (EFEC) will procure hardware for replacement of legacy obsolete IT equipment and other peripherals such as Sabre 5000 Handheld Trace Detectors for explosives, chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals and narcotics.  Forensics Exploitation has become a key capability in counter insurgency (COIN) warfare.  This system provides the Marine Corps the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities identified in COCOM CONOPS, CONPLANS\/OPLANS, and Theater Campaign Plans in support of the Joint Force requirement."

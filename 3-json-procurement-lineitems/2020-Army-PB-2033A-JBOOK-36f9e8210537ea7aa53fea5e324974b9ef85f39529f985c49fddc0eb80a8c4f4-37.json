Funding will also purchase Non-Standard weapons to support the Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF) as well as world class Olympic Grade marksmanship weapons and accessories to support the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and Army National Guard to include Biathlon Teams to maintain and procure the specialized target rifles, pistols and accessories:  Air Rifles, 22 caliber Pistols and Rifles, Shooting glasses and scopes, Free Pistols, Shot Guns and bolt action rifles."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2020 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.066 million supports the Active Army by providing funding for the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and National Guard Biathlon Teams.  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis.  The man\/weapon interface at this competitive level is important.   Between competitions the AMU fires constantly to hone their skills and maintain their competitive edge.  Weapons of all types are fired, and even with the extremely high level of maintenance provided, these weapons exceed their stated effective life projections faster.  This requires the weapons to be coded out and replaced regularly. Base funding will also provide for the procurement and training of various Non-Standard Weapons to support the regionally engaged Active Army.  These weapons are required to facilitate training of US Army units on host nation weapon systems prior to deployment in support of regionally aligned force missions.  The Army will procure Biathlon Rifles for the Army National Guard Biathlon Teams.  Supports senior commanders and key personnel as High Risk Personnel (HRP).  HPRs are authorized a Personal Security Detail (PSD), which are assigned to guard against outlined threats.  To address this operational need, PSD military personnel require weapons with greater lethality than pistols that are more concealable than rifles.  The ultimate objective of this program is to acquire a highly concealable Sub Compact Weapon (SCW) system capable of engaging threat personnel with a high volume of lethal force while accurately firing at close range with minimal collateral damage.  The Army will procure 350 SCW systems for PSD.  Also procures small caliber rifles for the law enforcement program to control wildlife on Army Posts.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

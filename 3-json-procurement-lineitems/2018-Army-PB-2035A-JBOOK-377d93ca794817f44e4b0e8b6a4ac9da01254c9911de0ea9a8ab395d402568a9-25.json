        "Description": {
            "val": "The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) provides Soldiers with advanced active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing (from harmful Impulse and Steady-State Noises), while enabling situational awareness (e.g., enhanced ability to detect sounds) and mission command (e.g., voice communications over a tactical radio).  TCAPS enhances survivability and situational awareness by protecting Soldiers from noise induced hearing loss.  Soldiers wearing TCAPS are provided hearing protection capable of amplifying faint sounds that under normal circumstance would not be audible or intelligible with the naked ear and the ability to detect the direction of the sound.\n\nTCAPS employs Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated on a periodic basis, in order to validate performance requirements and Soldier acceptance. The best commercial solution(s) evaluated are transitioned into sustainment and fielding. TCAPS hearing protection contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. To accommodate existing situations for Soldiers not assigned a tactical radio, the TCAPS Program includes TCAPS-Lite providing hearing protection and situational awareness for soldiers that do not require connectivity to a tactical radio for radio communications.\n\nTCAPS Approved Acquisition Objective is 106,184."

            "val": "FY 2018 procurement dollars in the amount of $4.411 million procures commercial-off-the-shelf Tactical Communications and Protective Systems for up to one (1) IBCT and associated fielding.\n\nThe General Accounting Office (GAO) Report 11-114 states that the Veterans Administration purchased 382,000 hearing assistive devices at an estimated expenditure of $154 million in FY2008 and provided annual disability payments in excess of $1.1 billion in FY2009. Hearing injuries will be avoided only if Soldiers wear hearing protection. Historically Soldiers have had to choose between hearing protection and auditory situational awareness, TCAPS eliminates the need to make a choice by providing both along with enabling command, control and situational awareness.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

            "val": "The Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Systems P-1 line provides funds for procurement of shipboard terminal equipment for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and ship-to-aircraft tactical communications via earth orbiting relay satellites.   This includes Radio Frequency (RF) equipment and baseband equipment assembled and grouped into systems and subsystems structured to address specific naval communications requirements. These systems provide modem processors and peripheral equipment that control the RF links for message traffic, direct data transfer and secure voice communications.  They are selected and oriented by communications traffic levels, types of communications and operational missions. Technical refresh of system modems will directly support Assured Command and Control (C2) posture, SATCOM reliability, space resiliency via band diversity and redundancy.\n\n[P3A \/ (NR117) Global Broadcast Service (GBS)]: GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE (GBS - NR117): GBS is a Joint Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) program with the Air Force as Executive Agent for all services. GBS provides a continuous, high speed, one way information flow of high volume data to units ashore, afloat or special operations. GBS supports routine operations, training and military exercises, special activities, crises, situational awareness, weapons targeting, reconnaissance and the transition to and conduct of opposed operations short of nuclear war. Deployment of GBS internet protocol (IP) terminals will allow expanded use of military intelligence collection in a broader spectrum using MILSATCOM architecture. The Navy GBS Split IP effort enables near-real-time duplex asymmetric communications connectivity to ships\/subs. GBS plays a pivotal role in an Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) scenario.\n\n[P3A - 2 \/ (NR112) Commercial Broadband Satellite program (CBSP) - Afloat]: The Navy's next generation Commercial Satellite Communications (SATCOM) program provides the only source of wideband SATCOM to Patrol Coastal (PCs) and Mine Countermeasure Ships (MCMs), diversity for MILSATCOM on Unit Level Variant (ULV) ships, and augments MILSATCOM on Force Level Variant (FLV) ships. CBSP will support the procurement and installation of a commercial terminal and service architecture that significantly increase data throughput, Navy Anti-Access Area Denial posture, and SATCOM reliability and space resiliency by providing band diversity, assured access, and redundancy for MILSATCOM. Included in the program are Small Ship Variant (SSV - Patrol Coastal or Mine Countermeasure Ships), Unit Level Variant (ULV - examples are Guided Missile Destroyers or Guided Missile Frigates), and Force Level Variant (FLV - large combatant ships such as carriers)."

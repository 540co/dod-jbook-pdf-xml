            "val": "Long Range Radar (AN\/TPS-59) - The AN\/TPS-59A(V)3 is a transportable, three dimensional, tactical radar system that provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with long-range surveillance.  It is the MAGTF's only ground based long range sensor that provides the capability to detect and report Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and track Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM).  The AN\/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar System is connected to the Common Aviation Command and Control Systems (CAC2S).  It provides the air defense controllers data and may be used autonomously to conduct Ground Control Intercept, tactical en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC), or TBM alert operations via the Joint Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) encrypted Link-16.  The USMC extended the AN\/TPS-59 service life through 2035; therefore, in order to maintain its operational relevance on the battlefield, a number of readiness, obsolescence and modernization efforts will be required.\n\nFamily of Target Acquisition Systems (FTAS) - The FTAS provides the MAGTF the capability to locate, identify, and attack enemy indirect fire weapons systems and observe and direct friendly artillery fire. The FTAS consists of the AN\/TPQ-46 Firefinder Radar, the AN\/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar, and the AN\/TSQ-267 Target Processing Set.  The FTAS is critical in the execution of counterfire and the integration of target acquisition information enabling attack by MAGTF assets.  The FTAS also provides artillery firing units the ability to conduct artillery registration and other friendly fire missions.  The FTAS encompasses the equipment required to support target acquisition within the target acquisition platoon and is resident in the headquarters battery of each artillery regiment.  The program will continue to address system issues that arise due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) items within the FTAS.  The USMC assumed the role of Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA) for the AN\/TPQ-49 in FY15 when the Army divested itself from the system."

            "val": "Beginning in FY19, FTAS funding is realigned from BLI 4650, RADAR SYSTEMS to BLI 4733, FIRE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.\n\nFY2018 Base Appropriation Request: $14.811M\n\nAN\/TPS-59: $9.676M - (Active: $6.367M, Reserve: $3.309M)  FY18 funding supported procurement of the initial Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Antenna in order to address obsolescence in the current antenna. Funding also procured two Digital Receiver and Exciter (DREX) Cabinets in support of the TPS-59 Radar System receiver and exciter technical refresh.  In addition, funds supported DREX Production and Deployment materials such as training package and technical data package to support provisioning and fielding; and ECPs such as, Mode 5 training package, and Array Drive Gearbox modifications.   \n  \nFTAS: $5.135M - (Active: $4.850, Reserve: $0.285M) FY18 funding procured ECP Modification Kits and continued to address DMSMS issues within the FTAS. \n\nFY2019 Base Appropriation Request: $6.694M\n\nAN\/TPS-59: $6.694M (Active: $2.312M, Reserve: $4.382M) FY19 funding completes procurement of IFF Antenna; supports procurement of DREX logistics and training products such as EDM technical manuals and product data, and ECPs such as Array Drive assembly and installation.  The decrease of $2.982M from FY18 to FY19 and changes in acquisition strategies from PB19 to PB20 reflects alignment to USMC decision to defer all modernization except the Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5\/S level 1 upgrade and upgrades specifically to prevent system obsolescence beginning in FY20.\n\nFTAS: $0.000M - (Active: $0.000M, Reserve: $0.000M) FY19 decrease is due to a realignment from Budget Line Item (BLI) 4650 to BLI 4733.  Realignment of effort to new BLI in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR.\n\nFY2020 Base Appropriation Request: $0.329M\n\nAN\/TPS-59: $0.329M (Active: $0.329M) Decrease of $6.365M from FY19 to FY20 reflects USMC decision to defer all modernization except the Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5\/S level 1 upgrade and upgrades specifically to prevent system obsolescence.  $0.329M will support procurement and integration of  ECP upgrades with multiple components and various unit costs to mitigate obsolescence and end-of life\/end-of-sale issues."

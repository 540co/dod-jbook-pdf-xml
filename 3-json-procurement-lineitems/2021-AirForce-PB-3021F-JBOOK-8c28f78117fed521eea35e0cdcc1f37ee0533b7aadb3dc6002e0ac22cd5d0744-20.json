Projects include the technical refresh of the GPS Information Network (GIN), deployed in 2012, and the technical refresh of the GPS Ground Antenna Infrastructure, deployed in 2009.  Both systems are beyond design life and require reconstitution.  Spares are needed to support the systems through their remaining life cycles.  Both systems will continue to be required for operations into the OCX era.\n\nSSA Operations: No FY 2020 funding is requested.\n\nSBIRS: No FY 2021 funding is requested."

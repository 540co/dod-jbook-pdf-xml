            "val": "This budget line includes Close Terrain Shaping Obstacle, All Types.\n\n(F78310) This item is landmine policy compliant in accordance with the U.S. National landmine policy.  The Terrain Shaping Obstacle (TSO) Common Munition System is used to disrupt, turn, fix, delay, deter, or deny enemy maneuver.  The TSO Capability detects, tracks, targets, and defeats enemy vehicles moving through the obstacle.  The TSO Capability creates lethal effects by launching Anti-Vehicular (AV) munitions consisting of high explosives that penetrate the top of the targeted vehicles.  The TSO capability denies the enemy terrain and freedom of action in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict while creating time and space for friendly forces to maneuver within the same battle space.  The TSO capability supports Army Modernization Priorities as a critical enabler for soldier lethality and creates targets for long range precision fires within the engagement area.  The TSO capability supports U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) # 18-22702.  This item is code A approved for service use."

            "val": "This program funds replacement of organizational and intermediate level support equipment for all out-of-production ballistic missile systems. Equipment procured is used for missile weapon systems maintenance and testing at organizational\/intermediate (base\/field) launch control facilities, as well as missile testing facilities.  Equipment and qualified minor construction costs related to depot activation. Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.. \n\nThe FY2021 funding request was reduced by $5.656 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nRelated Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Air Force funding is contained in PE 0101213F.\n\n\u2022 Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer\/G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA\/G6B4 BER) program replaces and updates obsolete systems. PIGA\/G6B4 BER EMD activities will modify or replace one Alignment Test Station and one Electrical Alignment Test Station.  Additionally, funds may be used for any parts\/re-work\/technical data necessary for the retrofit of assets produced during RDT&E for operational capability after testing. This is a FY21 Procurement New Start.\n\n\u2022 Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Support Equipment Less Than $5M procures low cost new, modified or replacement support equipment, to include facilities and other equipment to support programmed depot maintenance capability activation. This also includes efforts required to prepare for re-location of T-41 trainer from Malmstrom AFB to Vandenberg AFB. \n\n\u2022 MM Power Panels (PPM):  Minuteman Power Panels replaces obsolete and unsupportable power distribution panels within Launch Control Centers and Launch Facilities. The LGM-30G Power Panels Modification (PPM) modernizes the antiquated power distribution system to improve reliability and sustainability at each of the three wings: Malmstrom, Minot, and FE Warren. Installation of the power panels requires extensive demolition of existing components, relocation of all electrical equipment and installation of the new equipment. Effort also includes technical data and installation necessary for full operation capability of the trainer power panel modification to support PPM.\n\n\u2022 Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Provides nuclear certified tractor and trailer to emplace, extract and transport the reentry system, Propulsion System Rocket Engine, and guidance systems. Replaces current payload transporter to meet USSTRATCOM security requirements and addresses supportability issues. Required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) in 2036.\n\n\u2022 Performance Assessment Data System Communication Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996-1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration. PADS Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from the Launch Control Center (LCC) to the PADS at the support base via telephone lines. CEIU is unclassified equipment, but interfaces with both classified and non-classified systems. This program will update the current CEIU. The change to CEIU design will no longer utilize a modem but will instead use internet protocol (IP).\n\n\u2022 Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  RFSE replaces the current reentry system test set. RFSE will increase the Mean Time Between Failure, eliminate unneeded Mk12 functions, and add new Mk21 functions. It will provide capability to meet Department of Energy mandated Limited Life Component warhead swaps and to test electrical continuity during buildup of Minuteman III reentry systems.\n\n\u2022 Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  The Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces the current transporter erector used to emplace, extract and transport MM III boosters to and from launch facilities. The TERP program will also update existing drawings, specifications and technical orders to eliminate parts obsolescence and support operations through the fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) in 2036."

            "val": "This program, Missile Replacement Eq-Ballistic P-40A Category LGM-30G Item Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer\/G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA\/G6B4 BER), is a new start.\n\nFY21 funding provides replacement support equipment items for an aging inventory of equipment which has become increasingly more costly to maintain. These items will increase ballistic missile system reliability and maintainability by providing state-of-the-art maintenance repair and testing capability. The items are required to bridge the gap to the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy directed nuclear force modernization activities. Requirements are jointly determined by Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and are based on established allowance standards.\n\nItems requested in FY21 are displayed on the attached P-40A. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current and emerging Air Force mission requirements.\n\n\u2022 Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer\/G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA\/G6B4 BER): PIGA\/G6B4 BER program replaces unsustainable equipment due to obsolescence issues affecting the ability to test and build the PIGA and G6B4, using FY21 funds to procure a total of two test stations: one Alignment Test Station and one Electrical Alignment Test Station.\n\n\u2022 Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million: Procured low cost support equipment required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).\n\n\u2022 MM Power Panels (PPM): Procures power panel replacements required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).  Installation of all power panels will complete in FY20.\n\n\u2022 Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR): The production contract was awarded in 3QFY19 for the first production article. Production will start in FY20 with the procurement of 2 units.  FY21 will include award of 5 units for production. \n\n\u2022 Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE): This program was completed in FY20.\n\n\u2022 Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP): Order for the first 4 units occurred in FY19 with 7 additional units procured in FY20. FY21 funding will be used to procure 8 remaining assets required to achieve Full Operational Capability."

The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort consisted of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action fulfilled the requirements of AFGSC. \n\nThe test sets are used to functionally test Mk12A and Mk21 Reentry Systems and the Mk12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections and support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. \n\nJustification: This program was completed in FY20."

            "val": "This program provides for the Provision of Industrial Facilities (PIF).  Funds are used to establish, modernize, expand or replace facilities owned by the Army.  It provides Production Support Equipment Replacement and Modernization to Government-owned equipment and real property used in the production of Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles.  The program also provides funding for Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) and for the redistribution of equipment no longer required for production of Army systems.  This effort supports the Abrams RESET, Systems Enhancement Package (SEP) Programs and Spin-Out Framework.  Funding is required for the preservation, Packing, Crating, Handling, and Transportation (PCH&T) of equipment excess to production, where such actions do not constitute substantial or complete shutdown or excessing of U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) production equipment.  This program also funds projects to prevent unnecessary deterioration, perform maintenance, cover storage expenses of idle items of Government-owned equipment, and unplanned repairs to active equipment as situations arise."

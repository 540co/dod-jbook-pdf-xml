The JLTV approved Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 49,099 vehicles, of various configurations, capable of performing multiple mission roles and designed to provide protected, sustained, networked mobility for personnel and payloads across the full range of military operations.  JLTV objectives include increased protection and performance over the current fleet; and, minimizing ownership costs by maximizing commonality, fuel efficiency, reliability, and maintaining effective competition throughout the life cycle.  Commonality of components, maintenance procedures, training, etc., among vehicles is expected to be inherent in FoV solutions across mission variants to minimize total ownership cost. Unique service requirements have been minimized.\n\nThe JLTV Trailer (JLTV-T) is the companion trailer to the JLTV and safely carries its payload while maintaining the same mobility characteristics of the prime mover. The JLTV-T will be fielded as a system with the JLTV truck.\n\nThe approved Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 49,099 trucks for the U.S. Army.\nThe approved Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 18,224 for JLTV-T for the U.S. Army.\n\nCurrent contract options may be exercised through 30 November 2023 assuming contractual quantity headspace is still available. Current funding indicates headspace quantity of 16,901 may be achieved in FY 2021, with competitive follow on contract award anticipated in FY 2022."

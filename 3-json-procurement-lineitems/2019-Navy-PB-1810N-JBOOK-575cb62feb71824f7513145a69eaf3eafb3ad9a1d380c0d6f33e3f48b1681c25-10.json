            "val": "1U030: Automatic Identification System (AIS) is required for safety of navigation for all surface ships and submarines.   AIS is a maritime Very High Frequency (VHF) communication system, which allows ships to exchange navigation, ship identification, and cargo information machine-to-machine via VHF transponder.  The AIS capability provides Navy ships with the ability to rapidly identify and track commercial shipping, which significantly increases the Navy's ability to distinguish between normal and suspicious merchant ships headed towards United States and allied ports around the globe.  AIS provides critical track data to the Common Operational Picture (COP) on surface ships, AN\/BYG-1 Combat System on submarines, Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) on Force level ships, and Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) at Fleet Maritime Operations Center (MOC)s for publishing AIS data to the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Data Sharing Community of Interest.  The AIS submarine configuration provides an interface to the AN\/BYG-1 Combat System and Encrypted AIS capability that is currently not available on other AIS variants.  This capability dramatically improves the Combatant Commanders' situational awareness and MDA data sharing capabilities in support of regional engagement, and tracking efforts against potential maritime terrorism threats.  \nFunds will procure and install AIS systems for Navy ships, submarines and shore sites consisting of a combination of modified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and government\/commercial software, such as omni-directional VHF, Global Positioning System antennas, AIS transponders, displays and associated cables, servers, power supplies, laptop computers, junction boxes, switches and radio frequency couplers.  Without this configuration of AIS, Navy submarines will not be able to see encrypted AIS track data and will increase the risk of collisions.\n\n[P40A \/ Combat Workstation - Procurement]: The combat workstation is a ruggedized Panasonic Toughbook (CF-54) that provides AIS message data for mission planning."
        },
        "Justification": {
            "val": "The Navy increased the AIS program budget to begin design\/integration efforts to field the AIS capability on Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) mission capable Ohio class (SSBN) submarines.   The need for AIS system is especially important for SSBN submarines, which have limited maneuverability during strategic patrol.  The AIS Submarine configuration provides situational awareness (to include encrypted AIS message traffic from US Coast Guard vessels) to the SSBN Commanding Officer during time constrained ascents to communications depth, thereby significantly reducing the risk of a close-aboard contact situation which has occurred in the past, impacting the already limited resource of these SSBN submarines.   \n\nAdditional funding is to implement United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) Comprehensive review recommendations for adding an AIS Workstation in Combat Information Center (CIC) on Surface Ships.   An AIS Workstation in CIC will allow AIS data to be correlated with information from other sources such as RADAR in CIC resulting in improved situation awareness and mission planning capability. Non-recurring cost associated with network and shipboard certification requirements.  Updating the AIS architecture to integrate an additional AIS Workstation into the Combat Information Center (CIC) will include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs associated with the Ship Modernization process such as Engineering Change and Ship Change documentation, Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) updates, etc.  There are 26 Ship Class drawings that need to be updated to detail where and how the new laptop will be installed in CIC, to include how it will be mounted and interface definitions for network, power, etc.  The new laptop is an added interface to the AIS architecture that requires End to End Integration testing and AI SIT network validation testing and an updated ATO.\n\nThe FY19 funds provide for the procurement of five AIS submarine systems and forty-four Combat Workstations and associated Design Services Allocation; integration testing to support AIS installations on SSBN class submarines and installation funding for two submarines.  The AIS Cyber hardening effort begins in FY19.  Since this modernization effort is required on all platforms, it requires ship class drawings for 26 different classes of ships.   The Cyber Ship Alteration (SHIPALT) effort in FY19 is non-recurring. \n\nIn FY19 funding was realigned from OPN BLI 2361 AIS to OMN 1C1C (Combat Communications and Electronic Warfare) to properly fund integration and sustainment of a cyber hardening capability for AIS.  \n\nAIS procurement unit cost has increased from FY18 to FY19 due to material cost increases. The material cost of the nickel connector components of the AIS system increased from $10k to $20k.  The only other material alternative that meets EMC\/EMI requirements are Stainless Steel connectors at a much higher cost."

AIS procurement unit cost has increased from FY18 to FY19 due to material cost increases. The delta in per unit installations costs is driven by the switch in procurements from AIS (V)3 system installed on Los Angeles Class submarines to the AIS (V)9 system that is required for installation on Ohio Class submarines.  The higher cost of the AIS (V)9 system is largely due to a recent 100% cost increase in price for the nickel connectors that are required to meet submarine EMI\/EMC requirements. The only other material alternative that meets EMC\/EMI requirements are Stainless Steel connectors at a much higher cost.",

The core for GCSS-MC\/LCM Increment 1 is a modern, commercial-off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning software (Oracle e-Business Suite).  The  Increment 1 design focused on enabling the warfighter to operate while deployed with reach back from the battlefield.   Increment 1 replaced 5 legacy supply and maintenance information technology systems and currently supports ~22,000 users world-wide.  The focus of future functions will be enhancing capabilities in the areas of warehousing, distribution, logistics planning, decision support, depot maintenance, and integration with emerging technologies to improve asset visibility."

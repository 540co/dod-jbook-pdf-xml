            "val": "FY 2019 CE2T2 procurement funding was used to support: \n\n1. USCYBERCOM-led CYBER FLAG, CYBER GUARD, and CYBER KNIGHT exercises. The exercise environment included a \"blue forces\" Department of Defense information network, a \"gray\" network of internet spaces to include .gov and .edu domains that emulated Internet sites and user activities, a realistic representation of an adversary \"red\" network, and a management systems network. This emulated training environment utilized the existing Joint Information Operation Range (JIOR) transport layer to directly supported USCYBERCOM's mission. Procurement funding increased storage capacity and improved the survivability\/durability of the target environment.\n \n2. Joint Interoperability Division (JID).  JID provided Tactical Data Link and Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) training. Procurement funds supported acquisition of one Satellite Simulator (SATSIM) and two Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) radio systems required for JICO mission equipment."

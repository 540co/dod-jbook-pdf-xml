            "val": "FY19 funding totals include $33.602M requested for Overseas Contingency Operations to fund the modification of 336 legacy AGM-65 Maverick missiles to Laser Maverick missiles.\n\nAGM-65L is the Air Force Laser Maverick missile that aids in striking moving targets traveling at high velocities with proven accuracy and low collateral damage. The missile is a modification of inventory baseline Maverick missiles. The AGM-65L Maverick missiles replaced electro-optical TV seeker components with new Semi-Active Laser (SAL) components. The AGM-65A\/B Guidance Control System (GCS) is modified to Laser which is the \"L\" variant. For the backend, the AGM-65G Center Aft Section (CAS) mates with the laser GCS for a tactical All-up Round (AUR) laser missile. The modification program is with Raytheon Missile Systems.  Additional baseline Maverick missiles will be modified to Laser Maverick missiles with accrued Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exchange credits. Funding also covers the movement of Maverick GCS units (AGM-65A\/B\/G) between the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant & Raytheon Missile Systems (Tucson, AZ). The older Maverick GCS units are upgraded\/modified to Laser Maverick seekers. \n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207313F.\n\nNote: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options\/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION."

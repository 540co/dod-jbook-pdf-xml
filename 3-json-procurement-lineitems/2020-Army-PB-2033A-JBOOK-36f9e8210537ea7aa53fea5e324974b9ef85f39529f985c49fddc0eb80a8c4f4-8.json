It is used to procure hardware, materials, and hardware installation cost required to complete the modification. Modifications are performed to improve survivability, correct safety deficiencies, increase mission capabilities, extend the useful life, improve supportability, upgrade existing technology, increase efficiency, improve readiness and to meet new legal and regulatory requirements. By modifying existing equipment, the Army maintains a ready, supportable inventory of equipment that meets current requirements and regulations at a cost considerably below that of buying new equipment."

            "val": "FY 2020 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.821 million supports:\n-  The Abrams A2 Heavy Duty Suspension upgrade to the ABV.  The upgrade will replace the obsolete A1 suspension and keep the ABV's suspension common to the current Abrams configuration.  The change will keep the logistics footprint minimized, provide for growth for additional future force protection initiatives and should increase the suspension mean time between failures, increasing system availability. \n-  Full Width Mine Plow Tine Tip Modification to the ABV.  The upgrade consists of replacing the existing tines on each blade section with a tine adaptor and replaceable tip.  The new tip will be held in place by a roll pin.  The modification provides increased capability by strengthening the tine to resist bending in harder soils and the replaceable tip significantly reduces mean time to repair when tips become worn out.  The upgrade will extend the service life of the plow, reduce down time and increase overall availability of the ABV.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

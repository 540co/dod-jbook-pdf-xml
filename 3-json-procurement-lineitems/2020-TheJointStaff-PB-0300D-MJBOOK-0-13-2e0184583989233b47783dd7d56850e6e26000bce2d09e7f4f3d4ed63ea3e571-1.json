CJCS relies upon the Joint Staff to craft and distribute guidance for combatant forces' unified strategic direction, operations under unified commands, and integration into effective combat forces. On behalf of the Chairman, the Joint Staff provides Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, and U.S. war fighters with joint policy, strategy, and doctrine necessary to employ effective joint combat forces in contingencies worldwide."

            "val": "NOTE: This is a new line item to provide visibility into Joint Staff Cyber resources. P-1 Line 15 is a net-zero realignment from P-1 Line 10 (Major Equipment, TJS) from FY 2020 through FY 2024. P-1 Line 10 has been decreased by the amounts displayed in this new line item.\n\nJoint Information Operations Range (JIOR) \n\nThe Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR) provides DoD with a closed-loop network that forms a global live-fire information operations range complex. JIOR uses encrypted tunneling over existing transport networks to conduct mission rehearsal, training, testing, concept development and experimentation in support of Information Operations (IO), Electronic Warfare (EW), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Spectrum Warfare, Space Operations, and Special Operations Forces mission areas in a realistic threat representative environment. JIOR provides the capability to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces on the full spectrum of cyber weapons\/capabilities without risk of observation or fratricide. JIOR is unique within the Department of Defense and is accredited by DIA for operations at Unclassified through Top Secret-Special Compartment Information (TS-SCI) in a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) environment. JIOR is approved for use by Special Access Programs (SAP), Special Access Required Programs (SAR), and for Special Technical Operations (STO). JIOR provides Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C\/S\/A's) and key allied partners the ability to test deployment and collaboratively gain insights into advanced cyberspace and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environments. JIOR integrates available cyberspace ranges with the training\/test audience providing access to low density\/high demand test and training resources including critical infrastructure, cyber targets, internet traffic, and opposing forces. JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments. C\/S\/A's conduct hundreds of mission rehearsal, training, testing, and experimentation events on the JIOR annually.\n\nJIOR procurement funding is used to purchase technology upgrades\/modernization to the JIOR enterprise network. Planned equipment and software modernization enable the JIOR to extend service to 36 new sites while continuing support to the existing 138 JIOR access points. Equipment for 7 of these sites will be procured in FY 2020.\n\nHistorically, JIOR had limited IT refresh funding and has purchased replacement hardware due to failures, end-of-life, or end-of-service constraints which has not allowed for a focused modernization effort. Given the increased cyber mission focus, periodic technology upgrades are required to make the JIOR more efficient, agile, and sufficiently robust to accommodate this significant network expansion to meet the additional Cyber Mission Force demand."

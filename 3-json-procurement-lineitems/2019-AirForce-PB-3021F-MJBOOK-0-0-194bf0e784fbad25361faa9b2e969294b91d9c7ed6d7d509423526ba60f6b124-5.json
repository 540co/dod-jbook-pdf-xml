Funding prior to FY2019 is described in the OPAF P-1, 834010, General Information Technology, Line # 26.\n\nPE 1203173F R&D Space and Missile Operations\nThe Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research\nand Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in support of experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites. The program develops, acquires, and operates satellite command and control (C2) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for the design, development, integration, testing, sustainment, and operations of the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 systems installed in the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and at the Satellite Operations Center 11 (SOC11) located at Schriever AFB, CO and future deployments of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations. Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nPE 1203174F Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development\nLocated at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program supports the AFSPC Space Analysis Center Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system. AVAC is a stand-alone system that provides a crosscutting capability to conduct, support, and report analysis on a myriad of tools, data, models and simulations. This system allows leadership to make decisions based on quantifiable operational impacts output from AVAC based on various vignettes and studies applied to space and cyber assets. Funding buys system-specific hardware, software, routers, licenses, etc., to maintain the efficiency and compatibility with all current models.\n\nDISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Distributed Communications Architecture.  This system provides a network-based communications capability enabling dispersed space personnel to participate in space exercises and wargames and to assist in development, testing, and validation of SIIRTD innovation projects supporting the Combat Air Forces.  It can also support limited command and control capabilities for space operations.\n\nSPACE ANALYSIS CENTER:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Air Force Space Command Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system.  The system provides classified modeling and simulation tools for the AFSPC Space Analysis Center to conduct operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Related modeling and simulation tool development is funded in RDT&E, AF, PE 1203174F, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\""

This effort will incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realized the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities."

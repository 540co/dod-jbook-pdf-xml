The use of the onboard or off-board sensor video by the warfighter dramatically reduces engagement timelines and increases situational awareness.\n\nThe budget request for Spectrum Army Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) will fund the Manned\/Unmanned teaming with the change in Small UAS frequency which encompasses a wide range of activity including modification, integration, testing, and production of MUMT-X, MUMT-2 and ROVER 6 radios."

            "val": "The Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC) consists of Commercial and Government Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) software and COTS hardware. TMPC is the mission planning segment of the Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) that provides subsystems for the precision targeting, route planning, mission distribution, and strike management of Tomahawk cruise missile missions from sites located ashore and afloat. TMPC optimizes all aspects of the Tomahawk missile mission to successfully engage a target.  TMPC has evolved into 4 scalable configurations deployed at 189 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3), Tomahawk Strike Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (19 - 10 CVN), and Firing Units (FRUs) (145 - 88 Surface \/ 57 Subsurface). Additionally, TMPC is installed in labs (6) and training classrooms (13) that contain various combinations of the four configurations.\n\nContinuous TMPC software updates decreases mission planning time and increases the quality and accuracy of each mission while reducing complexity. TMPC provides mission planning at the theater and operational levels and is designed for high rate mission planning production responsive to national strategic, operational, and tactical requirements. TMPC produces and distributes missions; provides command information services; provides strike planning, execution, coordination, control and reporting, and provides Maritime Component Commanders (MCC) the capability to plan or modify conventional TWS missions.  TMPC supports major joint combat operations and Overseas Contingency Operations. TMPC was previously referred to as Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).\n\nFunds provide for systems engineering, testing, Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V), security accreditation, installation, site acceptance testing, user familiarization of products, and hardware. Also, this funding line provides for COTS refreshment, engineering changes, software upgrades, cyber-security modernization, and associated Nuclear Powered General Purpose Attack Submarine\/Guided Missile Destroyer\/Guided Missile Cruiser\/Nuclear Aircraft Carrier (SSNs\/DDGs\/CGs\/CVN) logistics and infrastructure to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing and future TMPC system configurations.\n\nSurface and Submarine Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) is a post milestone III program executing its first major tech refresh since its 2004 IOC. This refresh resolves processor, display console, equipment rack and software obsolescence issues. The updated TTWCS version was released in FY 2017, but hardware and software must be procured and delivered throughout the next several years to promulgate it across the entire fleet, FRUs (145 - 88 Surface \/ 57 Subsurface), labs (6), and initial training classrooms (2). Advanced TTWCS functions include: tasking validation (missile mission matching), planning of over the water routes, initialization, preparation and launch of BLK III\/IV missiles, TTWCS reduced response time and increased operational flexibility through addition of Launch Platform Mission Planning (LPMP), C4I Web services interfaces, and in-flight monitoring and control of Blk IV missiles. In addition, funds provided to continue TTWCS viability in TTWCS v5.6 and ensure compliance with cyber security mandates, continue to address hardware obsolescence through periodic COTS hardware refresh and periodically refresh of GOTS software to address obsolescence, support migration from 32 bit to 64 bit architecture and migrate away from legacy Ada code. Finally, it will allow reduction of system complexity and incorporation of critical software fixes.  Program options are being identified that will enable TWS integration into future platforms.  Included in those options will be changes necessary for TTWCS to ensure required functionality as the missile is modernized beginning in FY 2020."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2020 funding is required to continue fielding TTWCS hardware\/software obsolescence updates. Funds also provide for integration, modernization and interoperability efforts necessary to keep pace with changes, retain capability and exploit capabilities of internal (TWS All-Up-Round missile and TTWCS) and external (Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB)), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Integrated Backbone (DIB) compliance, Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) imagery formats and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) interfaces, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid\/Internet Protocol (GIG\/IP) (V)6, FORCEnet compliance systems\/interfaces to the effectiveness of the TWS, into TMPC deployed configurations.  Funding supporting TTWCS is appropriately phased to complete the 1st major tech refresh since IOC in 2004.  TTWCS relies on COTS hardware that requires a constant and predictive upgrade path to meet cyber security mandates, ensure continued vendor supportability, avoid costly retrofits of fielded systems, and ensure interoperability between tightly coupled COTS software applications, operating systems, and hardware processing nodes.  Consequently, increased product improvement resources are required to comply with commercial hardware\/software supportability mandates, obsolescence, and information assurance requirements to maintain pace with modern computing architectures.\n\nFY 2020 funding is required to continue the upgrade of unsupportable and obsolete TMPC hardware and software, to ensure compliance with DoD cyber-security mandates, to continue fielding of TMPC 5.0.2 to 189 sites, and to continue navigation and communications improvements required to support the TWS Modernization program via TMPC 6.0. FY 2020 supports TMPC 5.0.2 installation of both hardware and software required for upgrading the Microsoft Operating System from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to ensure continued interrupted Tomahawk Weapon System capability beyond Windows 7 end of life in 2020.  FY 2020 also supports hardware and software procurements and installation for TMPC 6.0 IOC.  FY 2020 decrease in funds from FY2019 is primarily the result of a partially funded unique hardware buy in FY 2019 to support anti-tamper capability for the Tomahawk Planning System (TPS) component of the TMPC required to protect Critical Program Information. Integration is planned for the period FY 2019 - FY 2021. This anti-tamper capability will permit implementation of advanced capabilities of the Tomahawk Modernization program with needed anti-tamper safeguards."

FY 2020 also supports hardware and software procurements and installation for TMPC 6.0 IOC. FY 2020 decrease from FY 2019 levels is the result of a unique hardware buy in FY 2019 to support anti-tamper capability for the Tomahawk Planning System (TPS) component of the TMPC required to protect Critical Program Information. Completion of this unique hardware procurement will be executed FY 2020 using a qualified manufacturer. Integration is planned for the period FY 2019 - FY 2021. This anti-tamper capability will permit implementation of advanced capabilities of the Tomahawk Modernization program with needed anti-tamper safeguards.",

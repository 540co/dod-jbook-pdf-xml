Initial spares consist of reparable components, assemblies and subassemblies, as well as consumable items required in support of newly fielded end items.  Requirements are based on historical failure\/demand data on similar items.  Replenishment spares consist of reparable components, assemblies and subassemblies required for follow-on sustainment of end items.  Munitions replenishment spare levels are based on item-specific failure\/demand driven computations.\n\nProvide Area Attack telemetry kit WSEP analysis for Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD). Contractor will perform engineering study, installation, delivery and testing for WCMD weapons with telemetry kits.\n\nPE associated with this P-1 Line is 0208030F."

            "val": "Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS):  JRSS is a Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations.  JRSS will replace the existing Navy cyber protection boundaries allowing for a common and operable cyber defense network across all of the DoD. The Joint Information Environment (JIE) scope which included JRSS was laid out broadly in a series of Joint Chiefs of Staff Tank and Deputy Secretary Management Action Group (DMAG) decisions in 2012.  DoD CIO, via the JIE EXCOM, has further refined the priorities of those tasks, consistent with the implementation strategy.  JRSS is DoD's near term modernization priority, and is fielded as an Enterprise Service, as designated by the DoD CIO in November 2015.  With the designation of JRSS as an Enterprise Service, the DoD CIO required JRSS be separately identified.\n\nInformation Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3: Funding supports procurement of software, licensing upgrades and technical support, to include patches and version upgrades as required, for the Joint Information Management System (JIMS). This software enables JIMS to work across systems (Navy to Joint); provides reciprocal communications via web service calls; allows process and technology interfaces for incident reporting and provides situational awareness of U.S. Navy incidents.\n\nDeployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) Kits: Funding supports the procurement and maintenance of Deployable Mission Support System (DMSS) kits. DMSS kits are operated by Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) to survey, secure, and protect military networks aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide. DMSS kits are used onsite to assess vulnerability and incident response with little to no notice. CPTs are able to conduct intensive, computation heavy analysis when bandwidth is limited or unavailable and able to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into all theaters.\n\n[P5 \/ [USFFC] INFOCON 3 - Security Compliance NAVIFOR]: FY21 funds support procurement of software, licensing upgrades, and technical support for hardware\/software that enhance analytical capacity and Host Based Security System mission system changes which provide warning to mitigate host level malicious activity. The software enables Joint Information Management System (JIMS) capability to work across systems (Navy to Joint); provides reciprocal communications via web service calls; allows process and technology interfaces for incident reporting, and provides situational awareness of U.S. Navy incidents.\n\n[P5 \/ [USFFC] Deployable Mission Support Systems]: Deployable Mission Support System (DMSS) are operated by Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) to survey, secure, and protect military networks aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites. The Navy is responsible for 20 CPTs within the Cyber Mission Force (CMF).  Per USCYBERCOM System Requirements Document (SRD) V1.0, each CPT must be provided with two (2) DMSS kits to support two (2) simultaneous team deployments.  Hardware and software obsolescence in a rapidly changing cyber environment along with mobile deployments requires a technical refresh every three (3) years to maintain operational readiness. This funding profile will achieve the goal to assign each of the twenty (20) CPTs two (2) DMSS kits."

FY 2021 JRSS funding was further realigned to DISA to pay for the Navy's fair share of the JRSS must pay bill. \n\nInformation Operations Condition (INFOCON) 3 (+$3.899M): Starting in FY 2021, funding for INFOCON 3, Security Compliance, realigned from budget line item 8106. Additionally, increase from FY20 to FY21 for INFOCON (8106 and 8645) is to bring new Artificial Intelligence and hyper convergence infrastructure capabilities in support of host based security system, assured compliance assessment solution, continuous monitoring risk scoring-navy and other systems required to mitigate attacks. \n\nDeployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) Kits (+$12.624M): Starting in FY 2021, funding for Deployable Mission Support Systems, realigned from budget line item 8120. Funds required for procurement, integration, fielding and modernization of Small, Medium and Large Scale Communication Systems for Naval Expeditionary forces. Additionally, program funds procure, integrate, field and modernize tactical C4I, including Rapid Response Kits (RRK), rapid-deployable, roll on\/roll off C2 suite to support Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures (ExMCM), referred to as Expeditionary Carry-on. Per USCYBERCOM DMSS System Requirements Document V1.0, each Cyber Protection Team (CPT) must be provisioned with two (2) DMSS kits to support two (2) simultaneous 13-man team deployments (40 total). The primary mission of a CPT is to survey, secure, and protect military networks aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide which necessitates onsite vulnerability assessments and incident response on little to no notice.  Field deployable computing assets for the twenty (20) Navy CPTs are required to allow globally deployable teams to conduct intensive, computation heavy analysis when reach-back capability is unavailable or bandwidth is limited.  Additionally, Navy CPTs located CONUS will be required to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into theater to support U.S. Fourth Fleet (C4F), U.S. Fifth Fleet (C5F), U.S. Sixth Fleet (C6F), and U.S. Seventh Fleet (C7F) mission assurance objectives to include identification of cyber key terrain and Operation Plan (OPLAN) development.

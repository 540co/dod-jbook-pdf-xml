            "val": "This line item funds modifications to UH-1N and UH-1H\/TH-1H aircraft.  The two-engine UH-1N is a light, utility helicopter primarily used for missile site and range support and distinguished visitor airlift support.  There are 62 UH-1N aircraft in the inventory.  They were built with an estimated service life of 10,000 flight hours and are not service limited due to on-going modifications and upgrades.  There are 28 TH-1H aircraft in the inventory.  They are used in the helicopter track for USAF Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training.  The TH-1H modernization modification provided a service life of 20 years, the last one was delivered in 2013.\n\nStarting in FY19 the UH-1N Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was added for a portion of the UH-1N fleet to address aging fleet problems to include: structural repairs, replacement of key systems based on structural fatigue, system obsolescence and a diminishing manufacturing industrial base.  Additionally, this effort will address safety requirements to include: Federal Aviation Administration, DoD, engineering mandates and configuration changes.  This effort includes funding for the UH-1N System Program Office (e.g., A&AS, support, travel). The funds budgeted FY 2019 - 2022 will enable the SLEP of up to 63 aircraft required to meet mission requirements until the MH-139A helicopter is fielded to replace the UH-1N.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.\n\nFunding in this exhibit is contained in PE 0101235F, PE 0401314F, and PE 0804747F."

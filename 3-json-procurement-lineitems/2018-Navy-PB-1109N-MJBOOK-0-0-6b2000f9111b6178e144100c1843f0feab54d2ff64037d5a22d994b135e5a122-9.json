            "val": "Ground Based Air Defense-Transformation (GBAD-T) supports the Low Altitude Air Defense (LAAD) Battalion's missions of Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), to include, Bases, Posts and Stations, the necessary Force Protection to defeat the full spectrum of threats associated with the Marine Corps Low-Altitude Air Defense mission, to include hostile aerial threats from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).  The Advanced Man-Portable Air Defense System (A-MANPADS) Fire Unit is a mobile, Stinger missile-based low altitude surface-to-air weapons system designed to provide close-in short range air defense. A-MANPADS assets are organic to the Low Altitude Air-Defense (LAAD) Battalion of the Marine Air Control Group (MACG). LAAD Battalions support the Marine Air Ground Task Force by defending forward combat areas, maneuver forces, vital areas and installations, and units engaged in special or independent operations.  The LAAD Battalion consists of a headquarters and two A-MANPADS firing batteries. Each firing battery, in turn, consists of a battery headquarters and two A-MANPADS firing platoons.  Firing platoons include a platoon headquarters and three firing sections, the smallest tactical units of the LAAD Battalion.  The A-MANPADS Section is comprised of a Section Leader and five Fire Units.  The Section Leader oversees the deployment of the Fire Units and directs their fires in support of the overall air defense plan.  A major service-life extension must be conducted in order to mitigate the potential gap between the current and follow-on weapon system.  Therefore, GBAD is executing a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), due to the approaching shelf life expiration of the Stinger Missile.  Additionally, GBAD requires an Optics upgrade\/replacement of the current Stinger Missile Night Sight (AN\/PAS-18), and replacement of the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) belt pack (AN\/PPX-3B).  With the proliferation of both military and commercial UAS platforms, the program anticipates pursuing and acquiring GBAD Future Weapons System platforms with Counter-UAS capability now and for the foreseeable future."

It sustained Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that was technologically and economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provided increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding was used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ (including YTC's Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK)."

These vehicles provide inconspicuous protection and transportation for U.S. personnel and cargo in high threat areas, such as Europe, Korea, and Southwest Asia.  The level of armor is in accordance with the nature and type of threat in the area of use.  These vehicles are heavy duty passenger vehicles and are utilized by General Officers, dignitaries, embassy personnel, and other Service members requiring protection.  These vehicles are essential for protecting lives.  Heavy Armored Sedan is a vehicle replacement program that does not have a set Army Acquisition Objective (AAO).  Procurements are made when requirements arise based on threat conditions or when existing vehicles need to be replaced due to unserviceable condition or over-age and over-mileage status.\n\nFunds in this program are being realigned to SSN D30000 (Nontactical Vehicles, Other), beginning in FY 2021."

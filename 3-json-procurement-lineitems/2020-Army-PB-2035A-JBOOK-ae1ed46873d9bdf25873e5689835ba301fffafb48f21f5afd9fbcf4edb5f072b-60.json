The Vigilant Pursuit (VP) capability provides multi-intelligence collection, exploitation, and analytic capabilities, delivering timely, relevant, actionable intelligence to facilitate decision making at the tactical edge.  VP supports mission overwatch in the target area of interest by immediate triage of data on the objective, time-sensitive detection, and the cross tipping\/cueing of HUMINT and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT).

This funding purchases commercial components of hardware packages necessary to upgrade and refactor the Multi-Int capabilities to collect against continually changing threats.  This procurement also allows for the refactoring of the capability package to be installed on different vehicle types and allows units to tailor the hardware to support mission or concept of support specific requirements."

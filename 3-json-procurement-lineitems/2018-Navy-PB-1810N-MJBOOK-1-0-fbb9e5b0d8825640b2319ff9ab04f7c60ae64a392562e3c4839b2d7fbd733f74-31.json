These funds will procure ATC systems for the Navy\/Marine ATC facilities.\n\nThe Air Force is the DoD lead activity for the Joint Acquisition Program.  The Joint Program Office is located at Hanscom AFB, MA.\n\nThe NAS Mod program received a full rate production decision on 7 June 2005 and is in the production and deployment phase following Milestone C.\n\n*Prior years total includes funding associated with cost elements no longer funded by this program.\n\nFunding for procurements, support costs and associated installs for FY2017 and beyond have been realigned to Ashore ATC Equipment (BLI 2820)."

A major component of this capability is Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, which will provide aircraft position information to augment ground-based radar.  Existing DoD Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities interface with FAA's facilities, therefore the military must maintain interoperability and retain vital special-use airspace for combat readiness training. The DoD Advanced Automation System must be upgraded to meet this requirement."

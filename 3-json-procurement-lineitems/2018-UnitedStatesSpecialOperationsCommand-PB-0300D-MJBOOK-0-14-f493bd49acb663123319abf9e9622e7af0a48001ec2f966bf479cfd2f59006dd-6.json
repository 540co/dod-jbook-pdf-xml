The mission of the U-28 is to provide a manned fixed wing capability for improved tactical airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting in support of Theater Special Operations Forces.  This line funds SOF-peculiar modifications to U-28 aircraft and low cost modifications for the Mission Training Device (MTD), and support equipment to meet evolving mission requirements.  This program received a congressional transfer in FY 2016 and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in FY 2017.  There is no associated RDT&E."

            "val": "1.  Mission Systems:  Provides SOF-unique modifications to include: avionics; communication systems; Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems; mission workstations; and mission software.\n\nFY 2018 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION: Procures and installs low cost modifications to U-28 mission systems.\n\n2.  Mission Training Device (MTD):  Program procures concurrency, obsolescence, and fidelity low cost modifications to the U-28 MTD ensuring realistic full-spectrum training and mission rehearsal capabilities.  The MTD reduces risk for complex mission sets, reduces overall costs and safety stresses of live training required to attain aircraft and mission proficiency.\n\nFY 2018 PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION:  Procures and installs MTD simulator low cost modifications to mission systems.\n\n3.  Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) Sensor.  A full motion video sensor that provides electro-optical and infrared real-time video.  The system also houses a laser designator that is co-aligned with the video.  The MTS Sensor program received Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in FY2017.\n\n4.  Advanced Threat Warning (ATW) System.  A sensor that provides threat warning of missiles, hostile fire, and lasers that are engaging an aircraft.  The ATW System program received OCO funding in FY 2017.\n\n5.  U-28 Infrared Suppression.  Continues Joint Urgent Operational Need S0-0010 solution which began in FY 2016. Modification lowers U-28 infrared signature that reduces engagement risk and makes flares more effective.\n\nFY 2018 OCO PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION:  Completes the infrared suppression project that was initiated in FY 2017. \n\n6.  U-28 Global Positioning System (GPS) Improvements.  Provides ability to operate in a GPS degraded environment improving survivability\/readiness of aircraft supporting ongoing operations.\n\n7.  U-28 Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast (ADS\u2013B) Upgrade.  Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) mandate to improve safety and efficiency enabling unrestricted flight profiles in FAA airspace. This allows aircraft to conduct unrestricted training, transit and ISR operations.\n\n8.  U-28 EQ+ Modification.  Follow-on effort to CMNS 210 to directly support C-ISIS operations. Enables deployment of two additional aircraft with 20\" High Definition Full Motion Video Multi-Spectral Targeting System B Sensors OCONUS providing both extended stand-off operations and an enhanced Find, Fix, Finish capability."

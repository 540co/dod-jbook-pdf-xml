            "val": "Persistent Surveillance Systems - Tethered (PSS-T) is a program of record comprised of 29 Large (formerly Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS)) and 29 Medium (formerly Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS)) sized Aerostats. PSS-T has been assigned to Army Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S).  Both tethered Aerostats are equipped with high resolution Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) camera systems and wide-area assessment sensors. Video collected by PSS-T is distributed to the Forward Operating Base and division commander information center as well as to quick reaction forces via Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Extension Kits, providing tactical commanders enhanced battlefield situational awareness.\n\nPTDS - The baseline configuration includes the US Army Research Lab's Unattended Transient Acoustic Measurement and Signature INTelligence (MASINT) System (UTAMS) which operationally cues the PTDS MX-20 EO\/IR sensor to slew onto a target. The UTAMS is an acoustic sensor design consisting of sensor stations linked via radio to a base station. Each sensor station includes microphone arrays, signal processor, and display. The baseline PTDS also includes the Joint Synchronization Information Transmitter (JSIT) Mini-Tactical Common Data Link transmitter that transmits MX-20 video stream to ground forces equipped with One System Remote Video Terminal. Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PTDS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response. PTDS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding High Antennas for Radio Communications (HARC) radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Highband Networking Radio (HNR) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) via weather relay kits; added dual sensor capability; additional ground moving target indicator STARLite and wide area motion imagery Kestrel sensors, Persistent Surveillance Systems (PSS) Slew to Cue, coded laser target designation, and Survivability enhancements.\n\nThe PGSS has been a highly successful example of quickly delivering urgently needed capabilities to the Warfighter at remote forward operating bases (FOBs). PGSS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding HARC radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Quint Networking Technology (QNT), and micro-Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to AFWA via PGSS Weather Web, added dual sensor capability; additional Vista, Kestrel, and wireless identification sensing platforms (WISP) sensors, PSS Slew to Cue, Precision Fires, coded laser target designation, and Survivability enhancements. Additionally, Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PGSS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response."

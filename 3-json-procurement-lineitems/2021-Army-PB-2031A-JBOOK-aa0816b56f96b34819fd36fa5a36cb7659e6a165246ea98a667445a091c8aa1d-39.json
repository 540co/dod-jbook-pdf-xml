The analog launchers are non-repairable, yet durable enough to withstand at least 16 rocket firings per tube before being discarded. The empty weight of the M260 analog launcher is approximately 35 pounds and the empty weight of the M261 analog launcher is approximately 82 pounds. The analog launcher permits fuze-timing selections from the cockpit and will launch guided \/ unguided rockets using either the MK40 or the MK66 motors. 2.75 Inch Rocket Launcher procurement funding supports the launcher system to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, and production issues."

            "val": "This appropriation is for the continuation of prime contractor post production support, procurement of deferred peculiar ground support equipment, peculiar training equipment, mission support, interim contract support, and activities associated with F-16 production line shutdown. \n\nThe USG stores tooling identified as required to be re-utilized to manufacture spares, support aircraft modifications, or other purposes.  It would require millions of dollars to re-manufacture these tools and the delivery lead-time of the required tool\/part would take several years to reproduce.  Funding for these contracts is essential since the F-16 Program Offices require specialized engineering services to ensure continued fleet support capability during, and beyond, the Production Line Shutdown (PLS). The requirement is annual funding to maintain the Electronic Tool Inventory Management System (eTIMS) in cooperation with the Lexes Inc. and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Inc, as well as the actual teardown, shipping and storage of unique aircraft manufacturing equipment."

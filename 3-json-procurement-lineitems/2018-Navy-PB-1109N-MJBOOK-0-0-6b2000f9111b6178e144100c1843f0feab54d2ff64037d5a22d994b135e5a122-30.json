            "val": "NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT (NVE) - Consists of multiple optical, Electro-Optical (EO) and laser systems which allow the dismounted Marine the ability to acquire, locate, identify, and engage targets during daylight and limited visibility conditions, and perform navigation and manual tasks during limited visibility conditions utilizing ambient or covert illumination. Current systems typically are comprised of a single operating modality, such as direct viewing of visible wavelengths, low light image intensification (I2), thermal imaging or short wave infrared (SWIR).  Complementary systems, such as near-infrared laser pointers viewable only through I2 devices, provide enhancement of threat identification capabilities. Additionally the portfolio includes procurement of ammunition to support testing and evaluation of night vision equipment; and continue coordination with United States Army on optic, thermal, and night vision technologies.      \n\nCOMBAT OPTICS - Previously named Family of Optical Systems (FOS) and Family of Optical Systems and Modifications (FOSAM).  This program encompasses all optical systems providing handheld, helmet and weapons mounted optic systems such as various thermal, image intensifier, magnified optical, laser range-finding, illuminating, short wave infrared, and pointer functionalities.  Replaces multiple single-purpose NVE fielded to the Marine Corps. Additionally the portfolio includes procurement of ammunition to support testing and evaluation of various Combat Optics; and continue coordination with United States Army on optic, thermal, and night vision technologies.       \n\nTHERMAL WEAPON SIGHT (TWS) -  The TWS Program supports individual thermal imaging capabilities, such as the AN\/PAS-13 TWS, the AN\/PAS-22 Long Range Thermal Imager (LRTI), the AN\/PAS-27 Individual Weapon Night Sight - Thermal (IWNS-T), the AN\/PAS-28 Medium Range Thermal Bi-ocular (MRTB), the AN\/PAS-30 Mini Thermal Imager (MTI), and the Squad Thermal System (STS).  Thermal imagers operate by discerning the temperature variation between targets and their background and are completely passive devices.  Thermal imagers can be used not only for target detection and engagement with Marine Corps individual and crew-served weapons; they can be used for all-weather surveillance as well; and continue coordination with United States Army on optic, thermal, and night vision technologies.  \n\nFAMILY OF INFANTRY WEAPONS SYSTEMS (FIWS) - Procures NVE Principle End Item (PEI) systems lost or damaged beyond economical repair.  The focus of PEI Reprocurement is to support those items that have no active procurement program to meet urgent requirements due to combat losses and increased usage.\n\nFunding for Night Vision Equipment moves to BLI 4620 beginning in FY 2017."

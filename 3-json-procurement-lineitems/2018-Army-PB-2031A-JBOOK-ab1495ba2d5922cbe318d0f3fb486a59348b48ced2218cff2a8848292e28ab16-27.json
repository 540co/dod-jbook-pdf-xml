            "val": "The Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasure (ATIRCM) is an infrared (IR) countermeasure system that interfaces with the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) to provide near spherical protection of the host aircraft platform in order to defeat IR threat missiles. The operational concept of ATIRCM is as part of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM). The core components of the SIIRCM concept are: a Missile Warning System (MWS), expendable countermeasures (flares) and a laser based IR countermeasure (IRCM). The CMWS detects, declares, and initiates IRCM against IR-guided Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) or Air-to-Air Missiles (AAM).  ATIRCM takes a hand-off cue from CMWS and then takes immediate action as a laser based countermeasure against the incoming threat missile.  \n \nThe A-Kit for ATIRCM includes mounting hardware, wiring harnesses, and other components necessary to install and interface the mission kit on host aircraft.  The ATIRCM B-Kit is the mission kit (laser, optical coupler, infrared jam head, and jam head control unit) required to achieve near spherical coverage for an aircraft.\n\nThe ATIRCM program is a post-Milestone C, Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1C program of record fielded on CH-47F aircraft.\n\nThe approved Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for ATIRCM is 340 A-Kits and 120 B-Kits."

            "val": "The Counter Communications System (CCS) Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) program provides expeditionary, deployable, reversible offensive space control (OCS) effects applicable across the full spectrum of conflict. It prevents adversary satellite communications (SATCOM) in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Command and Control (C2), Early Warning, and Propaganda; and hosts Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to Urgent Needs. Acquisition Decision Memorandum (24 April 2009) directed all capabilities identified in the October 2006 CCS Block 20, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved Capability Development Document (CDD) shall be accomplished as P3I upgrades to the CCS Block 10. No funding requested for CCS in FY 2019.\n\nFunding for this exhibit and developmental funding for CCS is in Program Element 1206421F, BPAC 65A001 Counterspace Systems.\n\nBounty Hunter (BH) supports the Defensive Space Control of US systems in a specific AOR and provides the capacity to prevent effective adversary use of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I). The system was originally a response to Joint Urgent Operational Need.  In 2013 AF Requirements Oversight Council directed incorporation of BH capabilities into a Program of Record. Funds requested in FY19 is for Bounty Hunter.\n\nDevelopmental funding for BH is in Program Element 1206421F, BPAC 65A013 Bounty Hunter.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\""

Funding in FY 2019 provides equipment (e.g., emitters, antennas, spectrum analyzers) upgrades to the currently deployed BH system to counter emerging Electro-magnetic Interference (EMI), and EMI upgrades to the second BH system currently in CONUS.\n\nRapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain.

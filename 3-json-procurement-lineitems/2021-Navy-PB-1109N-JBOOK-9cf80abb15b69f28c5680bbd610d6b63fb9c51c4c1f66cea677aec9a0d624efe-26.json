            "val": "Beginning in FY 2020, MARINE CORPS CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS GROUP (MCCOG), and UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS FORCES CYBERSPACE COMMAND (MARFORCYBER) were transferred to a new procurement line item, 4645 Cyberspace Activities, in order to consolidate Marine Corps Cyberspace Procurement Activities into one LI.  \n\nMARINE CORPS COMMON HARDWARE SUITE (MCHS) provides Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) laptops, workstations, software, servers, and other information technology (IT) hardware devices (ie Mobility) to support the Operating Forces and other Marine Corps customers. MCHS provides support for two principal groups: 1) United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical and Functional Programs of Record that use COTS IT hardware as part of their fielded systems, and 2) tactical and other Marine Corps customers not supported by Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) such as Marine Corps Forces, Europe; Marine Corps Forces, Korea; Marine Corps Forces, Africa; and stand-alone Marine Corps units and schoolhouses.\n\nFORMALIZED SCHOOLS TECHNICAL REFRESH (FSTR) funds and manages the software and IT hardware required to provide a robust and reliable Computer-Based Training (CBT) capability for TECOM (Training and Education Command) schools. Computers used in TECOM classrooms are not funded or managed by HQMC as part of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), and must therefore be funded and managed by the FSTR program.  This program standardizes IT equipment for the 812 classrooms throughout TECOM and formalizes the upgrade and refresh process.  In order to maintain adequate reliability and software compliance, computers need to be refreshed every four years. FSTR provides reliable hardware, software, and network resources to support Marine Corps Programs of Instruction and curriculum, delivered in TECOM formal classrooms.  The FSTR program is foundational to realizing the Commandant of the Marine Corps' vision of exploiting technology as an enabler to advance Training & Education capabilities.\n\nMARINE CORPS ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES (MCEITS) provides an overarching portfolio of capabilities to deliver \"Power to the Edge\" for the Marine Corps.  Born from an effort to establish a Continuity of Operations Plan of Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Automated Information Systems, MCEITS is a unifying framework of both the Net-Centric Enterprise Services to be delivered, and the infrastructure and systems which must be deployed to enable delivery of those services.  MCEITS realigns the existing USMC environment of applications, databases, networks, and facilities into an integrated architecture. It provides the environment to access enterprise shared data and services while improving operational flexibility, responsiveness, and effectiveness for operating forces and the supporting establishment based on a common infrastructure and shared services.  MCEITS allows for achievement of architectural standardization, consolidated management, seamless interoperability, and access to the data residing in our currently fielded applications (business and tactical).  MCEITS enables access to enterprise information and provides the ability to collaborate and share information across the business and warfighter domains.  MCEITS includes work to rationalize, modernize, virtualize, migrate, and host systems and applications residing in the Marine Corps enterprise information technology center (i.e., data center) located in Kansas City, Missouri. Additionally, MCEITS has a secondary, fail-over site located in Camp Lejuene, North Carolina, a System Integration Environment (SIE), and two Distributed Platforms.  Procurement funding provides for various network equipment to include computers,network equipment, racks along with associated installation costs. In addition, procurement funding supports efforts to include cloud aligned to the Managed Services Organization (MSO). \n\nMARINE CORPS RECRUITING INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEM (MCRISS) is an enterprise level system to automate administrative procedures for recruiting station operations. This customized automated System, centered on procedures in the Guidebook for Recruiters, Volume I, dramatically improves efficiency and effectiveness in Marine Corps recruiting.  Furthermore, Military Entrance Processing Command requires Marine Corps recruiting to provide information in electronic format only. MCRISS is the Marine Corps Recruiting Command's program to manage applicant processing from commitment to accession\/commission into the Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve. This enterprise approach allows for efficient sharing of information about potential recruits and recruiter screening efforts, yielding a more cost effective process.\n\nMARINE CORPS CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS GROUP (MCCOG) (formerly MCNOSC) executes Marine Corps Global Information Grid Operations and Marine Corps Defensive Cyber Operations in support of Marine Corps operational requirements in order to enhance freedom of action across all warfighting domains, while denying the efforts of adversaries to degrade or disrupt this advantage through cyberspace.  MCCOG is the Network Operations (NETOPS) component of Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command and provides network situational awareness, command and control, and technical support to Marine Corps operating forces and supporting establishment organizations, both in garrison and while deployed. MCCOG is the primary DOD Computer Network Defense Service Provider for the U.S. Marine Corps and directs Service actions to prevent and respond to security incidents. The MCCOG delivers numerous enterprise services for the Marine Corps, to include mainframe computer services management, Defense Message System (DMS), DOD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and Active Directory\/Global Address List. The MCCOG is responsible for the operations and defense of MCEITS, which delivers data center services to the Marine Corps. Finally, MCCOG provides technical expertise to HQMC, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), and Marine Corps organizations around the world in support of Information Technology initiatives undertaken within the Marine Corps and DOD. The PMC funding will support Core Competencies in the Computer Networks Defense and NETOPS areas with skilled cyber-warriors (24x7x365).  The added responsibilities and network security events have required continued operational employment of current assets and personnel. PMC funding is based on increased mission requirements dictated by DoD\/USSTRATCOM\/USCYBERCOM to defend the network. The procurement funding will be used to refresh the MCCOG Alternate Network Operations Security Center, USMC Site R refresh, Network Common Operational Picture Tools, Host Based Security Systems, Secure Configuration Compliance Validation Initiative and Secure Configuration Remediation Initiative (SCCVI\/SCRI), Intrusion Prevention and scanning tools, Virtual Private Network, and other operations and defense tools.  Beginning in FY20 this effort moves to LI 4645.\n\nSECURE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS (SONIC) program provides funding to procure and support hardware, software, infrastructure and services necessary to support and improve critical C2 network operations. This funding enables central management of refresh and sustainment of hardware, software, and the infrastructure necessary to provide network services on the USMC Garrison SIPRNET.  This ensures enterprise architecture goals and standards are established and maintained and takes advantage of quantity-related discounts. The SIPRNET provides Marine Corps garrison forces with a secure digital means to communicate and share data, information, and knowledge at the secret level with dispersed organizations located around the world. SONIC resources the tech refresh of technologically obsolete equipment, shortfalls in network operational capabilities, solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities, and technology insertion for increased SIPRNET capability as expressed by the Marine Corps Forces (MARFORs). Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, and functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum Information Operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO across the range of military operations within the physical, informational and cognitive dimensions of the information environment in a Service, Joint or Coalition setting. \n\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS FORCES CYBERSPACE COMMAND (MARFORCYBER) will procure hardware and software for Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS).  DMSS kits are maintained with hardware support and software renewals, and refresh perpetual software licenses for DMSS kits. Beginning in FY20 this effort moves to LI 4645.\n\nPAPERLESS ACQUISITION (PA) SYSTEMS is comprised of two programs, Purchase Request Builder (PR Builder) and Standard Procurement System \/ Procurement Desktop Defense (SPS\/PD2).  PR Builder is a fully web-based, Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III sensitive business system.  SPS\/PD2, part of the Joint SPS Acquisition Program, is the USMC's authoritative contracting generation system within the Marine Corps' electronic Systems Business Enterprise.  Both of these systems provide system-to-system interface with other DoD financial management systems which include Standard Accounting, Budgeting, and Reporting System (SABRS), Federal Government's Electronic Document Access system (EDA), and Invoice, Receipt Acceptance and Property Transfer.\n\nTECHNOLOGY SERVICES ORGANIZATION (TSO):provides development, testing, and production hosting environments in support of the Marine Corps enterprise pay, personnel, accounting and financial management systems to include Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS), Marine Online, Marine Corps Orders Resource System (MCORS), Standards Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS), and the Marine Corps Financial Integrated Analysis System (MCFIAS). The TSO also provides complete SDLC activities for these systems as well as development of the Navy, Air Guard, and Air Force Reserve Order Writing Systems. The TSO is implementing the Marine Corp's SABRS application to the Department of the Navy.\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT - MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY:  The Professional Development Program develops, delivers, and evaluates Professional Military Education (PME) and training through resident and distance education programs to prepare leaders to meet the challenges of the national security environment. The .edu expansion provides wireless connectivity, information sharing, and audio visual capabilities in support of Education Command's effort to modernize PME. Having .edu networks at all of the Marine Corp University campuses creates the opportunity for courses to collaborate, conduct research, wargame, and conduct video teleconferencing.\n\nMARINE CORPS WARGAMING CAPABILITY: MARINE CORPS WARGAMING CAPABILITY: Wargaming Capability facilitates Force\nDesign through the assessment and evaluation of current Operation Plans, Concepts of Operations, future operational and functional concepts, and operational and technology-based approaches. Wargaming Capability results are used to develop, assess, and refine future operational and functional concepts across the full range of military operations (ROMO); inform requirements generation decisions; assess capability investments; guide capability resource actions; inform the POM development; and provide education and leadership development. Wargaming Capability efforts include prototyping with an emphasis on identifying appropriate technologies and directing cyber security support for initiatives to boost information assurance, network configuration, security control validation, and type accreditation across the material solution.\n\n[P40A \/ Laptop Refresh]: Laptop, Technical Refresh\n\n[P40A \/ Marine Corps Wargaming Capability]: Wargaming capability efforts are focused within multiple areas to include identifying, defining, and documenting requirements and capabilities; directing cyber security support for initiatives to boost information assurance in the areas of modeling & simulation, network configuration, security control validation, and type accreditation; development of performance specifications; and modeling and simulation prototyping efforts.  The wargaming capability facilitates the assessment and evaluation of operating and functional concepts, operational and technology-based approaches, current concepts of operations, and principles and methods that inform decisions in support of force development and requirements generation.

The equipment procured under this cost element will be replacing outdated equipment that is no longer receiving security patches or updates from the vendor, increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the Marine Corps Enterprise Network on the SIPR side.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a result of not receiving cybersecurity updates which will lead to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  Funding within this cost element will enable the Marine Corps to replace these aging network devices with ones that are compliant with current cybersecurity standards which will enable users across the Marine Corps to continue to operate without network disruptions.",

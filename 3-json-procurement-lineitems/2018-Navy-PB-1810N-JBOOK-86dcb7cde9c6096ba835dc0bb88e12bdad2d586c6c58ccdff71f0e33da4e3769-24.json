            "val": "Funding in this P-1 line provides Non-Propulsion Electronics equipment that will be installed aboard TRIDENT Class submarines as part of the Obsolete Equipment Replacement (OER) Program.\n\nOER Program is the replacement of existing hardware\/software that, though functional, has become operationally obsolete, is no longer in production or supportable with spare parts, or has a high failure rate making them no longer cost effective to maintain.  OER hardware\/software changes are expected to provide significant cost savings via reduced maintenance costs and use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology wherever possible as long as all technical requirements are met.\n\nThis funding line includes performance of the required fully integrated system level testing and certification of changes to the TRIDENT Combat systems prior to installation of the changes on the ship.  Integrated testing and certification provides assurance that when the changes are installed in the ship, the TRIDENT Combat system will operate as designed, allowing the ships to maintain their operational schedules and mission capabilities.\n\n[P40A \/ CCS Revision Engineering Cert\/Test]: This program develops upgrades to legacy systems to maintain required interface connectivity to other Program Acquisition Resource Manager (PARM)-managed subsystems in response to PARMs modernizations, or to address obsolescence, or where mandated requirement changes (example Cyber security) drive changes to hardware or software."

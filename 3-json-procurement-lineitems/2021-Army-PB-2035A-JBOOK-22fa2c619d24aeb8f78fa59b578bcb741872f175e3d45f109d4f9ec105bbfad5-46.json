            "val": "This budget line funds two separate programs.  One program supports Float and the other program supports Rail.\n\nArmy Watercraft Systems (AWS) support Dynamic Force Repositioning (DFR) and provides the Combatant and Multi-Domain Task Force Commander with organic waterborne lift capability that can deliver today's Army maneuver platforms and equipment, and supply bulk fuel and water across the full spectrum of operations with increased speed and lower draft; and mitigates anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) threat by providing access to shallow coastal waters, rivers, in narrow inland waterways in support of dispersed force elements in austere environments and where mature ports or road networks are unavailable.  The procurement of items less $5.0M (material and\/or hardware for modifications) is critical to the success of the Army's Watercraft Transformation Strategy (AWTS) and fulfillment of the AWS Title 10 mission. \n\nIn general, all Army Watercraft funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner to preserve the Combatant Commanders requirement of \"freedom of seas\" access in all areas of the world particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.\n\nArmy Watercraft Systems are categorized under Landing Craft, Towing and Terminal Operations, Ship-to-Shore Enablers and Watercraft Operations Support. Landing Craft consist of Logistic Support Vessels (LSV), Landing Craft Utility 2000 (LCU-2000), Landing Craft Mechanized 8 (LCM-8) MOD 1, and LCM-8 MOD 2 (Watercraft Operations Support). Towing and Terminal Operations consist of Large Tug 800 (LT-800), Small Tug 900 (ST-900), and Barge Derrick Crane 115-ton (BD-115). Ship-to-Shore Enablers consist of Modular Causeway Systems (MCS) [each MCS includes Roll-On\/Roll-Off Discharge Facilities (RRDF), Modular Warping Tugs (MWT), Causeway Ferry (CF), Floating Causeway (FC)].  Security Patrol Boats intercept and divert vessels that have strayed outside the public channel into restricted waters.\n\nFor the Rail program, railroad equipment consists of locomotives, rolling stock, railway passenger cars, track maintenance equipment, etc., used to support Army ammunition plants, Army Materiel Command (AMC) depots, Installation Management Command (IMCOM), Forces Command (FORSCOM) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) installations in peacetime, training and mobilization missions. This Railway Equipment is procured for the replacement of locomotives and railway cars that have exceeded their economic useful life (65 years) and have become logistically unsupportable and costly to maintain.  This equipment is in some cases already unserviceable and in other cases, either unsafe or not cleared for use under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Funding was provided in FY19 to procure shop equipment and tools to assist in the Army's move of its railroad locomotive overhaul facility, the Defense Generator & Rail Center from Hill, AFB, UT to Anniston Army Depot, AL. \n\nLocomotive procurement consists of commercial off-the-shelf GENSET switcher locomotives in direct support of the Army Rail Modernization Program. The program mandates systematic replacement of an aging fleet, that for the respective installations are becoming increasingly more costly to maintain. The GENSET Locomotives are industry proven, state of the art technology that will position the Army to meet current EPA air quality restrictions, and future fuel economy mandates. The procurement of railway cars is to meet TDA shortages at various Army installations as well as to replace aging assets that have exceeded their economic useful life.\n\nComments: In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestics emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.844 million supports Army Watercraft Systems for material and\/or hardware for modifications to maintain readiness, correct safety discrepancies, increase interoperability, maintain useful life, improve supportability, increase efficiency, meet new and changing statutory and regulatory requirements. FY 2021 Base procurement dollars also support Program Management Support which includes Program Management Matrix support and System Engineering oversight required to manage the program and provide contractor oversight. Matrix salaries, travel, personnel training and other government costs are included for retaining a professional acquisition workforce."

            "val": "This budget line provides funding for modernization, construction and rehabilitation efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) and commercial facilities as well as preservation of inactive production lines at the AAPs.  The AAPs were constructed during World War II;  the facilities have served and supported numerous theater operations, providing the warfighter with expansive ammunition requirements.  Due to their age, the facilities and infrastructure experience frequent failures, and the production lines operate with outdated technology processes and equipment.  The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line consists of three separate programs, Provision of Industrial Facilities (PIF), Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) and Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF).  Its mission includes replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrades to infrastructures.  This line represents an enduring, exhaustive mission to modernize and equip the Army's Ammunition Plants and provide decisive advantage of the warfighter's conventional ammunition, explosives and propellant requirements, without delay and at optimal cost.  Project Director (PD) Joint Services, under Joint Program Executive Office Armaments and Ammunition, manages the Industrial Facilities budget line.\n\nThe Provision of Industrial Facilities program (PIF), SSN EP1200, establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants.  It also addresses emergency modernization and associated construction to mitigate production disruptions at various sites.  \n\nThis budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations including the Quad City Cartridge Case Facility (QCCCF) and Government-Owned, Government-Operated AAPs, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities, SSN EP2000.  Funding will also support consolidation of layaway production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Layaway efforts also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Layaway program also includes safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.\n\nProcurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF), SSN EP1500, to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements at GOCO and GOGO AAPs and QCCCF.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support."

            "val": "FY 2021 procurement dollars in the amount of $592.224 million will support modernization projects to include modernization upgrades to the small caliber, Next Generation Squad Weapon ammunition production facility at Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (AAP) and construction of a new long range precision artillery production facility at Iowa AAP.  Funds also support modernization projects to expand the annual production capacity of Research Development Explosive (RDX) at Holston AAP from approximately eight million pounds to fifteen million.  Efforts include construction of the third Area B Acid Train and construction of a nitration facility.  Funds also support infrastructure upgrades at Holston, Iowa, Lake City, Radford, and Scranton AAPs, and work environment projects, improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will provide engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects.\n\nFY 2021 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that is no longer required for current production but must be retained for future production needs.  Funds support the decontamination and demolition of excess production equipment and facilities buildings at Radford and Milan Army Ammunition Plant and Pine Bluff Arsenal.\n\nFY 2021 funding supports the care and maintenance of layaway equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations.\n\n\nThe P-25s are under review."

The lack of properly engineered and installed dry air system to eliminate atmospheric air entering the head space of these SNA tanks has caused corrosion problems on the SNA tanks.  If a tank failed, it could cause a shortage of SNA.  The SNA tanks also lack adequate storage capacity.

Holston AAP requires expansion of the Acetic Acid and Acetic Anhydride production capacity which is utilized in the nitration of hexamine to crude for RDX and HMX.

Smaller precision-manufactured parts require tighter tolerances and increased reliability.  The new facility will reduce inspection cycle time, improved throughput and analyze large amounts of dimensional data to reduce production costs.  The new facility will be approximately 5,800 square feet and will also contain new tool and die operations.  This effort also includes associated infrastructure support upgrades.

Project includes sixty-five percent design efforts to support the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) Ammunition production facility at Lake City AAP.  Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) Armaments and Ammunition is the agency lead for the development of a new squad weapon ammunition round to increase soldier lethality.  Lake City AAP was identified as the production site for the NGSW round due to its existing ammunition production support infrastructure and its ability to retain highly qualified, expert small caliber ammunition manufacturing personnel.  The project also establishes a Prototype Energetic Center (PEC) at Lake City AAP to conduct manufacturing studies and testing to strengthen the new ammunition round effectiveness.  The project objective is to meet full rate production of the NSGW round by FY 2025.\n\nFY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $40.000 million supports modernization, purchase and installation of equipment for the NGSW Ammunition facility at Lake City AAP.  The facility will be capable of producing three new, 6.8mm NGSW ammunition rounds that will provide munitions overmatch for the joint warfighter.  Effort includes facility construction, infrastructure improvements, and equipment procurement, as well as engineering and project management support from the Corps of Engineers."

These components are required to support proof and acceptance testing at ATC and Yuma Test Center YTC. Without these components, the Army will be unable to conduct the testing required to accept ammunition end items into its inventory and to mitigate operational risk due to ammunition shortfalls across the Army.\n\nAt ATC, continues replacement and procurement for Weapon and Weapon Components which have experienced wear and tear during repetitive testing of production ammunition items. Typical purchases include: rifle\/carbine\/machine gun barrels, receivers, and parts; large caliber barrels; small and medium caliber Mann-type test barrels, mortar barrels and bipod\/baseplates.  Timely replacement of worn or unserviceable weapons\/components will permit test execution without delays for acquisition of supporting equipment.\n\nAt YTC, procures Ammo Components to continue support Production Acceptance Test (PAT) of artillery and mortar ammunition components at YTC throughout the year.  Also procures replacement parts for large and small caliber direct fire weapon systems for production based support, which will improve weapon reliability and reduce potential testing downtime if sudden repairs are needed.\n\nThis project increases test efficiencies and decreases costs and risks to Army Program Managers."

Various system enhancements have been identified that improve the use of this weapon system. Improved components include a collapsible buttstock, bipod, drop-in mount cradle and 200-round ammunition pack. Other items being procured to enhance Soldier performance include design modifications to the lightweight ground mount and standard\/short barrels.  The M197 Vehicle Mount is the current interface used to mount the M249 SAW and M240B Medium Machine Gun to most vehicle platforms. A system improvement (drop in mount cradle) adds a link\/spent case deflector and ammo handling system to provide capability upgrades addressing issues that Soldiers have been identified as shortcomings of the current system. The M192 is the primary ground mount for the M240B\/L and M249 machine guns. Based on recent combat experience, improvements are required to address identified shortcomings in the design and to enhance operational performance."

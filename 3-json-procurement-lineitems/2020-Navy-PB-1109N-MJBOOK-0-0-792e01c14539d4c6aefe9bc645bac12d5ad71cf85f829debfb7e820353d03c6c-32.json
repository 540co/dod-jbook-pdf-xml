            "val": "Motor Transport Modifications funds numerous essential modifications, initiatives, and new vehicle procurements that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, safety, availability, and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life-cycle management and allows USMC to develop and implement improvements, as needed, to respond to the evolving requirements of the Marine Corps and sustain the fleet.\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) - The MTVR is the Marine Corps' medium ground lift capability supporting all elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  With its 70% off-road mission profile and the addition of a highly survivable armor package, the MTVR is heavily used in contingency operations as well as missions supporting humanitarian operations.  It has a payload of 7.1 tons off-road and 15 tons on-road, a high-performance suspension, traction control, central tire inflation system, and automatic transmission, to transport personnel, ammunition, bulk cargo, and\/or bulk fuel and water in a variety of environments.  The MTVR family of vehicles includes a cargo variant (both standard and extended wheel base configurations), a dump truck, a wrecker, a tractor and a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) Rocket Resupply System Vehicle. This program funds numerous product improvements to the MTVR via engineering change proposals (ECPs), resulting from post-production requirements in Force Protection, Communications, on-board Situational Awareness, and improved fuel efficiency required across the Range of Military Operations, as well as addressing  product quality deficiencies and other issues that impact vehicle safety, reliability, availability and readiness.   The requirements capability change to improve Fuel Efficiency for the MTVR is part of the program's initiatives to lower fuel consumption and extend the vehicle's cruising range, while lowering operating costs over the life of the MTVR.       \n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV): Provides Warfighters multi-mission platforms capable of mitigating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats. Multiple MRAP vehicle Categories (CATs) have been procured, fielded, and are now being sustained, such as the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV), with combat operations (OPS) in rural, mountainous, and urban terrain.  Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance. Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle. Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal. Funding includes required Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)\/subsystems and ECP\/Capability Insertion in response to an UUNS and Warfighter safety and survivability requirements.\n\nP-19 Replacement (P-19R): Vehicles are replacing the obsolete A\/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle is outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment.  It provides rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19R may also be employed to fight structural fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.\n  \nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: The LVSR is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Heavy Lift Capability system. The LVSR is built on the Oshkosh TAC-4 fully independent suspension, allowing it to traverse a variety of challenging terrain while carrying a payload of up to 22.5 tons. The LVSR accomplishes a variety of tactical logistics missions using armored and unarmored cargo tractor and recovery variants. Funding provides for modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as updated brackets and cables for warfighter systems such as legacy Blue Force Tracker upgraded to Joint Battle Command Platform and CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer upgraded to CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer V2.  These modifications also include critical safety upgrades, which include the brake corrosion modification, which prevents brake failure due to submersion in water during fording, boat and bridge operations, and improved blast seats that reduce occupant injury during IED strikes.  Finally, modifications include life cycle issues such as cab reconditioning, parts obsolescence and life cycle cost reductions.\n\nMotor Transport Modification (MTM) - Light Tactical Family of Vehicles (FoV) -  Modification program funds numerous essential modifications, initiatives, and new vehicle procurements that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper sustainment and life-cycle management of the light tactical vehicle fleet and allows the program office to develop and implement improvements, as needed, to respond to the evolving requirements of the Marine Corps."

Funding for these programs were realigned to BLI 5050 beginning in FY19 to centralize modification funding for USMC tactical vehicles.\n\nFY 2018 Base Appropriation Request: $23.372M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $7.477M; Integration of ECP Kits for installation on over 300 MTVRs.  Funding supported the procurements of calibration technologies that were transitioned to the Marine Corps from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capability initiative to improve the MTVR's fuel efficiency to begin installing on the MTVR armored fleet during FY19.\n\nMotor Transport Modifications (MTM) $3.598M; Funding provided for the implementation of the fleet service life extension initiatives, vehicles, quality deficiency resolutions, safety initiatives, transparent armor re-lamination and environmental\/state transportation mandated vehicle changes. Provided support for ECP integration to include addressing deficiencies of HMMWV vehicles due to up armoring and age degradation of the fleet, testing and fielding efforts for hosted systems i.e. C4I, weapons, and intel that use light tactical vehicles as their base transportation mode.  \n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: $12.105M; $.192M Reserve.  Funding provided for various modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as for the integration of brackets and cables for warfighter systems, and for critical safety upgrades, including the brake corrosion ECP and the armored door lock improvements.  These upgrades addressed issues that affect user safety, life cycle issues, obsolescence, and ultimately, life cycle cost reductions.  \n\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $11.392M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $7.147M; In FY19, MTVR has a three-tier integration effort that spans across Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Marine Augmentation Program-Kuwait (MAP-K) and the Marine Forces-Reserve (MFR), for procuring and installing several required Modifications. These modification upgrades improve the ability of the Marine to \"shoot, move, and communicate\" by prioritizing the installation of the C4I (command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence) systems, upgrading the weapons mount kit, as well as the front and rear cab axle mounts that are required due to the addition of heavy armor.  Additionally, installation of the Turret Gunner Restraint System (TGRS) provides rollover protection for the Marine in the turret using a full-body, six-point harness.  \n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: $3.080M; $.215M Reserve.  Provides for modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as updated brackets and cables for warfighter systems such as legacy Blue Force Tracker upgraded to Joint Battle Command Platform and CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer upgraded to CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer V2.  These modifications also include critical safety upgrades which include the brake corrosion modification which prevents brake failure due to submersion in water during fording, boat and bridge operations, and improved blast seats that reduce occupant injury during IED strikes.  Finally, modifications include life cycle issues such as cab reconditioning, parts obsolescence and life cycle cost reductions. \n\nP-19 Replacement: $.218M.022M Reserves.  Funding will provide initial support, training, Spares and FSRs for Reserves' vehicles. Funding in FY19 and out reflects P-19R vehicles previously in BLI 5006.  \n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of vehicles (FoV): $0.710M Funds ECP upgrades\/modifications for the enduring MRAP vehicle requirement.  Continues ECP Upgrades and Modifications to maintain vehicle relevancy in meeting force protection threats, such as blast, rollover or water submersion events, and responding to operational needs. Funding in FY19 and out reflects MRAP previously in BLI 6520.\n\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $19.234M\n\nMotor Transport Modifications (MTM) $.542M; Funding will provide for limited quality deficiency resolutions and safety initiatives.  Provides the USMC portion of an engineering change proposal and associated technical manual updates that addresseperformance and safety deficiencies from the HMMWV family of vehicles operating in excess of the gross vehicle weight rating.  The increase of $.542M from FY19 to FY20 restores funding in FY20 to support vehicle safety and reliability modifications\/ECPs.\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $14.501M; In FY20, MTVR's will continue to have a three-tier integration effort to meet approved operational requirements that span across Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Marine Augmentation Program-Kuwait (MAP-K) and the Marine Forces-Reserve (MFR), for procuring and installing several types of modification kits. These modification upgrades improve the ability of the crew to \"shoot, move, and communicate\" by prioritizing the installation of the C4I (command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence) systems, upgrading the weapons mount kit to enable the employment of heavy machine guns, as well as the front and rear cab axle mounts that are required due to the addition of heavy armor.  C4I kits enable the platform to accept Radios, Intercoms, Jammers and Blue Force Situational Awareness capabilities. Additionally, installation of the Turret Gunner Restraint System (TGRS) provides rollover protection for the Marine in the turret using a full-body, six-point harness.  The increase of $7.354M between FY19 and FY20 is due to the cost of vehicle and ECP modification upgrades that are planned for procurement and installation in FY20; installation costs account for over half the total cost of each ECP.  \n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) $.742M. Will procure ECP upgrades\/modifications for the enduring MRAP vehicle requirement.  Continues ECP upgrades and Modifications to maintain relevancy in meeting force protection threats, such as blast, rollover or water submersion events, and responding to operational needs. The increase of $.032M from FY19 to FY20 is the result of support of ECP upgrades.\n\nP-19 Replacement (P-19R) $.179M; $.183M Reserve. Will procure engineering change proposals (ECPs), such as lightening arrestors. The increase of $.122M from FY19 to FY20 is the result of such ECPs to the new vehicle.\n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) $2.855M; $.232M Reserve. Will procure modified cabs which prevents deadlining the vehicle due to corrosion and modified seats to sustain the current level of performance of LVSR during IED strikes. The decrease of $.208M from FY19 to FY20 is the result of completion of LVSR door lock ECP.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2019 OCO Appropriation Request: $44.440M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $18.001M; OCO funded procurement and installation of various ECP kits required for the MTVRs located in the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Augmentation Program-Kuwait (MAP-K), and other Marine units.  The ECP Kits included the C4ISR kits which provide cabling and bracketry for the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P) and Counter IED Systems (CVRJ); Rear Cab Mounts, Front Cab Mounts, the Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) and the Emergency Egress Window (EEW).  These kits increase the overall survivability, safety and the Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities of the MTVR Armored Family of Vehicles.\n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement: (LVSR): $.519M OCO.  Will fund procurement and installation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), such as brake safety, JBC-P and counter IED Systems, CVRJs needed for the LVSRs located in the MAP-K. These kits increase force protection of all LVSR variants by ensuring the vehicles have updated ECPs to increase braking capability, navigation and counter IED threats.\n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV): $25.920M OCO. Funds the installation of Egress kits procured in response to UUNS 08275UC and 10215UC; MARCENT Enduring requirements.

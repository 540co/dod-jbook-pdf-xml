        "Description": {
            "val": "ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEM Lifecycle replacement and upgrade of digital acoustic measurement systems used to collect data used to build gridded data bases of layered geoacoustic descriptions of the ocean floor and low frequency bottom loss databases, collect fleet anti-submarine warfare support measurements, produce high resolution anti-submarine warfare area assessment products, and serve to provide critical environmental input to fleet acoustic transmission loss models. System consists of multi-channel variable depth buoys, shipboard data acquisition, control, and processing support systems. Buoys acquire the data, provide signal conditioning and gain, and store the data in digital form. \n\nACOUSTIC POSITIONING SYSTEM (ULTRA SHORT BASELINE (USBL)) The Acoustic Positioning System (APS) is an Ultra Short Baseline (USBL) Acoustic Positioning System used to provide high accuracy navigation and location of towed bodies and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) deployed from T-AGS 60 oceanographic survey vessels. The APS is permanently installed aboard each vessel and supports tracking objects in any direction out to a 5000m radius. In addition, it is used to precisely locate lost vehicles or instrumentation for purposes of recovery. Current navigation techniques can be inaccurate as they rely on approximations resulting in imprecise location data and degraded environmental data. This can lead to a substantially increased processing time and increased risk of missed coverage. With the ability of APS to determine accurate location data, the cost, practicality, and search time to recover a lost vehicle is substantially reduced. \n\nCROSS DOMAIN SOLUTION (CDS) Meteorology and Atmospheric data is a highly perishable, mission-essential element in planning for almost all operational missions performed by the United States Navy. Excessive time delays in dissemination of oceanographic and meteorological products\/services may add significant risk to our operational forces. This CDS provides a mechanism by which oceanographic and meteorological products\/services can be disseminated to DoD end users on the SIPRNET as it is collected and produced.\n\nDEEP MULTIBEAM INSTALLATION The full ocean multibeam sonar system is the primary ocean mapping tool in greater than 300 meters of water to full ocean. The deep-water multibeam system will be a state-of-the-art commercial one by one degree multibeam having a maximum swath coverage of six times water depth. The survey system includes an integrated deep water sub-bottom profiler system. The system will be installed on all T-AGS 60 class ships as a life-cycle replacement for the existing deep water multibeam system which has exceeded its life expectancy and will no longer be supported by the manufacturer. Multibeam systems collect deep-water bathymetry data required to support special chart production for the Navy. \n\nDIGITAL SIDE SCAN SONAR (SHIP) Additional high-speed, high resolution side scan sonar systems are required to meet fleet requirements supporting mine warfare operations. The intended system procured will be installed aboard USNS HENSON and additional T-AGS 60 class ships to replicate the system aboard USNS HEEZEN. The procurement will facilitate simultaneous collection of high resolution imagery at mine warfare resolutions and frequencies. The imagery data is required to generate products that directly support mine warfare, hydrographic and oceanographic requirements. Side scan sonar data is critical for the detection of small mine-like targets as well as hazards-to-navigation (e.g. wrecks) and characterizing the sea-floor over large areas (geoprovincing). This data is fundamental to execute MIW change-detection doctrine comparing historical data to current data to determine mine-threats. \n\nFLEET SURVEY TEAM INTEGRATED SURVEY PLATFORM Purchases transportable hydrographic survey platform systems used for rapid response, contingency, and emergent high-priority survey requirements. The platform is 7-9 meter air-transportable survey boat (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) type) with installed and fukky-integrated Multibeam Echo-Sounder RESON 7125, Single Beam Echo-Sounder, Digital Side Scan Sonar, Wide-Area Differential Global Positioning System navigation, Inertial Motion sensor system, Data Acquisition Work-Station (PC), Sound Velocity Probe, and Electric winch. The boat and trailer are designed for transport in a C-130 aircraft and rigged for hoisting.  \n\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY LAUNCH (HSL) MISSION EQUIPMENT This OPN line item involves the life-cycle replacement of the entire mission equipment suite currently installed aboard the operational fleet of HSL (seven HSLs and the Bertram). The mission equipment suite includes, but is not limited to, shallow water multibeam systems, single beam systems, navigation systems, data collection and storage systems, forward-looking sonar systems, and digital side scan systems. This does not include high-resolution digital side scan systems used for mine warfare. Life-cycle replacement of these systems is critical to ensure state-of-the-art hydrographic surveying capability in littoral areas. Also, due to the harsh environmental conditions encountered by HSLs during typical hydrographic surveys, planned replacement of their mission equipment is necessary to guarantee long-term supportability.\n \nINTEGRATED SUB-BOTTOM PROFILER These systems are life cycle replacements for existing Sub Bottom Profiler systems that have exceeded life expectancy and do not currently provide high resolution digital acoustic data with precision positioning and navigational capability that is required for Mine Warfare missions. Systems will operate in conjunction with the new deep-water multibeam systems that were installed in FY15. \n \nLITTORAL BATTLESPACE SENSING, FUSION, AND INTEGRATION (LBSF&I) supports ocean sensing and data collection and the integration of that data into a common environmental picture. Funding supports procurement of a technology infrastructure capability designed to fuse and integrate data collected under this program with extant static and dynamic data to produce the best available and most accurate battle space environmental characterization used to deliver decision superiority and information dominance to the combatant commander. \n\nLONG TERM AMBIENT NOISE RECORDING AND REPORTING SYSTEM Long Term Ambient Noise Recording and Reporting System is a moored, acoustic buoy system used to support ISR missions. The buoys are four channel Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS) units that will record ambient noise for long time periods within an 8kHz bandwidth. The Environmental Acoustic Recording System buoys will have to be recovered for data processing. \n\nMASTER CLOCK SYSTEMS These systems consist of: Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning systems to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls. These systems will allow for more rapid, robust and autonomous characterization of the Rubidium Fountains and Hydrogen Masers in the timing ensemble at United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Rb fountain clocks deliver the precise time and time interval required to support GPS III requirements and national assets. \n \nOCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (OIS) ARCHITECTURE The Oceanographic Information System (OIS) architecture provides the corporate information technology infrastructure to enable the collection, processing, storage, archival, retrieval, and dissemination of oceanographic data, products, and other scientific information delivering Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) superiority to the Fleet. Funds life cycle support and technology refresh to upgrade the end-to-end processing and production systems. Deployment of new state-of-the-art oceanographic sensors, such as high-speed, high-resolution digital side scan sonar systems, collect data volumes far in excess of the current OIS capability to receive, process, store, and archive data. The integration of Fleet through-the-sensor data into OIS production and the collection of remotely sensed data add to the complexity of the technology infrastructure required for OIS. Upgrades to existing corporate storage resources that support the data warehouse and expand the storage area network to meet anticipated data storage requirements are included. The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS) FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.\n\nPNN41 - PORTABLE MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT Portable Multibeam Sonar System is a roll-on\/roll-off life cycle replacement for the RESON 8101 (4 systems) and the RESON 8125 (1 system). These systems provide the means to rapidly deploy a multibeam capability onto a craft of opportunity in order to support emergent naval requirements. Portability is key to enable rapid response to urgent or short-fused demands. The new systems provide an increase in survey efficiency, reduced maintenance costs, and an improvement in data quality. The Portable Multibeam Sonar System that replaces the RESON 8125 will provide high-resolution swath bathymetry along with side scan sonar imaging capability. This system will provide bottom imagery to facilitate MIW route surveys and navigation hazard surveys. \n\nPRIMARY OCEAN PREDICTION SYSTEM (POPS) ENHANCEMENTS Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global Meteorological and Oceanographic Command (METOC) support of the fleet. POPS-Met operates within a 24\/7 reachback operations center supporting global fleet operations with weather and ocean prediction products and warfighting applications that are critical to fleet safety and warfighting effectiveness. POPS-Met provides the technology and infrastructure to sustain global operations ashore and afloat by providing timely, relevant, 24\/7 METOC data and products to the fleet, Department of Defense, joint, allied, and coalition warfighters at all classification levels. POPS-Met acquires and sustains the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) environments to provide most of the assured METOC forecast products and services for Tier 1 of the Battlespace on Demand, which originate directly from the METOC models, satellite processing software, and applications. Tier 1 also provides input to many of the Battlespace on Demand Tier 2 and Tier 3 Products. Ongoing technology refreshment is required to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly in response to greater emphasis on preparation for and response to regional conflicts, and the greater data volume from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and future remotely sensed environmental data sources. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reachback customer support. Together, these enhancements will provide the Fleet with more accurate and responsive environmental support across all three Tiers of Battlespace on Demand. The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.\n\nSHARC-REMUS ACOMM SYSTEM The SHARC-REMUS ACOMM System (SRAS) is an Acoustic Positioning System (APS) which provides high accuracy navigation and location of Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The APS is installed aboard a Sensor Housing Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARC), a long-duration Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that utilizes wave energy for propulsion and solar panels for energy replenishment of core systems and sensors. The SHARC, equipped with the SRAS, functions as a Communications and Navigation Aid (CNA) to the submerged REMUS AUV by means of acoustic signaling. Working in tandem with the AUV, the SHARC SRAS eliminates the need for the REMUS AUV to come to the surface for routine communications and navigation fix updates. The AUV maintains a submerged posture, while the SRAS provides updates to its navigational position, and allows over-the-horizon communications for sending back AUV position and status messages, snippets of sidescan and bathymetric data and subsequent redirection of the AUV. Current submerged AUV navigation techniques can be inaccurate as they rely on approximations resulting in imprecise location data and degraded environmental data, and require the AUVs to surface for frequent navigational fixes. This can lead to a substantially increased processing time and increased risk of missed coverage. \n\nSHIP MOVING VESSEL PROFILER (MVP)The Shipboard MVP is the larger shipboard complement to the HSL MVP. Intended for use from T-AGS 60 platforms, the system consists of a compact and recoverable probe integrated with a computer controlled over-the-side handling system. It permits the rapid and automated acquisition of sound velocity profile data from an underway vessel and significantly increases multibeam survey efficiency by acquiring highly accurate automated sound velocity profile data in the critical 0- 400m water layer.\n \nSHIP TO SHORE DATA COMMUNICATIONS The Ship to Shore Data Communications system provides high-speed digital data communication between survey ships and the NAVOCEANO Survey Operations Center at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, using either C-band or Ku-band satellites. Real-time survey data is delivered to Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) or Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) computers for rapid processing to produce near real-time products for the war fighter. Data is transmitted from ship to shore at nominal rate of 1,024,000 bits per second and from shore to ship at a nominal rate of 256,000 bits per second. The system also provides the survey ship with classified and unclassified email and Voice-over-IP communication. This is the sole capability which allows rapid turnaround of survey data to support the warfighter in today's highly-compressed warfighting scenarios. Life cycle OPN replacements were programmed starting in FY11.\n \nTIME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM Time is distributed via telephone, modem, Global Positioning System (GPS), Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). Funding is for distribution systems necessary to transfer and distribute time to users. This consists of receivers systems for M Code receiver systems, Two Way Satellite Time Transfer systems, Precise Time and Time Interval measuring systems, Critical Time Dissemination (CTD), NextGen Secure TWSTT, and other systems to distribute precise time. \n\nVERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY SYSTEM Systems to be purchased here are antennas, radio receivers, Radio Frequency to digital conversion systems, wide band communication systems, and correlators to process wide-band data obtained at sites separated by thousands of kilometers. Very Long Baseline Interferometry data monitors variations in the Earth's orientation and form the basis for the fundamental celestial reference frame, and supports DoD and national requirements for Space Situational Awareness. \n\nAIRBORNE LIDAR SYSTEM The Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR (CZMIL) replaces the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system. CZMIL is an aircraft mounted LIDAR system used to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Routine life cycle replacement maintains technology refresh, precludes obsolescence of equipment and repair parts\/maintenance, and maintains survey reliability. \n\nDEEP MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT The full ocean multibeam sonar system is the primary ship-mounted ocean mapping tool used for surveys in water depths greater than 300 meters to full ocean. The deep-water multibeam system is a state-of-the-art, commercial, one-by-one degree system with a maximum swath coverage of six times water depth. The multibeam survey system includes an integrated deep water sub-bottom profiler system. The system will be installed on all T-AGS 60 class ships as a life-cycle replacement for the existing deep water multibeam system (EM121A). The deep water multibeam system (EM121A) has exceeded its life expectancy and will no longer be supported by the manufacturer. Multibeam systems collect deep-water bathymetry data required to support special chart production for the Navy. If the deep-water multibeam systems are not replaced, the T-AGS 60 ships will lose the capability to support the Navy's requirement for deep and mid-water bathymetry data products. \n\nSHALLOW WATER MULTIBEAM The shallow water multibeam sonar system is the primary sea-floor mapping system in the littoral (50-500 meters of water). Without this data: 1) surface and sub-surface littoral navigation charts would not be updated with accurate, high resolution bathymetry, 2) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running ocean (currents, waves, tides) models supporting anti-submarine warfare, naval special warfare and mine warfare applications would not be available and 3) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running acoustic models for anti-submarine warfare would not be available.\n \nSHALLOW WATER SEISMIC SYSTEM Lifecycle replacement and upgrades to seismic systems are needed to meet existing requirements for geophysical measurements in shallow to mid-depth water environments. The systems will be roll-on\/roll-off systems and consist of a sub-bottom profiler for medium to deep sub-bottom measurements. These systems are designed to meet requirements for geophysical measurements to support geophysical database construction. These databases are an essential part of acoustic prediction systems and support to ASW mission planning, execution, and prosecution.\n\nNAVY PRECISION OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER SYSTEM The Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) at Anderson Mesa, Arizona is operationally producing a catalog of the precision positions of stars at a level of 16 Milli-arcseconds (mas) to meet DoD requirements for Celestial Reference Frame maintenance. NASA has transferred to the Navy four 1.8 meter telescopes to be added to the NPOI array in order to extend the catalog to fainter stars of 9th magnitude and expand the size and density of the catalog. OPN systems to be procured include precise optical and electronic equipment and infrastructure equipment used to integrate the 1.8m telescopes into NPOI array.\n\nA2 Enterprise Virtualization GIG-Node Meteorology and Atmospheric data is a highly perishable, mission-essential element in planning for almost all operational missions performed by the United States Navy. Significant time delays in dissemination of oceanographic and meteorological products\/services may add significant risk to our operational forces. This Enterprise A2 Virtualized GIG-Node will provide automatic-failover for key oceanographic and meteorological product\/services in the event of a significant system\/site outage.\n\nTASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO data architecture allows for distribution and processing of Precise Time, Astrometry, and Earth Orientation parameters across DoD.  Funding is for a secure network environment equipment.  This consists of switches and servers for a secure scientific network as well as switches and servers for testing of new software and products.\n\nAdvanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) provides an automated and efficient system capability at both Fleet Weather Centers (FWCs) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).  This system will leverage existing Navy and National Weather Service (NWS)modeling and forecast automation capabilities that will be compatible across government and civilian weather forecasting sectors. This system will analyze, interrogate, and display ensemble\/deterministic models, satellite, observations, and automate repetitive forecaster tasks.  These capabilities are necessary for the commands to support mission areas including, but that are not limited to, maritime operations, aviation operations, fleet operations, and safety of navigation.\n\nPrecise Time and Astrometry Network (PTA Network) (previously funded 10OPNW TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO) is the network supporting the Master Clock at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and the Alternate Master Clock (AMC) located in Colorado Springs, CO.  The time derived from USNO, known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC (USNO)) is the primary time reference for the Department of Defense.  The network also supports USNO's determination of the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) as well as Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP).  Together, this data provides essential mission critical information for navigation, orientation, targeting and weapons guidance, tracking of space-based platforms, and identification of space objects.  Task Force Cyber Awakening (TFCA) was established to comprehensively address cyber security across the entire Navy cyber platform.  The USNO was funded to remediate critical cyber security vulnerabilities on USNO networks, to include the PTA Network.  Funding is for equipment modernization necessary to maintain the required security posture and ensure the resiliency of the PTA Network, which is of strategic importance for the execution of tactical operations.  The PTA Network is composed of one network unit with ground sites in Washington, D.C., Colorado Springs, CO, and Flagstaff, AZ.\n\n[P40A \/ Time Distribution System]: Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) - Time Distribution System: The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) provides the common time reference for all of the DOD per CJCSI 6130.01E.  USNO's primary site in Washington, DC can provide Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services to the EUCOM AOR over both Ka- and X-band satellites.  USNO's Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB, CO cannot reach the EUCOM AOR with TWSTT services.

            "val": "1.4 Fleet Survey: In FY13 2 boats were funded at a total of $1.680M.  The FY18 requests 1 boat for $0.870M.  The boats (including survey equipment) are procured based on the life cycle replacement (LCR) plan to ensure they are safe, reliable in OCONUS operating environments, and provide the necessary functionality in order to meet mission requirements at the present time. The optimal replacement time or lifecycle replacement plan is not a precise moment but is used to factor in factory warranty expirations, large maintenance costs, downtime costs, obsolesces of parts, and increased fuel consumption based on changing technologies.\n\nCurrently, Fleet Survey Team (FST) maintains four different survey platforms, which are used to conduct shallow water surveys in order to adhere to the Oceanographic, Hydrographic, and Bathymetric (OHB) requirements.  Based on FST's lifecycle replacement (LCR) plan, they need to be procured every few years in pairs due to price breaks, equipment deterioration, and other factors used to develop the LCR.  FST Platforms provide OHB data in OCONUS littoral waters. The survey mission areas are prioritized and directed by Combatant Commanders annually with subsequent changes based on emergent real world requirements. FST maintains four different survey platforms, which are used to conduct shallow water surveys in order to adhere to the OHB requirements.  \n\n1.8 - Master Clock\n\nThese systems consist of: Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning systems to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls. These systems will allow for more rapid, robust and autonomous characterization of the Rubidium Fountains and Hydrogen Masers in the timing ensemble at United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Rb fountain clocks deliver the precise time and time interval required to support GPS III requirements and national assets.\n\nThe vast majority of USNO's OPN funding, across all Cost Elements, is used for the life-cycle replacement of aging equipment.  Therefore, USNO does not  typically buy\/replace the same equipment each year.   While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's. \n\nFY16 - USNO enacted 2 contract options, $617K each.  The contract options procured 4 Steerable atomic clocks,  replacing old clocks towards the end of their usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $308K using 2 existing contracts actions, 4 Steerable clocks ($308K each) - $1.234M.  . \n \nFY17 - USNO will be replacing\/upgrading the HVAC unit in the building containing the primary Master Clock System (estimated $1.5M).  This would be the major source of growth for this cost element (CE) because the HVAC does not require frequent replacement. Replace 3 Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators ($308K each) - $924K thus replacing old technology towards the end of its usable lifecycle under 1 contract.   \n\nFY18 Replace Environmental Chambers - $775K.  The Master Clock building contains individual chambers that precisely control temperature and humidity where the atomic clocks are used operationally. Each chamber contains rubidium atoms that are laser-cooled to about the coldest temperature anything can be. The result is continued accuracy for operational needs and continuously running timepiece.\n\nIn each year, USNO is procuring different elements of the master clock system and the cost associated with these elements is different. \n\n1.10 OIS Architecture: Primary Oceanographic Prediction System\n\nThe Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.\n\n(POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global METOC support of the fleet. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support.\n\nIncrease is due to cyber security requirements mandated by the Navy, including the implementation of new shipboard missions systems that increases the requirement for computing and storage resources, new technologies that make existing equipment obsolete.  The sonar systems aboard TAG-S survey vessels have to be replaced due to equipment age such that the vendor no longer supports the equipment. The new sonar systems have greater resolution than the old systems and there are no new sonar systems available that have the resolution of the legacy equipment and software. This lifecycle replacement of the sonar systems results in increased data volume and the need for increased computational power to process and store the data.\n\n1.12 - The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) \n\nThe Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.\n\nIt was established circa 1996 as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IA Acquisition Program in order to provide scientific computing capability for oceanography and meteorology.  The POPS-Met Deputy Program Manager (DPM) is responsible for that portion of the POPS fielded at the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN).  In accordance with the POPS-Met System Integration Master Plan (SIMP), the storage, networking, and compute nodes\/memory are replaced on a four year cycle. High Performance Computing (HPC) nodes with on-board memory are more expensive and have a higher associated cost in years two and three; network components and storage are replaced in year one and four at a lower overall cost. \n\nUnit price varies year to year because in order to sustain the state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) environment and support the increasing capabilities of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model.  The below illustrates the need for processors, memory, storage, and networks:\n\n- Replacing End of Life (EoL) HPC servers containing 12 CPUs\/32GB RAM with next-generation HPC servers containing 32 CPUs\/128GB RAM is more expensive, and it fits in the same rack space.  This does not increase server count, but increases system capability to meet NWP operational demands.\n\n- Replacing EoL 120TB or online storage with 600TB of online storage (to account for the improved NWP models being support) is more expensive, and fits in the same rack space.\n\n- Replacing EoL 1Gb network components with next-generation 10Gb network components (to move all that addition NWP data around the system) is more expensive and fits in the same rack space.\n\n- Replacing EoL, and adding additional, system security management components with next-generation, and highly secure, system management components, is required to meet new Cyber Security requirements.\n\n1.15 - Time Distribution System\n\nThe vast majority of USNO's OPN funding, across all Cost Elements, is used for the life-cycle replacement of aging equipment.  Therefore, USNO does not  typically buy\/replace the same equipment each year.   While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's. \n\nFY16 - USNO invested in new GPSIII technology that could improve the distribution of GPS data.  \n\nFY17 - USNO will be installing and testing the new technology to understand the benefits\/shortfalls of the new technology, but will make no new procurements.\n\nFY18 - Based on findings funded with FY17 RDT&E, USNO will commit to the new modem technology or be forced to replace aging modems currently being used.\n\nIncrease between FY17 and FY18 is due to USNO implementing new technology to understand the benefits and shortfalls of the newly procured technology from FY16. There is no procurement scheduled for the time distribution system in FY17. In FY18, USNO is procuring a new modem technology to distribute the GPS III signal to keep up with military requirements. The unit price is different because USNO is not procuring any requirements relating to time distribution system in FY17. \n\n1.17 Laser Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR): \n\nThe Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR replaces the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total\nSurvey (CHARTS) system. CZMIL is an aircraft mounted LIDAR system used to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Routine life cycle\nreplacement maintains technology refresh, precludes obsolescence of equipment and repair parts\/maintenance, and maintains survey reliability.  \n\nThe Airborne Coastal System (ACS) meets COCOM High Priority Safety of Navigation hydrographic requirements.  These requirements are validated, vetted and prioritized by COCOMs through the Oceanographic, Hydrographic, Bathymetric survey requirements program (OPNAVINST 3140.55B).  LIDAR system is needed to continue the Navy's effort to rapidly and simultaneously collecting hydrographic and topographic data through state-of-the-art sensors installed in a modified DC-3 aircraft (contract aircraft) via ACS.  ACS survey capability is well suited for very shallow operational requirements compared to T-AGS survey ships.  The ACS supports COCOM and other Naval Component requirements for highly efficient collection capability and Theatre Security Cooperation tool.  Funding supports procurement of a Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR (CZMIL) aircraft mounted LIDAR system necessary to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Due to the singular nature of the Airborne LIDAR platform, the lifecycle replacement (LCR) plan only occurs every several years, thus requiring a replacement system in FY18.  The last system was procured in FY10.  \n\n2.1 (formerly 1.23) Precision Time and Astrometry Network (United States Naval Observatory)\n\nFY18 funds (FY17 funds are under TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO) are for PTA Network modifications which are necessary to enhance and maintain the required security of the network. The increase in funds from FY17 to FY18 are due to the higher unit cost of the required hardware and software modifications planned in FY18.  The PTA Network modernization was initially funded in FY16 with funds from TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING due to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) determination that the USNO scientific IT network showed technical obsolescence as well as critical cyber and physical vulnerabilities.\n\nIn FY 2017, a decrease in Environmental Support Equipment OPN by $0.891M was required for us to to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.\n\nOCO: \n$1M OCO request associated with the European Reassurance Initiative and will support an X-band \"hop station\" on the east coast of CONUS to relay Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services from the Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB to the EUCOM AOR. This is for Cape Canaveral, where USNO already has TWSTT operations in support of local missions. This will increase the robustness of the highest level timing support into EUCOM by allowing failover to the alternate authoritative timing source for the DOD.\n\nThe U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) provides the common time reference for all of the DOD per CJCSI 6130.01E.  USNO's primary site in Washington, DC can provide Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services to the EUCOM AOR over both Ka- and X-band satellites.  USNO's Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB, CO cannot reach the EUCOM AOR with TWSTT services. The Navy, through USNO can improve the robustness of EUCOM timing support over SATCOM channels with this one-time upgrade of satellite based timing distribution on the east coast of CONUS."

Therefore, USNO does not typically buy\/replace the same equipment each year.  While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's.   FY16 - USNO enacted 2 contract options, $618K each.  The contract options procured 4 Steerable  atomic clocks, replacing old clocks towards the end of their usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $309K using 2 existing contracts actions.    FY17 - USNO will be replacing\/upgrading the HVAC unit in the building containing the primary Master Clock System (estimated $1.5M) and purchase 3 Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators, replacing old technology towards the end of its usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $308K using 1 contract.  FY18 Replace Environmental Chambers - $775K.  The Master Clock building contains individual chambers that precisely control temperature and humidity where the atomic clocks are used operationally. Each chamber contains rubidium atoms that are laser-cooled to about the coldest temperature anything can be. The result is continued accuracy for operational needs and continuously running timepiece.  In each year, USNO is procuring different elements of the master clock system and the cost associated with these elements is different.",

While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's.   FY16 - USNO invested in new GPSIII technology that could improve the distribution of GPS data.   FY17 - USNO will be installing and testing the new technology to understand the benefits\/shortfalls of the new technology, but will make no new procurements. FY18 - In FY18, USNO is procuring a new modem technology to distribute the GPS III signal. Additionally, increase of $1M OCO is associated with the European Reassurance Initiative and will support an X-band \"hop station\" on the east coast of CONUS to relay Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services from the Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB to the EUCOM AOR. This is for Cape Canaveral, where USNO already has TWSTT operations in support of local missions. This will increase the robustness of the highest level timing support into EUCOM by allowing failover to the alternate authoritative timing source for the DOD.",

This is a complicated, unique, one-of-a-kind HPC computing infrastructure, owned and operated by the Department of the Navy.  In keeping with DoD and POPS guidelines, the OPN budget for lifecycle replacement due to equipment obsolescence, End-of-Life\/End-of-Support (EoL\/EoS) issues, and new technology insertion, was planned assuming a 3-4 year replacement cycle, with 25-30% of the system components replaced each year without increasing the server footprint.  Replacing the E! oL\/EoS POPS-Met system components with state-of-the-art HPC computing technology, low-latency data storage required to meet NWP processing needs, and the high-speed (40Gbs expanding to 100Gbs) network connections between the computing and storage components is both complicated and expensive; new generations of HPC equipment and infrastructure components are required to meet the expanding FLENUMMETOCCEN mission while addressing ever more stringent cyber security requirements.  In accordance with the POPS-Met System Integration Master Plan (SIMP), the storage, networking, and compute nodes\/memory are replaced on a four year cycle. High Performance Computing (HPC) nodes with on-board memory are more expensive and have a higher associated cost in years two and three; network components and storage are replaced in year one and four at a lower overall cost.   In order to sustain the state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) environment and support the increasing capabilities of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, the below illustrates the need for processors, memory, storage, and networks: -- Replacing End of Life (EoL) HPC servers containing 12 CPUs\/32GB RAM with next-generation HPC servers containing 32 CPUs\/128GB RAM is more expensive, and it fits in the same rack space.  This does not increase server count, but increases system capability to meet NWP operational demands. -- Replacing EoL 120TB or online storage with 600TB of online storage (to account for the improved NWP models being support) is more expensive, and fits in the same rack space. -- Replacing EoL 1Gb network components with next-generation 10Gb network components (to move all that addition NWP data around the system) is more expensive and fits in the same rack space. -- Replacing EoL, and adding additional, system security management components with next-generation, and highly secure, system management components, is required to meet new Cyber Security requirements.",

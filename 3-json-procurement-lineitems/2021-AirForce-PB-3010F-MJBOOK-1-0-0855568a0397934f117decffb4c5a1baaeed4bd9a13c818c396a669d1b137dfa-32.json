Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states,\" The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U)\" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.\n\nThis camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.\n\nOC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft has been modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0305145F"

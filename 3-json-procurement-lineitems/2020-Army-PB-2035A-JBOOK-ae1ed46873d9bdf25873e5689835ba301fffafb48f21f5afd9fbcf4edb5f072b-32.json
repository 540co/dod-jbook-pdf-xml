BEC Increment 0 is a Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository (DoD ABIS), providing 24\/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected terrorist across full range of military operations and preventing terrorist operations. DoD ABIS enables DOD, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions. DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation and improve business practices."

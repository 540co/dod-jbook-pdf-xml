            "val": "The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army ERP systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). The system will meet the full scope of Army Contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. \n\nThis is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology re-designated the ACWS as an ACAT IAM (MAIS) program and authorized the release of the RFP to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system. ACWS just completed an aggressive Source Selection and conducted an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) meeting with the Army Acquisition Executive in March 2017, and received approval from the Defense Acquisition Executive to proceed to contract award in April 2017.  Contract Award is anticipated in May 2017."

            "val": "FY2018 procurement funding supports ACWS software licenses and system fielding activities (Organization Change Management) for Build 1 (TO 002) in the Development and Deployment phase. The licenses procurement is aligned to our deployment schedule, and if not funded ACWS will be unable to fully deploy the system to all end users and retire Legacy systems. This will result in extending the program schedule and increasing total program costs (overhead)."

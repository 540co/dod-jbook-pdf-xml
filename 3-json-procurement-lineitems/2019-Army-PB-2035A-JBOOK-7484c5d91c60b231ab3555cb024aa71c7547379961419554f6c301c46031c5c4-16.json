This program procures vehicles for Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) activities, such as Japan, Korea, Kwajalein and Honduras, where General Services Administration (GSA) fleet leased vehicles are not available.   Passenger Carrying Vehicles are procurable from commercial vendors, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and after-market sources.  This is a vehicle replacement program that does not have a set Army Acquisition Objective (AAO). Procurements are made to replace Passenger Carrying Vehicles when they reach an over-aged or unserviceable condition.\n\nSedans are of commercial design and procurable from commercial vendors, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and after-market sources. Sedans are used for basic transportation for Army personnel and family members but are also used for investigation, field intelligence, and security missions. Ambulances provide emergency response capability and allow life-saving support for patients during transport to hospitals. Ambulances are procurable from commercial vendors and after-market sources.  Buses are of commercial design and provide short haul and intermediate transportation for Army personnel and family members, including both adult and school-age passengers."

The General Services Administration (GSA) does not lease vehicles to many OCONUS locations.  The 25 vehicles include 19 sedans, 2 ambulances, and 4 buses.  Sedans are utilized by both installations and covert activities that are OCONUS.

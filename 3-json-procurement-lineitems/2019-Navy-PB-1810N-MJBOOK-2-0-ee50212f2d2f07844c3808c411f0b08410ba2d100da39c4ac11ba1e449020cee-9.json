The MD-5 control station is comprised of multiple hardware elements:  the Common Display System (CDS), the Common Processing System (CPS), the Network Processing Group (NPG), and the Integrated Communications System (ICS).  Each MD-5 control station consists of six CDS, two CPS, one NPG, and one ICS.  The CDS is the interface between the Air Vehicle Operator (AVO) and the MD-5 control station software used to control the MQ-25 air vehicle and its associated mission systems.\n\nIncluded in the UMCS program, is integration with existing C4I systems required for MD-5 control station and MQ-25 operations.  C4I systems to be integrated with the MQ-25 program include the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), the Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL), and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).\n\nFY19 includes funding to support the standup of MD-5 control station production.  This effort includes production planning (methodology), non-recurring engineering (NRE) for one MD-5 control station, quality plan and procedures, and the movement of the production line into a dedicated, government owned facility for systems storage, integration and checkout in order to provide sufficient capacity for future production demands.\n\nHardware and software modifications to the CVN are required for the MQ-25 weapons system and are included in the UMCS program.  The hardware modifications include configuration of Unmanned Aviation Warfare Center (UAWC) which houses the MD-5 control station components, a Video Management System (VMS), an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Mission Commander (UMC) station and procurement and installation of ARC-210 radio systems required for MQ-25 command and control.  Software modifications required for MQ-25 include changes to the Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS) and the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) systems."

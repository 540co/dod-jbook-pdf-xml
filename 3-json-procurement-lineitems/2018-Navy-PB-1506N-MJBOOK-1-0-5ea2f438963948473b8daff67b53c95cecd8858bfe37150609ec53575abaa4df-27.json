            "val": "This line item funds modification efforts for the System of Systems (SOS) and Family of Systems (FOS) that support the Marine Air Ground Task Force Electronic Warfare (MAGTF EW) mission.  These SOS and FOS are designed to support improved capabilities to address existing and emerging threats and close gaps in MAGTF EW sufficiency and integration in the EW arena.  These capabilities are designed for carriage on an expansive variety of organic air and ground MAGTF assets and include: Software Reprogrammable Payload (SRP), Collaborative Electronic Attack (EA)\/EW Battle Management, EW Services Architecture (formerly Collaborative On-Line Reconnaissance Provider of Operational Responsive Attack Link (CORPORAL)), and Intrepid Tiger series.\n\nMAGTF EW will support procurement of new technologies and equipment as needed to combat emerging EW technologies and systems."

            "val": "The term Electronic Warfare (EW) refers to the use of electomagnetic (EM) energy and Directed Energy (DE) to control the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) or to attack the enemy.  EW consists of three divisions: Electronic Attack (EA), electronic protect (EP), and Electronic Warfare Support (EWS).  Further, some cyber-operations can be enabled by EW operations.  Accordingly, the Marine Corps considers the EMS as a war fighting environment that must be fully integrated into the MAGTF Commanders' scheme-of-maneuver and concept-of-fires.  The concept of operations for MAGTF EW takes advantage of advancements in technology that facilitate integration of airborne and ground-based EW assets to collaboratively interact, providing the MAGTF Commander with the capabilities to control the EMS at the time and place of his choosing.\n\nFY2017 REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS (RAA) JUSTIFICATION: $16.300 Million additional funds to support the following:\n$5.390 Million for five (5) AN\/ALQ-231(V)3 (Rotary Wing) pods\n$4.610 Million for support equipment\n$6.300 Million for non-recurring engineering for the integration of the AN\/ALQ-231(V)1 on the KC-130 platform which supports an urgent fleet requirement put forth in a validated Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS) MROC\nDM 21-2016."

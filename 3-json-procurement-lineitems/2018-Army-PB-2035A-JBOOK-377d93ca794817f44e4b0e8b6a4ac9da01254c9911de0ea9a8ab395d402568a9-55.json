Universal Test Set (UTS) is designed to test CREW systems before conduct of operations.\n\nDismounted CREW capabilities (THOR III\/BALDR) and Universal Test Set (UTS) Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) will formally transition to a program of record (POR) in FY2016.  Funding in FY2016 supports the activities required to obtain full material release (FMR) and formally transition to a program of record (POR).\n\nThis program is a new start in FY2016 for Dismounted CREW\/Universal Test Set (UTS).  FY2013 and prior funding supported the procurement of CREW-2 Duke systems."

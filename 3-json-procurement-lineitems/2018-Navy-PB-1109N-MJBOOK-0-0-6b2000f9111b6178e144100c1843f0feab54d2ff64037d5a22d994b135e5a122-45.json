The LWPS is a small, modular, self-contained system that uses filtration and reverse osmosis technology to produce 75 to 125 gallons per hour (GPH) of potable water from fresh, brackish, salt, and nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) contaminated water. This capability is necessary to provide safe and potable water to battalion sized or smaller units in an expeditionary environment or in extended company operations."

            "val": "The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system. CHARCS provides automation support for information collection, reporting, investigations, source & interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps. CHARCS reports digital data such as maps, overlays, images, video, biometrics, scanned documents and audio files. These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products. Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems. The first is the AN\/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT), which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents. The second is the AN\/PYQ-3 CI\/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS), which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members) and Operational Management Team (OMT) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers, scanners, and cameras to assist the collection mission. CHATS is also used by the Operational Management Team (OMT) that normally directs 3-5 collection and reporting teams. Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK).\n\nThe C-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI\/HUMINT collection missions. C-PSK capabilities are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and include video and camera equipment, global positioning system (GPS), and voice recording device. Phasing in of the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD) to displace the C-PSK will begin in FY 2018 and complete in FY 2019. The EUD is a COTS Mobile Handheld device, managed by PEO Soldier, which provides all of the operational capacity of the C-PSK in one hardware device. The MS-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI\/HUMINT collection missions. MS-PSK capabilities are COTS technologies and include night vision photography & video, captured materiel tracking, digital media forensics software, and Document Exploitation (DOCEX) software."

            "val": "This program supports the Army Modernization priorities (Build a More Lethal Force) through enhancement of Joint Lethality in contested environments by minimizing and eliminating erosion of close combat capability relative to peer competitors in complex terrain as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (NDS).The M240 series machine guns are available in different configurations for various applications.  The M240B Machine Gun is a ground version of the original M240 Machine Gun, 7.62MM Medium Machine Gun class weapon, designed as a coaxial\/pintle-mounted weapon for tanks and light armored vehicles.  The M240B also includes: a flash suppressor, front sight, carrying handle, buttstock, pistol grip, bipod, heat shield and rear sight assembly.  The M240B Machine Gun may also be tripod-mounted and used in conjunction with a traversing and elevating mechanism and mount pintle.  The M240H is a variant of this same family of Machine Guns and is employed as the self defensive armament subsystem for the UH-60 BLACK HAWK and CH-47 Chinook Helicopters.  The M240H uses the same receiver and barrel as the M240B but has a spade grip trigger assembly.  It also has a unique mounting interface and pintle to properly interface with the helicopter platform.  The lighter M240L replaces the M240B in Special Forces\/Rangers, Light Infantry and Airborne units.  The M240L significantly reduces the weight of the current M240B, by approximately 6 pounds, while maintaining the same level of reliability.  The weight reduction is accomplished through the use of lightweight materials and innovative manufacturing techniques."

The RQ-7B Shadow UAS provides dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition, Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment and Force Protection to the Marine Air-Ground Task Force.  The RQ-7B Shadow UAS provides the Marine Expeditionary Force with critical battlefield intelligence and targeting information in the rapid cycle time required for success at the tactical level.\n\nThe RQ-7B Shadow UAS consists of four air vehicles each configured with an Electro-Optical\/Infra-Red sensor payload, launcher, ground control stations, attrition engine, support equipment, and Government furnished equipment, which includes power generation communications equipment, automated recovery equipment, remote video terminals, vehicle mounted shelters, and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles with trailer(s).  Each system is equipped with one maintenance section multifunctional vehicle and is supported by a mobile maintenance facility.  \n\nThe RQ-7B Shadow UAS modifications are procured through the Army on the Army's Shadow Tactical UAS contracts and are identical to the Army's system. Every effort is made to ensure that the  Marine Corps RQ-7B Shadow UAS configuration matches the Army's such that combat units maintain maximum interoperability, maintainability, and combat effectiveness."

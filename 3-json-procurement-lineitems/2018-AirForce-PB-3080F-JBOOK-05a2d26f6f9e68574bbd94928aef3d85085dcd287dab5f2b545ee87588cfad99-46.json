Combat video documentation is used for operational reporting and analysis, situational awareness, battle damage assessment, intelligence and operational analysis, casualty identification, and the historical record. In addition, video and multimedia based products are developed for warfighter operations, readiness training, medical videography, public and internal information, testing and evaluation, and corporate communications. Commanders recognize that imagery quickly conveys very accurate and unbiased information, and are requiring greater amounts of video imagery to help meet the challenges of a very active warfighting force. The Air Force is meeting this challenge by dedicating funding to procure and sustain this important capability by replacing older video studio systems with newer and more capable equipment and systems for both Air Force video production and combat\/contingency documentation teams. Imagery acquisition systems are centrally managed to establish and maintain standardization of systems, as well as to ensure full interoperability with all other electronic image acquisition, transmission system formats, and presentation systems used in the Air Force."

These policy documents exist to ensure DoD and AF compliance with public laws: 36 CFR 1237\/1220 and Title 44 Chapters 3301\/3101. These funds are used for audio\/visual equipment funding at the only three AF active duty COMCAM squadrons, which provide lobal\/deployable rapid response during wartime operations, worldwide crises, contingencies, joint exercises, and humanitarian operations. Additionally, these funds procure audio\/visual equipment supporting AF-wide(garrison and deployed) needs for photo, graphics and video products that aid public diplomacy, internal\/external communication, information operations, operational\/planning efforts, and effective\/efficient training."

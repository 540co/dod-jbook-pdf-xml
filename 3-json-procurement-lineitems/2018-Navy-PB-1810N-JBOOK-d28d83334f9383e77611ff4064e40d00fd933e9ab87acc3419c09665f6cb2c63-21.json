            "val": "FY2018 increase due to FY2017 funding being rephased for prior years under execution. FY2017 funds provide the bare minimum for sustainment of existing fleet capabilities. FY2018 funding is required to complete initial outfitting of Transfer Under Pressure (TUP) spares and planned upgrades to Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS).  \n\nThe Submarine Escape and Rescue Program, formerly Deep Submergence Systems Program (DSSP), is responsible for the procurement, life cycle support, and improvement and modernization of assigned platforms and programs.  The Submarine Escape and Rescue Program provides for the procurement of equipment to support the establishment and maintenance of fleet capability for a number of programs which perform submarine search and rescue, inspection, and object location and retrieval from the ocean environment.  Submarine Escape and Rescue procurements replace obsolete, non-supportable equipment and subsystems through phased improvement and modernization projects.  These projects may include special ship alterations, field change kits, and design corrections.\n\nSOURCES:  The sources for these acquisitions are limited.  There are few private companies actively engaged in deep ocean engineering and even fewer with the specialized experience, knowledge, and facilities to meet the exacting requirement of the Submarine Escape and Rescue Program.  Accordingly, sole source contracts are sometimes required; however, where possible, contracting via open competition is utilized.\n\nREFERENCES:\nAcquisition Plans 584-87 Revision 7 approved August 2000.  Acquisition plan for Submarine Escape and Rescue is reviewed twice annually by the Submarine Escape and Rescue Review Group (SERRG).\n\n[P40A \/ HJ030 - RESCUE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: INTERVENTION SYSTEMS (ATMOSPHERIC DIVING SYSTEM (ADS)\/ROV\/ SRDRS\/SUBMARINE RESCUE CHAMBER (SRC) Intervention assets (ADS\/ROV) are required to support the SRDRS and SRC world-wide rescue capability mission.  Intervention assets are used to clear disabled submarines seating surfaces, attach the SRC downhaul cable, attach salvage fittings, deliver emergency life support stores, and assess disabled submarines.  The ADS is a modified COTS one-man, one atmosphere diving system.  An initiative is in process to transition from the ADS manned system to an unmanned ROV to reduce operational risk; full transition is pending availability of funding for second ROV.  SRC provides shallow water rescue capability.  SRDRS is the deep water rescue vehicle and will be delivered in increments.  The Submarine Rescue System-Rescue Capable System (SRS-RCS) completed OPEVAL in FY08 and is currently the deep water rescue ready vehicle for the U.S. Navy.  The final component of SRDRS is TUP or Submarine Rescue System-Submarine Decompression System (SRS-SDS).  Full Operational Capability (FOC) has been delayed due to efforts associated with Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM) restoration to service; Initial Operating Capability (IOC) planned for March 2018.\nSURVIVABILITY This equipment will provide a more efficient CO2 removal capability giving the fleet an increase in survival time from 3 days to 7 days for a disabled submarine and adds state of the art atmospheric monitoring equipment aboard each submarine."

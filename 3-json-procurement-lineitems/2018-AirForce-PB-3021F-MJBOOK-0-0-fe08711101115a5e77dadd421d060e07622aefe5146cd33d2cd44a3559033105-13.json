        "Description": {
            "val": "The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable\/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the atmosphere of the earth or in near space. The USNDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 21 Jan 2004, documents the requirements for space-based NUDET detection. Space-based NUDET detection is also mandated by Public Law 110-181, dated 28 Jan 2008, which directs the Secretary of Defense to maintain the capability for space-based nuclear detection at or above 2008 capability levels. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.\n\nThe USNDS 6 program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the US Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA\/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the procurement of the USNDS 6 ground segment (described below).\n\nDoD funds its contribution to the NDS program in PE 1203913F with RDT&E, SPAF, and O&M dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS III Space Segment PE 1203265F for GPS III SVs. NDS payload integration onto Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites is funded by NNSA\/NA-22.\n\nUSNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit platforms (classified GEO hosts).  Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS.  Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP) and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)) and the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable\/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded.  The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. \n\nThe ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolutionary acquisition approach.\n\nThe upgrade to the GNT is the survivable\/endurable Universal Ground Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) Terminal (UGNT) which is funded with AF RDT&E in this PE.  The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable and endurable USNDS communications via Milstar\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits.  The GNT supports Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) and Nuclear Force Management (NFM) missions.  The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable\/Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW\/AA and NFM.  The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the MGS mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT.  The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities that meet survivable\/endurable ITW\/AA requirements directed by the President, SECDEF, Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations. Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 1203913F, NUDET Detection System (SPACE)."

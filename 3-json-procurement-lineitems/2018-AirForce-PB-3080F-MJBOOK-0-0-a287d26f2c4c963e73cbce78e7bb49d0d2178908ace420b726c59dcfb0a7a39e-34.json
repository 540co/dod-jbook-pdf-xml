            "val": "To enhance transparency, in FY 2015 DEAMS Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding was transferred from Weapon System Code (WSC) 834430, Global Combat Support System - Air Force Family of Systems (GCSS-AF FOS) to WSC 834470 DEAMS.  Prior to FY 2015, DEAMS OPAF funding was shown in WSC 834430, GCSS-AF FOS.\n\nDefense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 is planned as:\nRelease 1 - Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)\nRelease 2 - AMC with TWCF, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome\nRelease 3 - Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)\nRelease 4 - Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan\nRelease 5 - U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio\nRelease 6 - Air Force Material Command (AFMC) (Test Bases)\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 is transitioning to the Operation and Support (O&S) phase post Milestone C to support deployed locations.\n\nDEAMS reported MAIS Critical Change in the 31 May 2016 Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES). The program did not meet the original estimate schedule threshold for the Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in August 2015. DEAMS Inc 1 capability will continue to be deployed in FY2016 - FY2020 as approved by the Milestone Decision Authority.\n\nThe schedule includes an Oracle R12 upgrade transition to a new production environment and reporting, DCAS, Direct Disbursements, and Audit functionality.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 funding through FY 2020 is to support the listed deployments. DEAMS Inc 2 will require licenses to support acquisition requirements for AFSPACE and AFMC starting in FY 2022.\n\nProcurement funding for DEAMS is in PE 0901538F, Financial Information Management Systems Development (FMISD)."

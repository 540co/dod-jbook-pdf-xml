They can be employed from an enclosure or the open battle field as assault weapons against bunkers, field fortifications, structures and other hard-point positions. Each shoulder fired rocket family has a training launcher and sub-caliber practice rocket that fully simulates firing.  This includes items such as:\n\nThe Tactical Rocket, 66mm High Explosive anti-armor (HEAA) weapon is a lightweight, single shot, disposable weapon optimized to defeat light armored vehicles and other hard targets at close combat ranges.\n\nThe Tactical Rocket, 83mm High Explosive (HE) Shoulder Mounted Assault Weapon (SMAW) Rocket is designed especially for use against main battle tanks and other armored vehicles. The rocket is unguided, dual mode, high explosive rocket contained in a disposable one-shot rocket container.\n\nThe Rocket, 83mm Common Practice (CP) Shoulder Mounted Assault Weapon (SMAW). The CP round is an unguided shoulder fired practice rocket designed to simulate firing a live rocket at hardened targets."

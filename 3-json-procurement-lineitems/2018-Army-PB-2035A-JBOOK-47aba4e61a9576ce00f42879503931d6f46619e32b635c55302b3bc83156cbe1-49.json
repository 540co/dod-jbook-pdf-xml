            "val": "The Family of Forklifts supports various combat, combat support, and combat service support units in the loading and unloading of palletized supplies.  Currently, the forklift family consists of the 5K Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF) and the All-Terrain Lifter, Army System (ATLAS).\n\nThe 5K Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF) is used to load and unload palletized supplies including ammunition from International Standard Organization (ISO) containers and tactical vehicles.  The 5K LCRTF will move supplies across the beach and rough terrain to transfer loads from aircraft landing zones and tactical vehicles.  The 5K LCRTF mission profile is 20 hours of operations in all types of environmental conditions.  The 5K LCRTF will be employed by cargo battalions, artillery units, transportation support battalions, combat service support units and various aviation units.  It will be routinely in forward deployed areas with operating forces in support of combat operations other than war.  The 5K LCRTF system is a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations (i.e. Disaster Relief).  It can be transported by C-130 aircraft and external sling load via CH47D helicopter.  The 5K LCRT Forklift Army Acquisition Objective (AAO): 2,776 Systems.  The minimum sustainment rate is 15 systems.\n\nThe All-Terrain Lifter, Army System (ATLAS) is a family of, C-130 airplane, transportable 10,000 Pound (LB) capacity variable reach rough terrain forklifts. The ATLAS primary missions include handling all classes of supply, stuffing and un-stuffing standard Army pallets in 20 foot International Standard Organization (ISO) containers, handling break-bulk cargo and loads weighing up to 10,000 LBS on Air Force 463L pallets.  It is a key component to the Army's Container Oriented Distribution System which is essential to the deployment of an Expeditionary Army and sustainment of a deployed force.  The ATLAS forklift mobility capabilities support all the Army's Brigade Combat Teams and units from seven branches (Transportation, Quartermaster, Ordnance, Missile & Munitions, Engineer, Aviation and Medical).  Crew survivability is being addressed in accordance with the Army's Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS).  The ATLAS is a military unique vehicle.  It operates in all terrains, has cross country mobility and road speed of 23 Miles per Hour (MPH).  Commercial forklifts cannot meet the military requirements nor the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) identified in the ATLAS requirements document.  The ATLAS is capable of performing all mission requirements and meets EPA Tier III emissions requirements, with increased reliability and survivability.  The ATLAS system is a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations (i.e. Disaster Relief).  The ATLAS Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is: 4,645.  The Army has procured 4,399 Systems."

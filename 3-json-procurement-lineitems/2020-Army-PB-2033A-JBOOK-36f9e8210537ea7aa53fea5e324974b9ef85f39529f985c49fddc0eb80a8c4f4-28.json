            "val": "The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, is a Joint Service program between the US Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY2014 and will continue through FY2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance. It replaces all howitzers in all USMC missions and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 40km with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 pounds over the M198 system. Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32-percent more terrain worldwide and is 70-percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer. The howitzer will be going through obsolescent replacement of electronic components in its digital fire control system, since it has been in the field for more than ten years.\n\nThis budget line item provides funding for various modification and sustainment efforts such as Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) component refresh, integration of upgraded components, and interoperability issues including M-Code satellite signal in support of the M777A2 program."

            "val": "FY 2020 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.367 million continues to support retrofits of previously contracted Engineering Change Proposals for items such as the Improved Power Conditioning Control Module (I-PCCM), Hydraulic Power Assist Kit (HyPAK), Mission Computer (MSC-R), Chief of Section Display (CSD-R), and Chrome Cannon Tubes that are required to replace unsupportable and obsolete legacy components.  The Digital Fire Control System software will also be upgraded as part of these retrofits. The upgraded software requires additional operator training as it reflects significant changes to operator tactics and procedures.  Chrome Cannon Tubes increase safety, accuracy, and longevity of the howitzer by eliminating propellant residue inside the cannon tubes. Propellant residue causes spiral wear which reduces the muzzle velocity of the howitzer and causes fuze malfunctions of projectiles. Reduced muzzle velocity leads to projectiles impacting short of their intended targets.  \n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

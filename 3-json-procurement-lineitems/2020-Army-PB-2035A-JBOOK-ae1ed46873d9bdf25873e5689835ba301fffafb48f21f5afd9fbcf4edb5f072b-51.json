            "val": "The Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS) develops, fields, and sustains a basic automated foreign speech and text translation capability for Army tactical systems to augment and compliment limited human linguistic resources. These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held\/wearable portable device, a laptop\/mobile device, and in a networked\/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English from a prioritized list of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (e.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS is interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) and Nett Warrior, and will be interoperable with a future version of the CI\/HUMINT Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS)."

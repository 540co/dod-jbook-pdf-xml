            "val": "PE 1203173F R&D Space and Missile Operations\nThe Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB (KAFB), NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in support of prototype, experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) and Mobile Range (MRF) at KAFB and at Schriever AFB (SAFB), CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates, and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions and transitions designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs. In addition RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as Air Force Space systems transition to an Enterprise-based ground C2. Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nPE 1203174F Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development\nLocated at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program supports the AFSPC Space Analysis Center Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system. AVAC is a stand-alone system that provides a crosscutting capability to conduct, support, and report analysis on a myriad of tools, data, models and simulations. This system allows leadership to make decisions based on quantifiable operational impacts output from AVAC based on various vignettes and studies applied to space and cyber assets. Funding buys system-specific hardware, software, routers, licenses, etc., to maintain the efficiency and compatibility with all current models.\n\nDISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Distributed Communications Architecture.  This system provides a network-based communications capability enabling dispersed space personnel to participate in space exercises and wargames and to assist in development, testing, and validation of SIIRTD innovation projects supporting the Combat Air Forces.  It can also support limited command and control capabilities for space operations.\n\nSPACE ANALYSIS CENTER:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Air Force Space Command Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system.  The system provides classified modeling and simulation tools for the AFSPC Space Analysis Center to conduct operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Related modeling and simulation tool development is funded in RDT&E, AF, PE 1203174F, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture. Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nFY 2019 -$1.000M reduction due to insufficient justification; FY 2020 -$0.229M to reduce Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Virtual Analysis Cap.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "PE 1203173F RDSMO\nFY 2020 funds will be used to recapitalize RDSMO common user equipment, communication systems, fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems and hardware and software to support the transition and implementation of EGS baseline requirements into the RSC and SAFB C2 environments. This recapitalization will support the Long Duration Propulsive Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) (LDPE)-1 mission, the AFSPC-12 mission, the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) mission, the Tetra (1-3) and LDPE-2-3 follow-on prototyping missions.  The MMSOC C2 baseline will continue to be supported through FY2020 for legacy missions being operated at the RSC and SAFB.  Funding will assist RDSMO to rapidly respond and implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain.  Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, experimentation, prototyping, etc. \n\n\nPE 1203174F SIIRTD\nFY 2020 funding modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities. This effort will incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realized the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities."

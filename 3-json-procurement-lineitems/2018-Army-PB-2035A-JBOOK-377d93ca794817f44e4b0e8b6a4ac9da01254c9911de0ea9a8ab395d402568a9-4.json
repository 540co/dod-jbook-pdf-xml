The JCSE mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM) 0291-14, the Army is mandated to fund 1\/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan."

            "val": "JCSE: FY2018 base funding in the amount of $5.051 million procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance; which includes major upgrades to large and small aperture mobile satellite systems, Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), Airborne\/En-Route, Forced Entry and terrestrial and single-channel equipment. Currently employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment is approaching the end of its life cycle and requires replacement, along with technology refreshment; to meet the modernization program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command and Control communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the ARMY is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Modernization Program is built\/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. Services influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements."

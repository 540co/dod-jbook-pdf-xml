JAGM improves the warfighter's capability in adverse weather, day or night, and in obscured\/countermeasure environments.  The JAGM Increment 1 system will replace aviation-launched, Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missile, and Helicopter Launched Fire-&-Forget (HELLFIRE) Missile System.  JAGM is an Army-led joint program that addresses rotary wing fixed wing and unmanned aerial vehicle requirements.  The Department of Navy threshold platform is the AH-1Z.  The JAGM system includes missile, trainers, container, support equipment and software modifications to the M-299 launcher."

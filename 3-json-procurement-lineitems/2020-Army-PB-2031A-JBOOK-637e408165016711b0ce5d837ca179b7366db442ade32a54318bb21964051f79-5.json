The system consists of the video transmitter and antenna suite which are mounted on the UH-72 Lakota aircraft, the ground-based receiver antenna array, and a ground operator handheld receiver\/display device for dismounted operations.\n\nThe systems allows the platform to transmit streaming video to the operator on the ground that receives, records, displays, and can play back real-time full motion video imagery and moving map metadata. This system is utilized in the support of state and federal law enforcement agencies, emergency first responders, and border patrol and customs agencies and as such, it is vital that this capability remain available to those agencies."

            "val": "The Biometric Automated Toolset System (BATS) can collect and store biometric information, to include fingerprints, iris scans and facial images and is able to \"match\" personnel whose biometrics correspond to a record of stored data. Information from networked BAT-Clients is sent to BAT-Servers. The BAT-Servers update other BAT-Servers and provide information to the biometrics intelligence process for further analysis. Funding supports the hardware reset and technical refresh of the Family of Systems Biometrics equipment. The refresh will address hardware technology obsolescence, along with software updates to meet Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS) compliance. Biometric identification has become a key capability in counter insurgency warfare in support of ongoing contingency operations. Without this critical capability, the Marine Corps loses the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities.\n\nExpeditionary Forensic Exploitation Capability (EFEC) is a portable, expeditionary laboratory capable of conducting Level I and II forensics analysis of captured enemy material, evidence and information. It is comprised of 4 Table of Authorized Material Control Numbers (TAMCN), which include Chemical, Media, and Site Exploitation, and a Laboratory kit."

This system provides the Marine Corps the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities identified in COCOM CONOPS, CONPLANS\/OPLANS, and Theater Campaign Plans in support of the Joint Force requirement."

            "val": "This budget line provides funding for modernization efforts at Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated Army Ammunition Plants (AAPs) and commercial facilities, including replacement of obsolete or worn production equipment, correction of deficiencies and upgrade of infrastructures.  The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.\n\nThis budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.\n\nProcurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $329.356 million will support modernization projects to include replacement of sewer lines at Holston Army Ammunition Plant (AAP), modernization upgrades to the small caliber production lines at Lake City AAP, and upgrades to the industrial sewer lines at Radford AAP.  Funds will support infrastructure upgrades at Holston, Iowa, Lake City, Radford, and Scranton AAP.  Funds will also support modernization projects to expand the production capacity of RDX at Holston AAP.  Efforts include design of new nitration and wash facility, activation of building G-3 for RDX and nitroguanidine (NQ) recrystallization production processes, and modernization efforts to improve ANSOL treatment requirements.  Funds will also support critical work environmental projects, including improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will provide for engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.\n\nFY 2018 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  Funds support the decontamination and demolition of excess production equipment and facilities buildings at Lake city and Radford AAP and the layaway of various load, assemble and pack production lines at Milan AAP.  Funds will also support the disposal of excess equipment at McAlester AAP.  \n\nFY 2018 funding supports the care and maintenance of laid-away equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations."

Bulk storage tanks vary in age and several existing tanks were installed in the 1940s.  Acid bulk storage capacity is required to handle sulfuric acid, oleum, strong nitric acid, weak nitric acid, and processed (pyro) acid.  The safe and reliable storage of acids is critical for nitrocellulose manufacturing operations.  Containment dikes surrounding these bulk storage tanks have deteriorated and repairs are required to contain an acid release in the event of a catastrophic failure."

This includes building and infrastructure sustainment\/ refurbishment.  Effort will also fund preventive, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of production equipment and facilities that would prevent serious injury to personnel or effects to the environment.  Funding is also provided for cyber security requirements, fire and emergency services and to execute an environmental program to ensure compliance with existing Federal, State, and local environmental laws."

The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers"

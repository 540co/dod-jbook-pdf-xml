            "val": "The One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT) systems require an update to an Increment II OSRVT.  The OSRVT Increment II Upgrade Program of Record (POR) began in FY 2012.  The OSRVT Increment II consists of a base system with Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) 6 transceiver, tablet computer, Antennas, Type I encryption, Ku-Directional Antennas (KuDA) with an On-The-Move (OTM) capable variant, and an extended range Mobile Directional Antennas System (MDAS).  Beginning in FY21, the ROVER 6 will be upgraded to a 6S variant to meet new spectrum requirements and the system will also include a Soldier Portable OsrvT (SPOT) for dismounted users consisting of a wearable tablet computer and a Tactical Net ROVER 2 Encrypted (TNR 2E) transceiver.  Software supports decoding Telemetry Data from multiple Manned\/Unmanned Aircraft Systems, provides Electro-Optical (EO)\/Infrared (IR) payload control, and supports off-target calculations.  OSRVT supports current operations as well as FUAS requirements.  The OSRVT MODS APE A000121000, began in FY 2017. Prior to FY2017, OSRVT Procurement funds were provided via the SHADOW MODS APE A00018000."

The ROVER 6S upgrade meets new spectrum requirements in order to maintain interoperability with Small UAS and the SPOT is a wearable variant for dismounted users consisting of a wearable tablet computer and a TNR 2E transceiver.\n\nIn accordance with 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities."

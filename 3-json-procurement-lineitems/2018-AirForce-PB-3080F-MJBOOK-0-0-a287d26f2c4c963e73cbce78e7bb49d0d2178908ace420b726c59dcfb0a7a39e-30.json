            "val": "The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.\n \nGlobal Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. \n \nGlobal ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. \n\nGlobal ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency\/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF\/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment. FY15 was the first year of Increment 1 procurement funding to support pre-production activities. The majority of pre-production support activities will be conducted in FY17 and FY18 in advance of the Milestone C decision in 2QFY19.\n\nGlobal ASNT Inc 2 delivers an Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems. \n\nCommon Very Low Frequency (VLF)\/Low Frequency (LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. CVR Inc 2 will produce a VLF\/LF receiver to integrate into current and future airborne and ground based nodes and to improve system performance and reduce supportability costs through commonality. CVR Inc 2 procurement funding is planned to begin in FY20 and has moved from OPAF (3080) to APAF (3010) funding.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0303131F."

            "val": "The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $6.013 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nDistance Support: The Navy Information Application Product Suite (NIAPS) is comprised of integrated Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software   Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software that provides an application hosting service on afloat Navy networks.  NIAPS provides data compression and replication capability designed to re-host typically shore\/web-based applications afloat to minimize bandwidth and provide maximum capability.  NIAPS is comprised of 14 applications and databases launched from a single Distance Support (DS) Portal on NIAPS server. NIAPS runs applications specifically tailored to individual afloat units for training, career management, maintenance, technical drawings, and logistics produced by various Navy functional organizations. NIAPS gives a ship access to critical applications and data using internal shipboard networks, which is faster and cheaper than using external bandwidth and satellite time.\n\nNAVWAR Shore IW Platform: Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) and PEOC4I Shore & Expeditionary Integration Program Office are recognized as the Navy's Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Information Technology (C4ISR\/IT) integration Subject Matter Expert (SME) delivering Shore Information Warfare (IW) Platform Capabilities. Funding supports the identification and validation of C4ISR\/IT system requirements and provides platform architecture, integration and installation design planning efforts tailored to deliver specific required Capability to Shore IW Platforms. Shore IW Platforms support assured Command and Control, voice, video and data communications, Precise Time and Astrometry, and intelligence support services that are critical to allowing the flow of information from Strategic Commanders to the War Fighters both afloat and ashore. MILCON projects associated with Shore IW Platforms require complex planning based on the required capability, which includes advanced planning, integration and installation of numerous C4ISR\/IT systems across multiple programs of record that support Command Centers, Operations Centers and Master Telecommunication Facilities, CONUS and OCONUS.\n \nTelephony: Tactical Voice and Video Communications and Modernization:\nThe Department of Defense (DoD), Chief Information Officer (CIO) has prioritized the modernization of network infrastructure to be regionally based, centrally managed and cyber secure. This includes migrating existing infrastructure from Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to Internet Protocol (IP) based communications to enable Unified Capabilities (UC). Telephony procures and integrates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software to meet the DoD-CIO TDM to IP mandate for the Navy. Program requirements include: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Voice over Secure Internet Protocol (VoSIP), Video Teleconferencing over Secure Internet Protocol (VTCoSIP), Telephony Unified Messaging System (TUMS), Regional Telephony Management System (RTMS), Navy Video Conferencing System (NVCS), NVCS Coalition (NVCS-C), Internet Protocol (IP) Modernization, Aegis Ashore, and Telephony systems infrastructure (e.g. cable plant). Telephony system installations and\/or upgrades occur at facilities in accordance with requirements as identified by Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA).\n\nMILCON C4I Shore Based Enterprise Network Enhancements (Telephony):\nFunding additionally supports procurement and installation of mission related Telephony equipment at the following shore sites:\n - MILCON P-913: Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Atlantic\n - MILCON P-621: NCTAMS Atlantic Det Rota Spain\n - MILCON P-131: NCTAMS Atlantic Det Souda Bay\n - MILCON P-130: Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Sigonella Italy\n\nNAVIFOR MILCON Project P-013: Navy Information Operations Command, Hawaii (NIOC HI) performs all duties assigned by Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT), Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) \/ Commander Tenth Fleet (COMTENTHFLT), Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), and the Director, National Security Agency. NIOC HI conducts and provides support to information warfare, cyber, signals intelligence, Information Operations (IO) and electronic warfare mission areas in the Pacific Fleet area of responsibility (PAC AOR). At the direction of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), FLTCYBERCOM \/ COMTENTHFLT will be deploying substantial Cyber Mission Forces to Oahu. NCTAMS PAC and NIOC HI require close collaboration and alignment between the elements of the intelligence community under NIOC HI and the network operations under NCTAMS PAC in a controlled environment. MILCON Project P-013 provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams, which currently has inadequate SCIF space.\n\n[P5 \/ MILCON P-013 - Wahiawa  Shorebased Enhancements]: Funding supports the procurement and installation of mission related Command, Control, Communications, Computers and intelligence\/Information Technology (C4I\/IT) equipment to new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMSPAC) Facility."

In FY21, the projects will transition into the installation execution phase as the Program of Record (POR) systems begin integration and installation efforts.  The Shore IW Program will continue to support the installation efforts by overseeing each POR installation and ensuring the integration of the Platform meets Full Operational Capability (FOC) and Full and Final Acceptance (FFA) is achieved.  P913 will reach FOC and FFA in FY23 and P621 will meet FOC and FFA in FY22.  \n\nNaval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) Shore Information Warfare (IW) Platform funds support advanced planning, system of systems architecture, and design and integration planning efforts associated with the following Shore IW Platform MILCON projects that deliver Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Information Technology (C4ISR\/IT) Capability: P621 - Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Atlantic Det Rota (NCTAMS LANT Det Rota); P130 - Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station, Sigonella (NCTS Sigonella); P913 - Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Atlantic, (NCTAMS LANT C4I); P001 - US Naval Observatory; P131 - NCTAMS LANT Det Souda Bay; and P649 - NCTS Guam. Each design is tailored to meet a required capability. The Shore and Expeditionary Program Office provides portfolio management of MILCON Shore IW Platform efforts to manage requirements as they change due to real world events and to ensure required capability is delivered on time and within cost. System integration designs range from integrating 20 to 80+ different systems at each Shore IW Platform. \n\nTelephony: FY21 decrease of $2.657M is the result of completion of non-recurring efforts at two MILCON sites in FY20 (P-913 and P-621). FY21 funds are provided for procurement and installation of Internet Protocol (IP) based equipment in support of DoD's Everything over IP (EoIP) mandate, Telephony requirements specifically unsecure Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and Voice over Secure Internet Protocol (VoSIP) both CONUS and OCONUS.\n\nCollateral Equipment, MILCON Outfitting Project P-013: \nFY21 decrease of $3.500M is due to scheduled completion of phased one and entering second (2nd) phase of MILCON project. Funding supports procurement and installation of mission related command, control, communications, computers and intelligence\/Information Technology (C4I\/IT) equipment to new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMSPAC) Facility in Wahiawa."

        "Description": {
            "val": "This Budget Line Item (BLI) consists of three separate and distinct programs, the N98 sponsored Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) program, the N96 sponsored Sonar Dome Rubber Windows (SDRW) program, and the N2N6 sponsored Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) program.\n\nFY 2019 TO FY 2020 INCREASE\/DECREASE STATEMENT:\n- FY 2019 ($10.134M) to FY 2020 ($8.967M) decrease ($-1.167M) is driven by the lower cost of procuring Cost Code VM601 USW-DSS Tech Refresh systems targeted for shipboard platforms in FY 2020 vs. the higher cost of procuring USW-DSS Tech Refresh systems targeted for shore sites\/tactical trainers in FY 2019.  Shipboard platform systems are roughly half the configuration size of a shore site\/tactical trainer.\n\nAIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC) (Cost Code VM301):\nThe AN\/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) program provides increased situational awareness to the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in support of force protection, primarily in the area of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). Through the integration of off-board sensors and signal, data and display processors, the AN\/SQQ-34 is utilized in detecting, classifying, and localizing threats. An integrated element of the Carrier Combat System, the AN\/SQQ-34 supports the tactical deployment of embarked ASW and Surface Warfare (SUW) assets. The program provides technical refreshes to legacy AN\/SQQ-34 systems on all Carriers and shore sites in support of Fleet introduction and shipboard integration of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter. Upgrades to legacy systems will enable exchange of sensor, tactical and imagery data with the MH-60R initially and eventually with P-8 and Triton Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) aircraft. It completes the Kill Chain by linking sensor platform to sensor controllers and the ASW\/SUW commanders. In order to support multiple MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopters, the Common Data Link (CDL) will also be upgraded. CDL is the Navy Aircraft Carrier ultra wide-band, digital, secure data link, comprised of radio equipment that provides configuration-controlled and standardized wide-band, digital, and secure communication paths between multiple reconnaissance sensors and their users. Initially, a single User Interface Group (UIG) upgrade to CDL will be fielded in concert with CV-TSC\/MH-60R deployments, providing a single MH-60R\/aircraft link.\n\nSONAR DOME RUBBER WINDOWS (SDRW) (Cost Code VM401):\nAN\/SQS-53 Sonar Dome Rubber Windows (SDRW) are installed on CG47 and DDG51 class ships. This program provides emergency replacement, wire-reinforced, pressurized rubber acoustic windows and attachment hardware, which experience failure due to corrosion, fatigue, and impact damage. The SDRW significantly improves the surface ship sonar performance by reducing flow-induced self-noise and by providing increased source level receiving and sensitivity resulting from reduced attenuation. This program provides production engineering in support of technical evaluations, failure analysis, implementation of the in-water one-side backscatter X-ray program, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) refurbishments, and field service engineering; and complete engineering design work and material tests. This program also provides drawings, configuration management information, new design and fabrication technology, incorporation of lessons learned and required testing, and construct sub-element to confirm single-stage cure.\n\nUNDERSEA WARFARE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (USW-DSS) (Cost Code VM601):\nUSW-DSS is the Navy Program of Record (PoR) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Command & Control (C2) Net-Centric system supporting warfighters. USW-DSS is a C2 capability identified in the ASW Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), for the Sea Combat Commander (SCC) and Theater USW Commander (TUSWC). USW-DSS enables effective planning and execution of undersea warfare (USW) operations, optimizes placement of sensors for exploitation of the environment, manages available resources, balances operations versus risk, and provides a clear vulnerability assessment of the operational environment. Tactical data such as tracks, environmental, and sensor processing data is ingested into USW-DSS through platform specific interfaces such as the AN\/SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar system, the Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), and CV-TSC. USW-DSS processes this and other tactical data and supports intelligent dissemination of the data to unit level and theater level platforms in support of an enhanced USW tactical picture. USW-DSS provides USW Commanders with an expanded, net-centric USW collaborative capability across Carrier Strike Group (CSG) platforms (CVNs, CGs, DDGs) as well as supporting shore nodes to include Commander Task Force (CTF), Naval Oceanographic Processing Facility (NOPF), and Tactical Operations Center (TOC), Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (M-TOC). Future USW-DSS capability is phased to deliver timely and cost-effective software improvements to the warfighter via the Fleet Capability Release (FCR) process. This program procures and installs USW-DSS on CSG platforms and supporting shore nodes via permanent ship alterations (SHIPALTs). In FY 2009 USW-DSS transitioned to a software application hosted on the Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS) and in FY 2014 started installing as part of the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES). Workstation procurements are required to support the ISNS and CANES configured ships as well as shore nodes. USW-DSS capability is phased to effectively deliver software improvements to the warfighter. The current software version, Build 2 Release 3 (B2R3), will continue to field until the follow-on Build 3 (B3) is fielded in FY 2019. In FY 2021, non-recurring engineering effort will begin to field Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) upgrades to USW-DSS systems with the integrated Common Operational Picture (COP), to shore nodes operating in the multi-level security environment.\n\n[P40A \/ VM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC)]: VM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC)\n\n[P40A \/ CV-TSC Technology Insert\/Refresh & ECP Implementation]: VM301 - CV-TSC Technology Insert\/Refresh & ECP Implementation: Consists of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and hardware\/software changes\/upgrades to previously fielded and in-production AN\/SQQ-34 systems.

Tech Refreshes improve software scalability while keeping future hardware costs in check. USW-DSS software is currently hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) and implements a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). USW-DSS Tech Refresh will install an integrated, near-real time, net-centric ASW Common Tactical Picture (CTP) \/ Common Operational Picture (COP) on an electronic Master Tactical Plot (eMTP) for the Fleet and critical shore command sites.\n\n[P40A \/ Engineering Changes (ECs)]: VM601 - USW-DSS\/Engineering Changes: Consists of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and hardware\/software changes\/upgrades.

Through USW-DSS Tech Refresh targeted architectural improvements, Build 3 Fleet Change Request-1 (FCR-1) and follow-on FCRs will facilitate the migration of key components of USW-DSS onto existing installed systems in Fleet use. Tech Refreshes improve software scalability while keeping future hardware costs in check. USW-DSS software is currently hosted on the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) and implements a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). USW-DSS Tech Refresh will install an integrated, near-real time, net-centric ASW Common Tactical Picture (CTP) \/ Common Operational Picture (COP) on an electronic Master Tactical Plot (eMTP) for the Fleet and critical shore command sites.",

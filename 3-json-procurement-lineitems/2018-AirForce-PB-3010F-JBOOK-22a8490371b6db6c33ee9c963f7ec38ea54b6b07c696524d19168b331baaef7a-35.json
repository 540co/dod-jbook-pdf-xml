Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras. Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states,\" The United States shall begin budgeting no later than Fiscal Year 2014 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors.(U)\" Additionally, current cameras are nearly obsolete, frequently unreliable, hard and increasingly expensive to maintain, and repair parts must be individually manufactured. In addition, the web film manufacturers are discontinuing production of the film stock.\n\nThis camera replacement program will replace the wet film cameras with modern, digital cameras. This program will result in modern, digital cameras with higher reliability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The customer of the imagery will be able to more readily use the imagery products and the equipment service life will be extended significantly.\n\nOC-135B fleet consists of two aircraft. Both aircraft will be modified. One aircraft will be modified during development using RDT&E funds. Each aircraft will receive one A-kit and two B-kits to comply with treaty requirements."

F-15E Radar Modernization Program (RMP), designated the APG-82(V)1, replaces 217 legacy F-15E radars with an active electronically scanned array radar, using existing technology from other DOD platforms.  It solves parts obsolescence problems and provides improved reliability and performance, including air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. It also provides for future growth.\n\nThese funds will be used to support depot stand-up\/activation for the F-15E APG-82(V)1 radar, also known as the Radar Modernization Program (RMP)."

Additionally, this effort will address safety requirements; Federal Aviation Administration, DoD and engineering mandates; and configuration changes.  This effort includes funding for the UH-1N System Program Office (e.g., A&AS, support, travel).  The funds budgeted over the FYDP will enable the SLEP of up to 63 aircraft required to meet mission requirements until a UH-1N replacement helicopter can be fielded."

Demonstration and validation of improved manufacturing process that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and weapon systems life cycle costs; energy conservation initiatives; pollution prevention opportunity assessments; and recovery\/recycling to minimize hazardous waste. These activities meet Air Force pollution prevention goals and reduce the AF ownership cost of the facilities and weapon systems.

                        "val": "Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability.  ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces.   ATP capabilities, such as high resolution imagery, eye safe laser, high system reliability and smaller deployment footprint provide greater combat effectiveness across several mission areas, including suppression\/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD\/DEAD), precision air interdiction, close air support (CAS), non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NT-ISR), reconnaissance, and time-sensitive targeting.  This funding supports the production, qualification and integration of ATPs to include all activities necessary for fielding. It includes, but is not limited to, Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) procurements, OFP verification\/qualification testing and integration efforts, Interim Contractor Logistics (ICS) support, containers, site activations, technical data packages, depot standup and program management support. Laser Infrared Targeting and Navigating (LITENING) and Sniper are ATPs currently used by the active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) is the next increment in ATP capability.  Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) and Pave Penny systems will be phased out as new ATP and ATP-SE systems are acquired. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.\n\nFY17 OCO funds of $8.4M will be used for procurement modification on the Advanced Targeting Pods to add Eye-Safe Spot Tracker\/Laser Spot Search.  Eye-safe Laser Spot Tracker\/Laser Spot Search is essential for protection of US ground and coalition forces during the combat identification process.  The capability will prevent  potential eye damage to friendly forces during ID of targets in urban Environments. \n\n\n\n_____\n\nSchedules and quantities are adjusted based upon COCOM priorities."

Fiscal Year Defense Plan funding provides the required U.S. contribution for projects defined by the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control (NAEWC) Board of Directors and approved by the U.S. government.  These projects include but are not limited to the Follow-on Upgrade Program (FUP I) and future modernization projects.  The Follow-on Upgrade program satisfies international airspace mandates for upgraded Communications Navigation Surveillance\/Air Traffic Management (CNS\/ATM) as well as transponder upgrades for Mode 5 and Enhanced Mode S and includes planning activities for a FUP II effort.  Future efforts include but are not limited to FUP II efforts and other modernization projects.  These future projects will enable the aircraft to maintain interoperability, meet emerging military requirements and sustain the NATO fleet for the future needs of NATO."

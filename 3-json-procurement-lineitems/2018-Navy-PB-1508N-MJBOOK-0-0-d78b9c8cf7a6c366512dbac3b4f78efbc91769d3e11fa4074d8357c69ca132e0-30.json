This line also supports the efforts which assigns authority to the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane, Indiana and delegates authority to the Expeditionary Systems Evaluation Division (ESED) at NSWC Crane, to perform Marine Corps ground delivered class V(W) ammunition systems assessment, test and evaluation, and engineering support."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "The FY 2018 funding request was increased by $3.202M to address increased ammunition surveillance efforts to maintain a robust inventory.\n\nIn FY 2018 Ammunition Modernization funding will support the modernization of ammunition including, rockets, line charges, components, missiles and quality evaluation. Funding will support the efforts associated with service life accelerated age testing, malfunctions, and quality assurance. The quality assurance program ascertains the safety, reliability, performance, and combat readiness of ammunition assets.  Ammo modernization addresses life cycle management of ammunition through cyclic tests, surveillance, and destructive testing (degradation and trends).  \n\nThe increase in funding from FY17 to FY18 supports increases in the level of effort to modernize and sustain the USMC ammunition inventory, which includes Rockets, Line Charges, Artillery, Tanks, Ancillary Components, Small Arms and Missiles. The USMC has experienced historically high procurements of ammunition and as result has a robust inventory.  With its procurement dollars reduced it is necessary to protect its previous investments with an appropriate surveillance, quality assurance and maintenance program. This funding supports these life cycle management functions to maintain the USMC ammunition inventory through quality assurance programs which are vital to predicting service life trends and keeping the warfighter safe during training and operational scenarios."

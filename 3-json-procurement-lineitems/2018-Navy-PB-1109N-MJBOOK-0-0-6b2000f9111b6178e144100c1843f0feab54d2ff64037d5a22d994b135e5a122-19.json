            "val": "Funding supports the procurement of communication and electrical items such as cameras, reproduction equipment, laptops, software, satellite dishes, and items\/upgrades with a unit cost under $5M in support of the Marine Corps. \n\nCombat Camera Systems (CCS):  Provides equipment to Fleet Marine Force (FMF) Combat Camera Units and training commands.  This imagery acquisition\/production equipment is used for collecting, editing and dissemination of imagery used to support the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), to include Department of Defense (DoD), Joint and Marine Forces, and supporting establishments.  This program standardizes equipment\/systems and replaces worn out, unserviceable or obsolete acquisition\/production equipment.  Procurements are centrally managed and are non-developmental, Commercial\/Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS). \n\nPublic Affairs System (PAS): Public Affairs (PA) provides the MAGTF and the broader Marine Corps the capability to research, understand and affect the information environment. PA Marines and Systems enable commanders at all levels and across the range of military operations to engage domestic and foreign publics whose trust, confidence, and understanding are mission critical. The Public Affairs Systems (PAS) Abbreviated Acquisition Program (AAP) identifies and fields materiel solutions required to research and plan communication initiatives, acquire still and video visual information, produce and disseminate communication products, and assess the effects of communication initiatives within the information environment. The program maintains an evolutionary approach to acquisitions, and leverages commercial industry-standard non-developmental items to provide the best value to the Marine Corps, while keeping PA Marines appropriately equipped to understand and affect the information environment. \n\nMarine Civil Information Management System (MARCIMS):  MARCIMS is a system of systems comprised of people, process and technology that operates in the full Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) environment.  It is a force multiplier which allows the Commander to leverage the process of Planning, Collection, Consolidation, Analysis, Production, and sharing of civil information to support the visualization and understanding of the civil environment to the military Commander's decision making process.  Program name has changed from Civil Affairs Capability Set and Civil Affairs Information Data Processing System (CIMDPS).\n\nSafety: Risk Management Information (RMI) initiative to deploy a Department of Navy (DON)-wide, web based solution facilitating unit-level Safety Program management and provides aggregate reporting, analysis, and tracking of all hazards and reportable mishaps. IAW 2011 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy and guidance by the DON Chief Information Officer, RMI will involve the fielding of an overarching, single site safety portal or architecture critical for complying with OSD safety reporting requirements and for allowing seamless on-demand access to the pool of existing safety and safety-related databases.\n\nMAGTF Logistics Support Systems (MLSS) -   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices encompass a variety of read and write data storage technologies that are used to improve accuracy, timeliness, and handling.  These technologies are key in and provide near-real time Total Asset Visibility data used to influence critical decisions by Operational Commanders. RFID enhances our force in readiness by coordinating, synchronizing and automatically transferring data by means of Active Radio Frequency Identification (aRFID), as well as the software required to create and manage the devices, collect the information and integrate that information with other logistics data. These devices can be interrogated using a variety of means, including fixed infrastructures and portable systems. The information obtained from those interrogations is provided electronically to various Automated Information Systems (AIS). The RFID project provides procurement and life cycle management of the current RFID Infrastructures, and provides RFID Hardware and Software under the Joint Army Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD AMIS) Procurement Office.\n\nEnterprise Logistics Support Systems (ELSS) -  Transportation Systems Portfolio (TSP) provides funding that supports the USMC Deployment and Execution Support Systems and the Distribution Management Support Systems and Fair Share costs to Joint Program Management Office Systems.  These systems and applications support the planning, deployment, distribution, sustainment and redeployment of supplies, equipment and personnel.  The TSP portfolio applications utilize Automated Identification Technology (AIT) read\/write devices, aRFID tags and satellite tracking systems.

Thermal imagers operate by discerning the temperature variation between targets and their background and are completely passive devices.  Thermal imagers can be used not only for target detection and engagement with Marine Corps individual and crew-served weapons; they can be used for all-weather surveillance as well; and continue coordination with United States Army on optic, thermal, and night vision technologies.\n\nManpower Operations Systems (MOS).   MOS is a portfolio of enterprise information technology systems and modules that support manpower business operations for the Total Force (active and reserve).  The investment funding in the portfolio improves dataflow and increases reliability, functionality, and accuracy of data while reducing the manpower required to operate and maintain these systems\/operations.  Development is partially driven by regulatory and policy changes mandated by Congress, DoD, DoN, and USMC.  The systems support all five tiers of Manpower: Individual Marine; Small Unit Leader; Unit, Installation Personnel Administration Center\/Disbursing Echelon; Headquarters Marine Corps Manpower and Reserve Affairs\/ Department of Finance Accounting Service.  The MOS portfolio provides support in functional areas such as Permanent Change of Station assignments, retention, mobilization, manpower planning, line of duty determination, personnel accountability, individual augmentation, personnel records management and maintenance, management of case incidents, civilian professional development planning, pay entitlement determinations, promotion and performance evaluations and self service\/ visibility of personnel data.  MOS interfaces with other systems to provide manpower data and web services functionality for pay and personnel transactions between systems.  Systems in the portfolio include Web-enabled Manpower Assignment Support System, Performance Evaluation System, Total Force Retention System, Optical Digital Imaging- Records Management System, Automated Performance Evaluation System and the Manpower Mobilization Assignment System.  Additionally, the portfolio includes Total Force Administration System associated modules:  including Drill Management Module and Secure Personnel Accountability Module.\n\nItem Unique Identification (IUID) - Provides the necessary hardware to exploit an IUID enabled ground fleet inventory of equipment and material.  This capability will allow for the identification and tracking of tangible items by using the Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) used globally as a common key.  IUID will improve logistics functions for operational commanders, program managers, equipment accountability managers, maintainers and force planners, as well as, ensure accurate systems valuation to support a clean financial audit."

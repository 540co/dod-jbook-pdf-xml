Funding supported capability development of a Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS);  documentation; operating concepts development; system and operation integration; employment tactics, and training at a Pentagon site.\n \nThis FY 2019 budget request funds procurement of physical security vehicles assigned to missions in high threat OCONUS locations.  Request reflects the life-cycle replacement cost for one Commercial Heavy Armored Vehicle (CHAV) that supports the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and OSD Senior officials providing a secure and reliable ground transportation capability.  CHAVs are armored to various levels of protection and are on platforms of varying sizes and gross vehicle weights, dependent upon the level of threat and the operating environment.  In addition to the CHAVs request, the line item includes life-cycle replacement cost of information technology (IT) equipment which directly supports the mission of the Washington Headquarters Services White House Military Office (WHMO) that provides essential services to the President that helps to maintain continuity of operations (COOP)."

It sustained Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding was used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ."

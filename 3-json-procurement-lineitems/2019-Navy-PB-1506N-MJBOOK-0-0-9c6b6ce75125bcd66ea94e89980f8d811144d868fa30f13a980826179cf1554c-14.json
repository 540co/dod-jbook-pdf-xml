            "val": "Beginning in FY 2019, the RQ-21A Blackjack Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) program is consolidated and transitions from being funded in Budget Line Items (BLI) 4737 (RQ-21 UAS) and 4787 (UAS Payloads) Procurement, Marine Corps (PMC) to BLI 0444 (STUASLO) Aircraft Procurement, Navy (APN).\n\nCurrent inventory of USN RQ-21 systems has been satisfied, therefore, after FY2017, there are no further USN RQ-21A BLACKJACK system procurements. The USMC, however, continues to fund RQ-21A BLACKJACK system procurements in FY2018 with Procurement, Marine Corps (PMC), Budget Line Item (BLI) 4737 and 4787.  There are no plans to buy more USMC RQ-21 systems at this time, however attrition air vehicles will be procured.\n\nThe requirement for the RQ-21A BLACKJACK (formerly known as The Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS)) Unmanned Aircraft System is defined in Capability Development Document, dated 18 November 2008 and further defined in the Capability Production Document, dated 15 February 2013.  The RQ-21A BLACKJACK program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition process as an Acquisition Category III program on 26 July 2010.  On 19 August 2014, RQ-21A BLACKJACK was designated an Acquisition Category II program.\n\nThe RQ-21A BLACKJACK is a combined United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) program that provides persistent maritime and land-based tactical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance\/Target Acquisition support for tactical level maneuver decisions and unit level force defense\/force protection for Naval amphibious assault ships (multi-ship classes) and Navy and Marine land forces. This system will support Naval Missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and provide support for Naval Units operating from sea\/shore in Overseas Contingency Operations.\n\nThe RQ-21A BLACKJACK system will continue to evolve and upgrade capabilities to satisfy capabilities shortfalls, new requirements, and reliability, maintainability and safety issues.  Upgraded capabilities may include Navy Command and Control integration, Weapons integration, Heavy Fuel Engine, Laser Designator, Frequency Agile Communications Relay, Digital Common Data Link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-Optical\/Infrared camera.  RQ-21A BLACKJACK will also continue to expand its shipboard capability across new ship classes. \n\nAn RQ-21A system consists of five air vehicles, two ground control stations, modular multi-mission plug and play payloads, one launcher, one recovery system, and support equipment. Standard payloads include a turret mounted EO\/IR camera and a communications relay package with automated identification ship capability, carried in the payload bay."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $14.866\n\nFY2019 baseline funds are required to procure 2 USMC attrition air vehicles, ancillary equipment to alleviate Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability gaps caused by rapidly changing missions, threats and technologies, procurement of infrastructure hardware, equipment, and labor costs associated with actual amphibious ship class installations, engineering support and installation costs for Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) platform.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2019 OCO Request: $35.065\n\nFY2019 OCO funds are required to procure 22 attrition air vehicles to replace air vehicles projected to be lost to mishap during theater operations between Naval Special Warfare (NSW) first flight in 2Q FY17 and the end of FY19, as well as product engineering support for the procurements.  OCO requirements are in support of Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) in theater operations."

One (1) additional FY15 funded RQ-21 System (total 4) was procured via the FY16 Lot 5 contract as a result of The Department of the Navy's Congressional Notification of the use of Buy to Budget authority under 10 U.S.C. 2308 received on 20 June, 2016.  Therefore, only three (3) RQ-21 Systems were procured via the FY16 Lot 5 contract in FY17 from the original plan of 4 (four).  No delivery schedule delays.",

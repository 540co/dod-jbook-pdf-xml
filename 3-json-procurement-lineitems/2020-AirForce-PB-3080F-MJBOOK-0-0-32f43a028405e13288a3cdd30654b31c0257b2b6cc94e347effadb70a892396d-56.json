            "val": "This program funds procurement of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). It includes, but is not limited to, equipment to support the bed down of deployed forces (personnel, aircraft and support equipment) at austere and semi-austere locations. BEAR assets are a critical Agile Combat Support enabler for the Expeditionary Air Force.  Prepositioned War Reserve Capabilities (PWRCs) (ashore and afloat) place military unit type equipment and supplies at or near the point of planned use to reduce reaction time and ensure timely support of a specific force during the initial phases of an operation. These assets provide combatant commanders with initial capabilities and materiel until establishment of a mature and sustained Strategic\/Theater Distribution Network (TDP). (CJSCI 4310.01D)\nBEAR is one of five FORCE Generation Sets (FGS) and is composed of multiple air base capability packages to include: feeding, hygiene, water production, power production, airfield lighting, shelters, aircraft arresting systems, and environmental support equipment. FGS-BEAR provides personnel, infrastructure, and flight line support at forward operating sites (Establish the Base, Operate the Base) The program provides funding to procure new and replacement equipment items, and multi-media packages required to support BEAR training facilities at Silver Flag Sites, Regional Training Sites, Technical Schools, Technical Certification Centers, Services Combat Center Training, 635MMG, and Eagle Flag. Costs include inventory reconstitution, spares and consumables, repairs, and procurement of new equipment for upgrades or full UTC's replacement. This program serves a critical role in support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOM) requirements to support 5 Major OPLANS, and ensures the objectives of the Asian Pacific Stability and European Defense Initiatives can be executed.\nThe AF continues to modernize major BEAR components to replace obsolete and inefficient items (e.g., Power Generation, Hygiene, Refrigeration, EALS, MAAS, Shelters, and Feeding): \n\nForce Module Water System: Water System takes non-potable water and converts it into potable water. The system is modular and scalable in design and consists of Source Run, Water Production, Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), Initial, Follow-on, and Industrial Operations, Flight line Extension, freeze protection, grey water recovery, pumping, piping, and storage equipment; applicable fittings; and other components such as fluid control valves. \n\nPower System: Consists of prime and secondary power equipment which provides the capability to generate and distribute power to billeting, feeding, flight line and industrial operations at forward deployed sites. The primary power source for BEAR bed down locations is the BEAR Power Unit (BPU). The BPU is an 800 kilowatt (kW) Tier II compliant diesel generator. The power from the BPU is distributed through buried high voltage cabling and stepped down to facility power through the Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). The SDC is a 150 kilovolt-ampere (KVA) transformer capable of supporting twelve (12) billeting shelters via the Primary Distribution Panels (PDP). \n\nExpeditionary Airfield Lighting System (EALS)(Legacy): Light Emitting Diode (LED) and incandescent runway lighting system designed to be rapidly installed at contingency airfields and at other locations that need temporary airfield lighting. The lighting kit for runways includes runway edge and threshold lights, precision approach path indicator (PAPI), and strobe approach lights, distance to go marker lamps, taxi way lamps and battery-operated obstruction lights. The EALS also includes the generators, cables, control cables, transformers and regulators. The entire system is packaged on six (6) mobile trailers. System will be replaced with a Next Generation System over the FYDP.\n\nMobile Aircraft Arresting System: This air transportable barrier arresting Bak-12 mounted on a mobile trailer to accommodate the recovery of fighter aircraft returning to battle damaged airfield. \n\nHygiene: Hygiene includes Shower, Shave and Latrine, WH-400 water heaters for initial Hygiene fielding and Self Help Laundry system which provides personal hygiene facilities in support of BEAR bases. \n\nShelters: Shelters vary in sizes and are needed for billeting, kitchen, hygiene, and aircraft and equipment maintenance. Includes lighting, electrical equipment, environmental control units, remote area lighting, Shelter Flies, Shelter Flooring\/matting for various shelter sizes, Shelter liners. \n\nFeeding: BEAR Feeding includes kitchen and all applicable equipment. BEAR Feeding system provides the capability to prepare, and then serve, 500 meals over a two hour serving period, twice per day (24 hour period). The Feeding system is worldwide deployable and supports numerous basing options. This system supports initial mission requirements and follow-on high mobility feeding requirements for rapidly deployable mobility packages and other contingencies in all theaters of operation. \n\nHeating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC): provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.\n\nEnvironmental Control Unit (ECU): Heat Pump to provide cooling, heating via reversing valve (heat pump) and supplemental heat via resistance heat strips.\n\nTraining\/Multi-Media Training - Provides BEAR and items for all training sites and funds for all required BEAR multi-media training requirements.\n\n\"Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 BEAR received its first distribution of OCO funds to support the European Defense Initiative\": $73.983 million was received to start the procurement of BEAR commodities required to fill the 24 Deployable Air Base Systems (DABS) needed to \"Set the Theatre \n\n\"Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 BEAR received a funding plus-up of $36M dollars to address equipment disconnects to support emergent warfighter readiness requirements in the Pacific Theatre. \n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2018 BEAR received a Congressional Mark in the amount of $5M dollars (Feeding Earmark) to replace aging Legacy 9-2 kitchen systems.\n\nProgram element associated with this P-1 Line is: 0401135F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

It will also provide for Program Management Administration (PMA) and other government associated costs in support installation and unit mission requirements for Air Force personnel."

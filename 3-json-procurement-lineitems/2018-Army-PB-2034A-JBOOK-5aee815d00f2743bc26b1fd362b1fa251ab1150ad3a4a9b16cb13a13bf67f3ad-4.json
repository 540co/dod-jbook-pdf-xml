The projectile consists of a heavy walled steel body charged with an explosive mix and an incendiary mix.  The M940 is currently being employed as a force protection munition in the M61 cannon of the Land Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) for Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM).  It is effective against light armor at 1,000 meters and against airborne and light surface targets at 2,000 meters.  The projectile self-destructs at 2,300 meters, minimizing collateral surface damage when engaging airborne targets.  The M940 replaced the M246 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer, Self-Destroying (HEI-T-SD) as the primary air defense cartridge.  This item is Code A, approved for service use."

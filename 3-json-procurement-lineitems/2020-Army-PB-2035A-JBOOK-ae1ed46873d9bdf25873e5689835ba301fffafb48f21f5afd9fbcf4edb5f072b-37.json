The current environment constrains training capabilities and capacity, but lacks a joint or standard approach consistent with a broader vision of PCTE. PCTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, \"Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations,\" dated 17 November 2015. The U.S. Army acknowledges it is the lead service to perform as the Executive Agent (EA) for Cyber Training Ranges and DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE. Program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645."

It will also provide the hardware end points at the training facility.  In addition, procurement funding will support the migration of PCTE to DoD enterprise networks and to Government and\/or Commercial cloud environments."

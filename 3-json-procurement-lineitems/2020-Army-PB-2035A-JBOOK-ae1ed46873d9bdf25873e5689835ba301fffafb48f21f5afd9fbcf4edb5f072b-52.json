            "val": "The Army Program of Record for biometrics tactical collection capability is presently the BAT-A.  It consists of the BAT-A Kit, BAT-A Handheld, and BAT-A Web Service.  This capability supports the Identity Dominance Mission and Army Force Protection Mission.  The BAT-A system collects, matches, stores, and shares biometric and contextual information on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A system is also used by Military Intelligence personnel, Infantry, and Military Police.   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone for over 19 years.  Today, BAT-A supports Operation Freedom's Sentinel.\n\nThe Next Generation Biometrics Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement system for current Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army tactical biometrics collection capability.  NXGBCC will be an integrated system of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software, comprising a kit, data base, and transport architecture.  NXGBCC will be capable of operating on multiple communications networks and achieve near real-time identity matching and data synchronization.  NXGBCC will add to the number of biometric modalities collected, provide matches to the Warfighter in less than 3 minutes, increase the data sharing capability, and reduce weight, power, and cost.  NXGBCC will use a Local Trusted Source composed of a distributed database capable of being used worldwide, data management software, forward biometric matching software, and an analysis portal.  Also, the NXGBCC collection kit(s) will be composed of 1 or more collection devices, a credential\/badge device, and document scanning device.  In accordance with HQDA-G8 equipping plan, FY21-FY24 funding will enable the department to equip 2 Infantry Brigade Combat Teams and Training."

            "val": "FY 2020 OCO procurement in the amount of $1.800 million continues to procure BAT-A Kit Hardware and BAT-A Handheld accessories for RESET\/REFRESH activities supporting Operation Freedom's Sentinel.  Requested funds will refresh 2 BAT-A Servers; Scanner Devices (150 Fingerprint and 150 Iris); 250 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A HH parts and accessories ensuring the availability of this mission critical capability. \n\nBAT-A requires both hardware reset and associated minor software integration to maintain operational viability.  These devices have been deployed in combat operations for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  BAT-A is the Army's Biometric Program of Record and failure to reset these devices will degrade the mission effectiveness of this enabler of Identity Dominance and Force Protection.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions."

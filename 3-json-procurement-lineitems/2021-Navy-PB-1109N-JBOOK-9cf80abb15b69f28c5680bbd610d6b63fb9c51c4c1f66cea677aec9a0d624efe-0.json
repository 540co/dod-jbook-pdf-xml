            "val": "The AAV7A1 Product Improvement Program (PIP) is comprised of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) Modifications Line and, previously, the AAV Survivability Upgrade (AAV SU) program.  \n\nThe AAV Modifications Line includes life-cycle support to ensure cost-effective combat readiness for the AAV Family of Vehicles (FOV). This is accomplished through continuous review of sub-systems to maintain system supportability, safety, procurement of replacement systems for obsolescence, and fielding of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) for capability-based improvements of fleet assets, reduced total ownership cost initiatives, and improved AAV sustainment initiatives. The AAV Modifications Line procures modernized components and subsystems that impact safe and reliable use of AAV such as Intercom Modernization, Tactical Communication Modernization (TCM), technical refresh of servers and laptops for Command-variant (C-Variant), and associated support for the AAV FOV.  These modifications support the extension of the AAV life cycle until 2030.  \n\nThe AAV SU was a capability-based upgrade program centered on material upgrades in survivability and force protection while maintaining the required land and water mobility performance.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) decided to terminate the AAV SU program in order to better align to the National Defense Strategy; the remaining AAV SU funding will be utilized for program cancellation, which is expected to take between 12-24 months to complete."

            "val": "FY 2019: $96.836M ($96.514M Active; $0.322M Reserve). The AAV program procured fleet-wide Vehicle Modifications including Emergency Egress Lighting System (EELS) Power Units and spares, Recovery-variant corrosion improvements, Intercom Modernization procurements and Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) for Personnel-variants, continued hardware\/software technical refresh and Cybersecurity for the Command-variants; plus related Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Production Engineering Support, Support Equipment, and Technical Publications for the AAV family of vehicles. The FY 2020 enactment includes congressional rescission of $74.756M to FY 2019 funding.\n\nFY 2020:  $39.495M ($39.166M Active; $0.329M Reserve).  The AAV program procures fleet-wide Vehicle Modifications including initial procurement of Assured Position Navigation and Timing (APNT) systems, continues procurement of Remote Weapon Stations (RWS), and continues hardware\/software technical refresh for the Command-variants; plus related Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Production Engineering Support, Support Equipment, and Technical Publications for the AAV family of vehicles. The APNT system provides the AAV driver during the ship-to-shore maneuvers the ability to navigate a preplanned course while coming ashore and to stay within a lane that has been cleared of naval mines and other obstacles.  The RWS allows on-the-move target acquisition and first-burst target engagement.  It supports the MK-19 grenade launcher and M2 .50 cal machine gun.  The RWS replaces the current obsolescent Up Gun Weapon System that is a leading deadlining subsystem on the AAV. The hardware\/software technical refresh for the Command-variants have software releases quarterly each year to maintain the vehicles security certification. The net decrease of $57.341 between FY 2019 and FY 2020 is due to the combination of 1) the cancellation of the AAV Survivability Upgrade and associated termination costs in FY 2019 and 2) the increase in support for vehicle modification to replace obsolete vehicle radios for the AAV Family of Vehicles.\n\nFY 2021 Base Appropriation Request:  $87.476M ($87.142M Active; $0.334M Reserve).  The AAV program will procure fleet-wide Vehicle Modifications including Tactical Communication Modernization, APNT, Remote Weapon Stations (RWS), and will continue hardware\/software technical refresh for the Command-variants; plus related Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Production Engineering Support, Support Equipment, and Technical Publications for the AAV family of vehicles. The TCM replaces the current fielded radios. The radios will be obsolete by 2024 due to the NSA cryptographic modernization mandate and will be unable to communicate with other units.  The net increase of $47.981M between FY 2020 and FY 2021 is due to the initial procurement of TCM as the replacement for obsolete radios in the AAV Family of Vehicles and the continued procurement of Remote Weapons Stations.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2021 OCO Appropriation Request: N\/A"

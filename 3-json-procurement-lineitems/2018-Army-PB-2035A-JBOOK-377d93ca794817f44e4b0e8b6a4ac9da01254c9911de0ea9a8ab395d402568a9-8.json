            "val": "The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is a passive, space-based, radio positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system providing precise time, three dimensional position, navigation and velocity information to Warfighters. Accurate positioning, navigation and timing are critical enablers to all Army Warfighting capabilities. Timing is a key enabler to tactical communications networks.The NAVSTAR GPS program is designated as a DoD Space Program and the United States Air Force (USAF) is the executive service. The USAF GPS Directorate develops enabling technologies and products for GPS User Equipment (PE 35164F), with direct Army management and participation. The Army implements these technologies into Army architectures and user equipment.  The Army NAVSTAR GPS program provides for management, procurement, fielding and support of Army GPS User Equipment. GPS User Equipment consists of a family of Selective-Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based PNT Capability solutions which span aviation users, ground users, host vehicles, and sensors. Current GPS User Equipment is comprised of a dual-use dismounted handheld or system-installed Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), DAGR Distributed Device (D3) for distributed PNT on platforms, and Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB-GRAM) for embedded PNT.\n\nPublic Law 111-383 Section 913 (January 2011) Authorizes FY 2017 and beyond appropriations to only procure GPS equipment capable of receiving the military code, commonly known as M-code, if M-code capable equipment is available.\n\nCurrent Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the DAGR\/D3 is 462,288 units."

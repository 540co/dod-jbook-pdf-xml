            "val": "Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is a joint United States Navy (USN)\/United States Air Force (USAF) program with the USN as the lead service.  The JSOW program provides an air-to-ground glide weapon (AGM-154) capable of attacking a variety of targets during day, night, and adverse weather conditions for use against fixed area targets and moving maritime targets.  The JSOW enhances aircraft survivability as compared to alternate interdiction weapon systems by providing the capability for launch aircraft to standoff outside the range of most target area surface-to-air threat systems.  The JSOW Global Positioning System (GPS)\/Inertial Navigation System (INS) capability allows several target kills per aircraft sortie.\n\nThe JSOW baseline BLU-97 variant (AGM-154A) has been integrated on USN (F\/A-18C\/D\/E\/F) and USAF (F-16C\/D, B-2 and B-52) aircraft.  The JSOW BLU-108 (AGM-154B) variant provides an anti-armor\/tank capability.  The JSOW unitary variant (AGM-154C) utilizes the common airframe of the AGM-154A and AGM-154B variants and incorporates an infrared uncooled seeker with autonomous targeting acquisition.  The payload includes a 500 pound class Broach multi-stage warhead.  AGM-154C was approved for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) on 26 June 2003.  Full Rate Production (FRP) of the AGM-154C began in December 2004.  A Network Enabled Weapon (NEW) moving maritime target capability has been incorporated in JSOW-C production units (AGM-154C-1 variant) starting with the FY 2009 procurement.  The AGM-154-C-1 units retain the basic AGM-154C capability against fixed land targets."

            "val": "This line item funds modifications to UH-1N and UH-1H\/TH-1H aircraft.  The two-engine UH-1N is a light, utility helicopter primarily used for missile site and range support and distinguished visitor airlift support.  There are 62 UH-1N aircraft in the inventory.  They were built with an estimated service life of 10,000 flight hours and are not service limited due to on-going modifications and upgrades.  There are 28 TH-1H aircraft in the inventory.  They are used in the helicopter track for USAF Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training.  The TH-1H modernization modification provided a service life of 20 years, the last one was delivered in 2013.\n\nStarting in FY19 the UH-1N Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was added for a portion of the UH-1N fleet to address aging fleet problems to include: structural repairs, replacement of key systems based on structural fatigue, system obsolescence and a diminishing manufacturing industrial base.  Additionally, this effort will address safety requirements to include: Federal Aviation Administration, DoD, engineering mandates and configuration changes.  This effort includes funding for the UH-1N System Program Office (e.g., A&AS, support, travel). The funds budgeted FY 2019 - 2022 will enable the SLEP of up to 63 aircraft required to meet mission requirements until a UH-1N replacement helicopter can be fielded.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.\n\nFunding in this exhibit is contained in PE 0101235F, PE 0401314F, and PE 0804747F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

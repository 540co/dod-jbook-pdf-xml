It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.397 million support the following: At RTC, procures instrumentation that will allow in-flight data collection of Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) system performance and procure test support equipment that will stimulate the ASE systems. At YTC, procures replacement aircraft instrumentation for the time stamping, on board recording and telemetering of data from standard data buses and sensors; and on board recorders and telemetry equipment that can meet the environment and data speeds needed for production base aviation programs. Funding also replaces 15 year old Electro-Optical\/Infrared (EO\/IR) targets used for aircraft sensor resolution testing.\n\nThe majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life. This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\nAll COMPO 1 Active"

The ISSP collects COMSEC requirements, procures and fields solutions, key management capabilities and Information Assurance (IA) \/ Cyber tools to secure the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) against evolving cyber threats. \nThe ISSP supports the identification and allocation of new and emerging COMSEC capabilities required to protect Army's architectures and to replace current and legacy cryptographic systems with technologically advanced (network centric\/DoDIN compliant) devices.  AKMI is a unified, scalable, interoperable, and trusted infrastructure providing net-centric key management services to systems that rely on cryptography, serving Department of Defense (DoD) and the broader cryptographic community.\nBoth the ISSP and AKMI programs ensure Army keeps pace with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic modernization, advanced key management and network centric performance capability mandates."

The IPPS-A will subsume approximately 43 Army legacy systems across the Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard, into an integrated system.  The IPPS-A is a web-based tool, available 24 hours a day, accessible to HR professionals, combatant commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services and also provides internal controls and audit procedures that prevent erroneous payments and loss of funds.\n\nIPPS-A Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program. Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. IPPS-A Increment II will account for status changes between Active, Reserve, and National Guard components to ensure accurate service time minimizing impact on individual pay, credit for service, and other benefits as well as enable disciplined human resource management.\n\nIPPS-A Increment I and Increment II are both designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) programs."

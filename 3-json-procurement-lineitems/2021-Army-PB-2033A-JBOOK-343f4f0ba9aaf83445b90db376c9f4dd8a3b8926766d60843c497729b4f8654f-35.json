Program provides for the procurement of standard and non-standard small arms to include auxiliary components such as combat optics, protective lens coatings for optics, fire controls, suppressors, powered\/ intelligent rails, weapon mounts\/platforms, and adaptors and to meet urgent needs or initial buys. Weapons and auxiliary components procured under this budget activity in prior years consist of MK48 Machine Guns, M9 Pistols and associated Basic Issue Items (BII), M500 Mossberg Shotguns, MP5KA and APC9K Submachine Guns to include magazines, clamps, holsters, slings, lanyards, spare parts and cleaning kits. Funding will also purchase Non-Standard weapons to support the Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF) as well as limited distribution weapons\/accessories such as world class Olympic Grade marksmanship weapons and accessories to support the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and Army National Guard to include Biathlon Teams to maintain and procure the specialized target rifles\/accessories, replica M1873 ceremonial pistols for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), pistols and accessories, Air Rifles for Fort Carson Police\/Provost Marshal Division to assist with varmint control, standard and non-standard caliber Pistols and Rifles, Shooting glasses and scopes, Free Pistols, Shot Guns and bolt action rifles."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.763 million supports the Active Army by providing funding for the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and National Guard Biathlon Teams.  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis. Between competitions the AMU fires constantly to hone their skills and maintain their competitive edge resulting in high annual round counts.  Despite the high level of maintenance provided, these weapons exceed their stated effective life projections much faster than typical fielded weapons. Requiring the weapons to be coded out and replaced regularly. \nBase funding will also provide for the procurement and training of various Non-Standard Weapons to support the regionally engaged Active Army. These weapons are required to facilitate training of US Army units on host nation weapon systems prior to deployment in support of Regionally Aligned Force (RAF) missions.  In addition, the base funding will procure APC9K adapters to allow other ARMY 9mm magazines to be utilized.  \n\nThe Army will procure Biathlon Rifles for the Army National Guard Biathlon Teams.  \nFunding supports senior commanders and key personnel as High Risk Personnel (HRP).  HRPs are authorized a Personal Security Detail (PSD), which are assigned to guard against outlined threats.  To address this operational need, PSD military personnel require weapons with greater lethality than pistols that are more concealable than rifles.  The ultimate objective of this program is to acquire a highly concealable Sub Compact Weapon (SCW) system capable of engaging threat personnel with a high volume of lethal force while accurately firing at close range with minimal collateral damage.  Future Army SCW requirements are being evaluated by MCoE for FORSCOM units. Also procures small caliber rifles for the law enforcement program to control wildlife on Army Posts.  The Army will also procure ceremonial pistols for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR) at the National Training Center, Ft. Irwin, California.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

            "val": "The UH-72A platform will provide the flexibility to respond to Homeland Security (HLS) requirements, conduct civil search and rescue operations, support damage assessment, support test and training centers, perform generating force missions, augment the HH-60 Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) aircraft, and provide support to CONUS counterdrug operations. The UH-72A will conduct general support utility helicopter missions and execute tasks as part of an integrated effort with other joint services, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The UH-72A provides time-sensitive transport of supplies or key personnel, air mobility to assist civil authorities through the execution of search and rescue or disaster relief operations, advanced warning\/detection of external threats to include threats to our borders, augmentation of air ambulance capabilities, and limited command and control operations in the conduct of HLS. As part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) the UH-72A will become the primary training aircraft at the US Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) in Ft Rucker. The UH-72A program is currently in full rate production."

            "val": "-- FY18 base procurement dollars in the amount of $108.383 Million will support the procurement of 12 UH-72A Lakota aircraft, fielding, and program management for one year.\n-- FY17 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) base procurement dollars in the amount of $187 Million will support the procurement of 23 UH-72A Lakota aircraft, fielding, and program management for one year instead of the 28 aircraft as noted by the Conference.\n-- Only 12 of 28 aircraft have been procured in FY16. Army temporarily enjoined from procuring the remaining 16 aircraft. \n-- The remaining 16 aircraft deliveries beyond February 2018 reflect the enjoined aircraft as reflected on the P-21.\n\nCurrent Army Acquisition Objective is 462 aircraft. \nTotal procurement quantity of 461 includes PR attrited aircraft.  Two HAATs aircraft procured with NGB funding is not included in total quantity.\nPrior year quantity should be 426 to account for the replacement aircraft that was attrited.  FY18 should read 12.\n\nIn accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities."

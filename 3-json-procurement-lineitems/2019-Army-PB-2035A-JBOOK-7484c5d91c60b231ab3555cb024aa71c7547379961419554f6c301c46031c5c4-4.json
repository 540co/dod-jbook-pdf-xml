The ARNG requires new M997A3 Ambulances.  PD, Light Tactical Vehicles, in partnership with AM General and Rock Island Arsenal, provide new production ambulances; supporting both the organic and industrial bases.   Prior year funding supported vehicle upgrades that include vehicle reliability enhancements incorporated into HMMWV production during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom to allow for installation of armor packages, by inclusion of improved suspension and vehicle cooling system enhancements.  The modernization effort consists of vehicle disassembly and reassembly, application of designated mandatory replacement parts and compliance requirements, installation of Automotive Improvement Program and Reliability Enhancement Vehicle components, and Inspection and Repair Only as Necessary (IROAN) of the HMMWV cab.  The cab will be integrated onto a new production rolling chassis to include a new engine, engine cooling system, transmission, and suspension system. A Public Private Partnership (PPP) exists for the ARNG HMMWV Modernization Program that workloads and supports both the organic and industrial base.  \n\nCongress added 60M in FY 2016 funds for this program for HMMWV Ambulance that was realigned to SSN D15406, Ambulance, 4 Litter, 5\/4 Ton 4X4."

            "val": "Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) provides a self-contained, standardized, rapidly deployable, modular, scalable, and reconfigurable joint command and control (C2) capability to designated Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs).  DJC2 is the materiel solution to Defense Planning Guidance that called for the development of standing Joint Task Forces (JTF) with a deployable C2 capability.  DJC2 will ensure that Joint Force Commanders (JFC) are equipped as well as trained and organized to carry out their C2 responsibilities.  DJC2 provides GCCs and JFCs a mission critical, integrated family of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute and assess operations.  It is designed to deploy rapidly, set up within hours and quickly provide necessary C2 mission and collaboration functionality across the full spectrum of JTF operations.  The DJC2 has also been deployed in support of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA\/DR) efforts.  The capability is intended for all levels of conflict and will be reconfigurable to meet specific GCC and JTF mission requirements.  This capability is interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.\n\nDJC2 sites are as follows: 6 DJC2 core systems garrisoned at USSOUTHCOM Tampa, Florida (1), USEUCOM Stuttgart, Germany (1), AFRICOM (SETAF) Vicenza, Italy (1), USPACOM Camp Smith, Hawaii (1),  Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) Camp Hansen, Japan (1), and NAVEUR-NAVAF, JFC Naples, Italy (1).\n\nNote that DJC2 is not a follow-on or replacement system for the Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J); rather, DJC2 employs a suite of applications, ensuring interoperability with the worldwide-installed base of GCCS-J.\n\nFunding has been moved to BLI 2906 starting in FY 2017 as part of the BLI consolidation effort."

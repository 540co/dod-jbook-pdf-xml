CREW Dismounted capabilities are designed to protect Soldiers while conducting dismounted operations. Universal Test Set (UTS) is designed to test CREW systems before conduct of operations.\n\nOperation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) has requested dismounted systems to provide force protection for mission locations.  These systems will be developed and fielded to the CENTCOM Area of Operation (AoR) in response to Joint Urgent Operation Needs (JUON) 0533 (classified JUONs).  JUON 0533 was approved in Nov 2017. Modi II has been selected to fulfil this JUON based on CONUS and OCONUS testing along with system availability to meet the JUON's requirements.\n\nFY19 was the last year of base funding for this effort."

            "val": "The EA-18G is replacing the EA-6B aircraft. The EA-18G has the capability to operate autonomously or as a major node in a network centric operation. The performance of the aircraft is compatible with the primary strike\/fighter aircraft inventory, allowing it to be fully integrated into specific strike packages. It also has the capacity to provide broad area coverage for extended periods of time to support numerous strikes or other air operations in a federated context.  The EA-18G is a scalable, flexible solution facilitating \"Task Organized\" force structures. Task organized force structures employ adequate forces to accomplish a specific task while maintaining operational and personnel tempo at acceptable levels. The EA-18G is designed to perform a range of Electronic Warfare\/Electronic Attack functions either simultaneously or independently.  EA-18G man in the loop operation and advanced information display system allow real time assessment of the tactical situation and the appropriate response executed in accordance with the rules of engagement.The EA-18G's electronic attack upgrades meet or exceed EA-6B Airborne (with ALQ-218, ALQ-99, USQ-113) Electronic Attack capability to detect, identify, locate and suppress hostile emitters; provide enhanced connectivity to National, Theater and strike assets; and provide organic precision emitter targeting for employment of onboard suppression weapons to fulfill operational requirements.\n\nFY16 The correct aircraft quantity for the EA-18G Congressional aircraft is 7 vice 10 as the 3 A-12 In-kind Settlement aircraft are now being correctly reflected in Prior Years.  As part of the A-12 settlement, the EA-18G Program received three EA-18G airframes, Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE), and Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) kits from the Boeing Company. These aircraft are in the process of delivery and are annotated as FY13 Lot 37A aircraft. There was not a TOA increase to the program."

CCTT simulators support Commanders' home station collective training and readiness requirements in conducting pre-deployment training in preparation for worldwide combat operations. CCTT immersively and comprehensively trains Armor, Cavalry, Infantry, Mechanized Infantry and Armored Reconnaissance units from squad through Battalion\/Squadron level to include their staffs. The primary training audience operates from full-crew simulators, reconfigurable command posts and live battalion command posts to accomplish their combined arms training tasks. CCTT is a ground based, collective training device. CCTT is comprised of full fidelity, manned simulators for the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) variants and includes the Reconfigurable Vehicle Tactical Trainer (RVTT) and Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) modules. RVTT is comprised of full fidelity, manned simulators for the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). \n\nCCTT is an integral part of the Army training strategy, and through planned platform concurrency modernization."

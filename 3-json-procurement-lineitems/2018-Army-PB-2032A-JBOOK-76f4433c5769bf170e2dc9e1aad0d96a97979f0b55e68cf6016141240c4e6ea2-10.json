Front and Side Look High Resolution Electro-Optical (day) and Front Look Infrared (night) cameras allow the Warfighter to have \u201ceyes on\u201d the target for positive identification.  LMAMS\u2019 Wave-Off capability allows the operator to wave-off or re-direct the LMAMS flight path up to seconds prior to impact if necessary.  The system is comprised of a fire control unit, launcher, missile, and a modular payload capable of high lethality against unprotected Combatant Personnel and Fractional Casualty against Personnel in Soft Skinned Vehicles.  Pre-flight Component Assembly and Storage allows operation within a matter of minutes. \n\nLMAMS Procurement Quantity is the number of All Up Rounds (AUR) to be procured in the fiscal year."

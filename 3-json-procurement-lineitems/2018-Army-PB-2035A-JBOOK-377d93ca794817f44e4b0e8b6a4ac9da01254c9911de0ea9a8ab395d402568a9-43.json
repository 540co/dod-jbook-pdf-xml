The PE is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)\/Electronic Warfare system for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces. PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of Technical Insertions and Pre-Planned Product Improvements to ensure operational relevance.  PM Prophet will modernize legacy systems to provide for fleet modernization to meet the requirements of the Prophet program and match the capabilities of the Prophet Enhanced sensors and platforms currently being fielded to the Army.  In FY 2017, modifications to Prophet Enhanced began in the Modifications-In-Svc line, BZ9753.\n\nArmy Acquisition Objective (AAO): 225"

            "val": "Strategic overview:\n\nDPA Title III investments for DoD are informed by the Department's key investment strategy documents including the National Defense Strategy, and the results of the Presidential Executive Order on Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States (E.O. 13806). Investments for DoD will enable the production of capacity for technologies and materials emerging from the technology base when the private sector is unable to respond within DoD timelines. \n\nThe National Security Space Industrial and Supply Base (NSS ISB) Risk Mitigation Program was developed by the DoD to formulate a systematic process to fund mitigation efforts to rectify shortcomings in the space industrial and supply base. The objective is to ensure access to critical technologies and capabilities in the quality, quantity, and timeframes required to support U.S. Government space programs. Projects in this program are addressing cross-platform, multi-agency\/Service requirements. Projects are developed in response to risk mitigation determinations and prioritized critical requirements of stakeholders in DoD and other agencies, as represented through the Department's Space Industrial Base Working Group.\n\nThe FY 2020 request facilitates the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and the recently released Nation Defense Business Operations Plan by supporting:\n\nStrategic Goal 1:  Rebuild military readiness as we build a more lethal joint force, and\n\nStrategic Objective 1.2 - Lay the foundation for future readiness through recapitalization, innovation, and modernization\nStrategic Objective 1.3 - Enhance information technology and cybersecurity capabilities\n\nProgram Change Summary ($ in Millions)\n\nFY 2020 resources ($M):\nFY 2020 Request*:  $34.393\n   * Includes cost for program management and administrative support for projects.\n\nFY 2019 resources ($M):\nFY 2019 Request:   $38.578\nCongressional increase: +$15.000 \nTotal FY 2018 Appropriated: $53.578 \n\nFY 2018 resources ($M):\nFY 2018 Request:   $37.401 \nCongressional increase:  +$30.000\nTotal FY 2018 Appropriated:  $67.401\n\nThis budget includes essential transformational initiatives using the authorities of Title III of the DPA. Project descriptions are provided below for each of the P5 exhibit projects listed, and the single or multi-year cost phasing of each of the projects is addressed in the P5 exhibit.\n\nProject Descriptions:\n\nNSS ISB - Electron Beam Direct Write: This project addresses a need for an advanced lithography tool for government integrated circuit developments. It will have benefits in vastly reduced mask  costs, improved design turn-around times, improved yield & reliability, improved design security (trust), and increased die sizes. Production versions of this tool would be inserted in U.S. integrated circuit foundries fabricating parts for space and defense applications at a relatively low cost (versus commercial advanced lithography solutions in development) per system. The project will accomplish the first such insertion. The project is to complete the development of a piece of lithography equipment that uses multiple electron beams (e-beams) to enable the direct transfer (\"writing\") of integrated circuit layer descriptions to a physical wafer being processed. Accomplishing this project brings a host of benefits when coupled with 1 D (1-dimensional or \"unidirectional\") layout techniques as part of a complementary ebeam write (CEBW) methodology. Project was executed using available prior year funding.\n\nNSS ISB - Photovoltaic Production Enhancements: The purpose of this effort is to help domestic companies maintain their performance lead over foreign competitors by expanding production of AIAA S-111 space-qualified photovoltaic solar cells with improved cost and performance efficiencies. Performance improvements include characterizing high-efficiency inverted metamorphic (IMM) solar cells grown on Gallium Arsenide substrates as a drop-in replacement for ZTJ triple-junction solar cells, and completing the qualification of the IMM solar cells to the AIAA S-111A standard. Other improvements on high-efficiency XTJ Prime triple- junction solar cells grown on Germanium substrates include of increasing the cell Beginning-of-Life efficiency and reduce End-of-Life cost per watt. \n\nNSS ISB - Next Generation Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA): This project addresses a need for a multiple-phase Next-Generation scalable Reaction Wheel (NGRW) project to provide a systematic comprehensive, low cost\/risk investment affording potential for high return on investment. The goal is to generate or revive a domestic competitor, or to expand the existing vendor's product line, with a focus on smaller wheels using advanced technologies. In addition, investigate encouraging a business partnership to maintain a second source in the U.S. Also, the project will investigate using another product controlled by a U.S. company. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Digital\/Analog Production & Qualification: This funds work at the 45nm and 14nm nodes.  It is imperative that government organizations responsible for national security, e.g., intelligence acquisition, missile early warning, missile defense, and other space requirements maintain a strong industrial base to supply technology necessary to design, develop, and fabricate Trusted, radiation hardened, high reliability and DoD space qualified Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP), such as very high speed data switches, and Multi-Core General Purpose Processors (MCGPP) at the less than or equal to 45nm technology node to support onboard processing and other critical applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the Radiation Hardened By Design, design flow, optimize selected circuit designs to reduce power and increase performance and complete the design, fabrication, test and qualification of certain critical devices to include the MC-GPP. In addition to achieving an estimated improvement in performance of > 25% for power and performance for some specific designs, the proposed effort will support life-time acquisition buys of these critical circuits for some identified systems with attendant reductions in system technical, cost and schedule risks. Project was initiated using available prior year funding.\n\nNSS ISB - Trusted Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs): The DoD and Intelligence Community have identified FPGAs as a critical enabling technology across a wide variety of present and future systems. Advanced, commercially available FPGAs do not meet the DoD requirements for Trusted systems as they are manufactured off-shore and are considered vulnerable to tampering and insertion of malicious software and\/or hardware.  This program seeks to improve the security posture and reduce the risk associated with FPGA technology by addressing security concerns in the design, development, fabrication and supply lifecycle of FPGA devices. The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate an approach to ensure the availability of advanced \"Trusted\" and space qualified reprogrammable FPGA technology to support DoD\/IC applications including satellite and strategic missile systems. Concerning this effort \"Trust\" is defined as assurance of the integrity and availability, of a product wherein that product will reliably operate as intentionally designed and not contain any malicious hardware and\/or software that will compromise the intended application; e.g., exfiltration of sensitive data, etc. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements. \n\nNSS-ISB - Radiation Test Facilities: Radiation test facilities remain a critical asset to NSS and all of DoD to be able to quantify and qualify the radiation hardness of electronic components. This funding will upgrade and sustain these facilities to fulfill this need. As program budgets shrink in upcoming years, programs are less willing to sustain these facilities, leaving the burden on SMC and the NRO to fund them out of their ever shrinking O&M budget. Without assistance, one of the critical facilities will close (costing over $1B to reconstitute). Without the current test infrastructure, the DoD would be very under capacity for this capability. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nNSS ISB - High Strength\/High Modulus (HS\/HM) Carbon Fibers: This investment program will ensure there is a domestic industry of qualified to produced High Strength and High Modulus (HS\/HM) carbon fibers for NSS and Defense applications. The program's purpose is to reduce inherent supply chain risks associated with a sole source foreign producer in Japan of unique and proprietary level materials while making available to DoD existing domestic second sources of similar materials that are reportedly higher quality, better performing and less expensive. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nNSS ISB - Mercury Cadmium Telluride Infrared Sensors: The goal of this program is to establish and maintain a high quality production capability for Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) epitaxy grown on Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at key US-owned and operated foundries in order to assure the necessary supply of infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) to National Security Space (NSS) agencies when needed. The primary goal is to demonstrate on-shore MCT detectors are equivalent in performance to IRFPAs utilizing off-shore substrates. \n\nProjects Other (non-NSS)\/ISB:\n\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers Production Capacity: Developed under funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), the Secure Hybrid Composite Container (SHCC) is an intermodal ISO shipping container providing advanced security features, while meeting all the operational, structural, and customs requirements of standard steel 20ft and 40ft shipping containers. The security system is designed to confirm the integrity of the container and report breaches to the cognizant authorities. The container includes the capability to be tracked during its shipment and alert officials to track deviations and alarms. The ultimate goal of the container is to provide the level of security to law enforcement officials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not been inserted into the container for smuggling into the US. Investment under Title III to establish initial production capability for the secure hybrid composite container can help satisfy an estimated 3,000 container per year initial government need from the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community agencies requiring secure shipping containers. A production line with an output of approximately 100 containers per year output is planned. Project was funded using prior year funding.\n\nNext Generation Jammer Gallium Nitride (GaN) MMIC & Wideband Circulator Technologies (Prior Years and FY 2017- FY 2019): This project is an investment in production technology and capacity expansion for gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and wideband circulator technologies for Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program requirements. The objective is to establish\/expand one or more domestic sources for GaN integrated circuit components to ensure the availability of critical components required for the Next Generation Jammer and other electronic warfare systems. Additionally, this initiative will mitigate program risk by ensuring on-shore availability of critical components, maintain secure sources for these essential electronic components through oversight of sources and processes, and address process and quality improvements to drive down costs. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nStrategic Radiation Hardened Trusted Microelectronics Foundry: This project was a new start in FY 2018. This project provides an assured capability to produce or acquire strategic radiation hardened trusted microelectronics consistent with Department of Defense Instruction 5200.44 to supply necessary microelectronic components for necessary radiation environments involved with the acquisition of delivery systems for nuclear weapons. It provides production, engineering, and sustainment services in support of Strategic Radiation-Hardened microelectronics fabrication via a Defense Microelectronics Activity- accredited Trusted Supplier using a Trusted flow.\n\nNext Generation Soldier Protection: The purpose of this project is to create a manufacturing capacity to produce lightweight, high-strength, inherently fire-resistant co-polymer aramid fibers to provide lightweight force protection for Soldiers and air, ground, and naval platforms and bases. Examples include lighter and stronger body armor, helmets, pelvic protection, enhanced combat vehicle survivability, enhanced aviation platform survivability, and integrated base protection. A next generation of co-polymer aramid fibers would provide a step-change increase in tenacity over existing fibers, a key attribute for enabling lighter-weight ballistic protection. Project funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.\n\nLithium Sea-Water Batteries: This is a new start project using prior year funds. The project is to procure a pilot plant for to produce specialized Lithium Sea-Water batteries for Navy Sonobuoys utilizing the Next Generation Airborne Passive Sensor. The project includes design, testing, and validation of the batteries pilot plant line. This includes development and construction of pilot lines for circular protected lithium electrodes, catalyzed cathodes, and battery assembly to meet Navy production requirements. \n\nAlane (AlH3) Fuel:  This project will create the domestic manufacturing capability for Aluminum Hydride (AlH3) or \"Alane\" Fuel.  Alane-powered fuel cells are higher energy-density than traditional lithium ion batteries on the market and will meet the required form factors for all defense needs. Lightweight cells made with Alane reduce the burden that soldiers must carry and therefore increase mobility, operational effectiveness, and survivability of the soldiers and systems they are used in. There is currently no domestic industrial manufacturing capability for these cells and a public\/private partnership under the authorities of Title III of the Defense Production Act will spur industry to create the initial capability to meet defense needs as well as provide an impetus for domestic commercial adaptability and use of the technology.\n\nShielded Infrastructures: The purpose of this follow-on effort is to leverage the success of the original DPA Title III project for Conductive Composite Nanomaterials by integrating and scaling the technology (chemical vapor depositioned nickel coated nano-materials) into other novel applications such as non-metallic enclosures, cases, laminates, injection moldings, wallpapers, paints, windows, etc."

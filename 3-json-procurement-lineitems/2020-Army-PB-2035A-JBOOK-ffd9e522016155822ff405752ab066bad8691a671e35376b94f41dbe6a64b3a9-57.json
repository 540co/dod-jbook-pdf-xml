            "val": "Calibration Sets Equipment (CALSETS) consists of calibration instrumentation housed in fixed facilities or contained within tactical shelters with accompanying power generation equipment.  The CALSETS instrumentation provides support to maintenance units and area support organizations from brigade to multi-theater sustainment operations and ensures a cascading transfer of precision accuracy originating from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The calibration sets are designed to support 90 percent of the Army test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) workload with an objective of 98 percent.  The instruments and equipment procured through this program are assembled into several set configurations (AN\/GSM-286, AN\/GSM-287, AN\/GSM-439, AN\/GSM-440, AN\/GSM-442, AN\/GSM-26(V)1, AN\/GSM-26(V)2 and Secondary Reference) and two tactical calibration shelters (AN\/GSM-705 and AN\/GSM-421A(V)2).  These calibration standards sets are integral to verifying the accuracy of TMDE with mandated traceability to accuracy standards.  State-of-the-art calibration equipment is required to ensure that advanced technology weapons and systems are maintained at the required state of operational readiness.  Systems supported by the Calibration Sets include, but are not limited to, unmanned aerial vehicles (Shadow\/Gray Eagle); military signal and electronic intelligence operations; tactical and strategic communications (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)); and ground, missile and aviation platforms such as the Army Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), Abrams, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Patriot, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook and all future weapon systems.\n\nThe quantities for FY 2018 and FY 2019 include modernization items that are incorporated into calibration set shelters in the Army's inventory to maintain and upgrade capabilities of the sets. Quantities shown for FY 2020 and the out-years represent calibration set\/shelter acquisitions only and exclude quantities for modernization items.  \n\nArmy Acquisition Objective (AAO):  AN\/GSM-286 - 45; AN\/GSM-287 - 67; AN\/GSM-439 - 37; AN\/GSM-440 - 32; AN\/GSM-705 - 26; AN\/GSM-421A(V)2 - 26; AN\/GSM-26(V)1 - 161; AN\/GSM-26(V)2 - 37; AN\/GSM-422 - 1; Secondary Reference Standards Set - 11"

            "val": "FY 2020 base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.030 million support acquisition of low phase noise signal generators, multi-function electrical calibrators (to support various electronic test, measurement and diagnostic equipment used on aviation, communication, missile and radar systems), pneumatic pressure indicators (to support Army pitot-static test equipment (i.e., Army aviation altitude and airspeed testers)), and instrument controllers (used to display all Army calibration procedures and to automate the execution of most Army calibration procedures).  These items are components of various calibration sets and used in tactical calibration shelters.\n \nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

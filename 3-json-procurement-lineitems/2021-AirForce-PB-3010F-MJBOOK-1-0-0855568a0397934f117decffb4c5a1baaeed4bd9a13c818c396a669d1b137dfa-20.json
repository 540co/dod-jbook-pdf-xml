Among gliders there are two TG-15A aircraft with a design service life of 6,000 hours, three TG-15B aircraft with a design service life of 6,000 hours, and 18 TG-16A aircraft with a design service life of 12,000 hours.  Powered flight consists of four T-41D aircraft with a design service life of 60,000 hours, three T-51A aircraft with a design service life of 60,000 hours and 24 T-53A aircraft with a design service life of 12,000 hours.  To support parachute jumping there are three UV-18B aircraft with a design service life of 40,000 hours.  The primary effort in FY21 is Low Cost Modifications, which includes UV-18B avionics modification, TG-15A\/B avionics modification, various AF Academy simulator system procurements, FAA Service Bulletins, Air Worthiness Directives, Program Management and Administration, studies, and civilian pay and CMEs in support of program activities.  \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0804748F."

            "val": "Beginning in FY 2017, effort continues in OPN Line Item 2830, Afloat ATC Equipment\n\nDESCRIPTION:  Shipboard Air Traffic Control (SATC) systems are responsible for safe and expeditious control of air traffic within 50 Nautical Miles of a ship.  SATC systems include the air traffic surveillance radar, AN\/SPN-43, and the air traffic central tracking and control system, AN\/TPX-42, which has two major configurations: Carrier Air Traffic Control Center-Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (CATCC-DAIR) and Amphibious Air Traffic Control Center-Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (AATCC-DAIR).  Both DAIR systems use AN\/SPN-43 and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) inputs to track and control aircraft.  Obsolescence problems are being addressed through various upgrades in a phased approach.  The major upgrades include a series of AN\/TPX-42 modification kits requiring various combinations of AN\/UYK-44 processor rehost, track processor upgrade, AN\/UYQ-70 console, audio recorder, flat panel display, and other components to bring the predecessor system to AN\/TPX-42A(V)14 with field changes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 configuration and eventually to the Air Traffic Control Multifunction Console configuration.  The AN\/SPN-43 radar system is required for the service-life of CVN68-CVN77 & LHA\/LHD class ships with no replacement system identified.\n\nInstalling Agent:  Shipyards and Alteration Installation Teams.\nWhen installation to be made:  Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) \/ Restricted Availability (RAV).\nShips or facilities to receive the equipment:  CVNs, LHD\/LHAs, Software Support Activity (NAWCAD, St Inigoes, MD), Integrated Combat System Test Facility (San Diego, CA), Landing Systems Test Facility (NAWCAD, Patuxent River, MD), and training sites."

            "val": "The Navy Ashore Pollution Control Equipment program funds hazardous substance spill containment and recovery systems.\n\nFunding requirements for the Navy's oil spill program include procurement of oil spill containment booms and related deployment equipment. After initial containment with boom, shore activities can efficiently collect spilled oil with vacuum trucks.  This equipment will enable the Navy to meet the requirements established by the EPA in the National Contingency Plan which requires rapid and effective response to oil spills. The revised National Spill Contingency Plan mandates that the DOD and the Navy assume responsibility for their own oil and hazardous substance spills. These broad responsibilities require the Navy to maintain sufficient spill response equipment for the Navy activities worldwide, such as oil spill containment systems and recovery systems. The severe oil spills in Alaska, California and the Gulf of Mexico have increased the public's sensitivity to releases of oil into the environment."

Without additional procurement, there is increased maintenance costs to extend equipment service life and readiness is impacted during increased maintenance cycle times.\n\nFY 2017 decrease in Pollution Control Equipment OPN by $0.098M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015."

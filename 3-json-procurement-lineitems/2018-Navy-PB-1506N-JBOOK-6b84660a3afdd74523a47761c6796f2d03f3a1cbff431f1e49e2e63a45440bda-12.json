            "val": "The C-2A(R) Greyhound is a high wing monoplane, twin engine turbo-prop aircraft capable of operating from both a shore base and all operational United States Navy aircraft carrier classes.  The mission of the C-2A(R) is to provide rapid response Carrier Onboard Delivery of fleet essential supplies, repair parts, and personnel to sustain at sea operations of deployed battle groups.  In addition, the C-2A(R) provides airdrop delivery and mobilization support for special operations forces from land bases and carriers.  The design service life of the C-2A(R) was 10,000 flight hours with 15,000 landings. Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) modifications increased the service life to 15,000 flight hours and 36,000 landings and install various upgrades to allow C-2A(R) to meet requirements into the next decade.  The goal of the Critical Components Operational Safety Improvement Program (11-07) is to continue procurement efforts for the multiple modifications. Critical Components are composed of Communication Avionics and Radio Upgrades, Engine Power & Propulsion, Ejector valve, and Transducer Engineering Change Proposals.  The C-2 Critical Brake Upgrade Operational Safety Improvement Program (04-16) provides funding for air vehicle modifications to improve operational ground controllability of C-2A aircraft.  The Structural Enhancement Operational Safety Improvement Program (14-17) is to target improvement to structural integrity.  These improvements are a vital requirement for C-2 to maintain the aircraft in the Fleet.  The modification to the wing center section is to prevent structural cracks due to fatigue.  There is a total number of 35 C-2A aircraft.\n\nFunding was added to the \"Cost To Complete\" amounts.  Funding is required to complete the Critical Brake Upgrade (OSIP 04-16) and the Structural Enhancement (OSIP 14-17) programs."

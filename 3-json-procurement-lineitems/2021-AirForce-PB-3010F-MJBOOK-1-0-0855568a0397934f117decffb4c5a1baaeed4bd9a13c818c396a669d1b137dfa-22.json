            "val": "The T-1A is a missionized Beech 400A used in the Airlift\/Tanker track of the USAF Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and in Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training for Air Education and Training Command (AETC). It is powered by two Pratt and Whitney JT15D-5 turbofan engines mounted on the aft fuselage producing 2,900 pounds of thrust each. Avionics include Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radios, Inertial Navigation System (INS), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Airborne Direction Finder (ADF), and two Very High Frequency Omni Range\/Instrument Landing System (VOR\/ILS). Aircraft modified for CSO training include a Global Positioning System (GPS)-driven synthetic radar and simulated Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) in the right seat flight deck position to be utilized by the student CSO. A second student station and a second instructor station have also been added in the rear of the aircraft. The primary effort in FY2021 is the Avionics Modification. Funding contained in this platform's documentation directly aids Air Education and Training Command (AETC) flying training enterprise.\n\nThis line item funds avionics modifications to the T-1A aircraft and simulators. This effort will install the 55 previously acquired modification kits in to T-1A trainer aircraft, 16 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT's) and 14 Part Task Trainers (PTT's). All 21 CSO training-configured aircraft will receive the modification as well as 34 SUPT aircraft. The remaining 122 T-1A aircraft will not be modified due to the planned divestiture of the aircraft.\n\nFunding request reduced from FY20 budget for planned divestment of T-1A airlift\/tanker Undergraduate Pilot Training fleet (156 aircraft) beginning in FY23.  USAF plans to maintain 21 CSO training-configured T-1A aircraft.\n\nDivest T-1 Undergraduate Pilot Training Fleet saved $31.2M in BY.  Divest T-1 Undergraduate Pilot Training Fleet description: Pilot Training Next (PTN) offers a more effective approach to pilot training.  New training technologies allow for the retirement of the T-1 as a training platform this divestment contributes to making PTN available to the enterprise creating an opportunity to increase pilot production.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Funding for this exhibit contained in PE 0804741F."

The FY19 OCO approved UFR will be used to purchase (10) targeting pods, the pods have a 14 month lead time. The OCO funding will allow B-1 to meet the scheduled Required Asset Availability (RAA) date for mission effectiveness.\n\nThe legacy munitions handling units (MHU) program consists of the MHU-196\/M and MHU-204\/M. The MHUs will be overhauled and given a new designation: MHU-196A\/M and MHU-204A\/M units. This effort will provide an additional 20 years of service life by assessing the structural integrity and repairing the legacy control and power system. Program also alleviates part obsolescence and addresses diminishing manufacturing sources. Funding support the activation of the depot, OO-ALC, to expand their facility production and investing in additional space, support equipment and manpower. Total non-recurring cost are for the depot activation: facilities, support equipment, and other support as required. During depot activation, PMA funding may be used for contract services in support of the program office, program office operations and program travel requirements. Group A kits are not required; all components parts are\/will be stock listed, either by the Program Management Office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and\/or the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). Assets are used in support of nuclear and conventional operations. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requested a production time line of 8 years. In order to meet this, additional funding is required for depot activation. Prior year funding was identified in APPN 3010, BP12, 0202834F Aircraft Replacement Support Equip and moved to APPN 3010, BP12, CLC Other Production Charges to reflect the direction to use organic depot overhaul."

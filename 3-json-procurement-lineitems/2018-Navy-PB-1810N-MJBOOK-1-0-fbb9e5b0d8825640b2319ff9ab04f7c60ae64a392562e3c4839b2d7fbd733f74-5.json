This exhibit reflects FY15-16 and the data continues on under BLI 2150 for FY17-21.\n\nThis program procures hydrophones, transducers, cables, associated Out-Board Electronics bottles (OBE), and acoustic windows for In-Service Undersea Warfare Sonars on all classes of submarines.  The components are required to support units in the fleet on a replacement basis, at regularly scheduled ship overhauls, and at interim availabilities when units are defective, and for upgrades.\n\n[P40A \/ PU100 SONAR SWITCHES AND TRANSDUCERS]: Included in this line are procurements of transducers, hydrophones, windows, cables, Out-Board Electronics (OBE), domes and their associated mounting hardware, and other support equipment and materials for the following Undersea Warfare Sonars:  BSY-1, BSY-2, BQQ-5, BQQ-6, BQQ-10, BQG-5, BQS-15, BQS-14A, WQC-2, WLR-9\/12, BQN-13, BQN-17, BQA-8, BQH-1 and BQS-25.\n\n[P40A \/ PU200 ENGINEERING CHANGES]: Funds ECPs, Value Engineering awards, and hardware changes affecting the SSN 688, 688I, SEAWOLF, SSBN 726 (TRIDENT), SSGN\/SSBN, and VA Class submarines.\n\n[P40A \/ PU300 PROGRAM SUPPORT]: Supports the procurement of equipment of sonar hydrophones, transducers, cables, Out-Board Electronics (OBEs), and acoustic windows for In-Service Undersea Warfare Sonars."

            "val": "Special Equipment for User Testing is comprised of multiple programs for the Major Operational Testing Instrumentation and Army Threat Simulator Program.  Program provides funding for Major Operational Testing Instrumentation, Major Field Instrumentation for Operational Testing (OT), Force Development Testing and Experimentation (FDTE), and Army Warfighting Experiments (AWE).  Initiatives are tied to tactical and instrumentation systems that support each of the five joint functional concepts outlined in the Army Modernization Plan (Force Application; Protection; Focused Logistics; Battlespace Awareness; Command and Control).  The Army Threat Simulator Program procures actual foreign hardware and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) (e.g., chassis, subsystems, commercial equipment, or actual threat weapons), which are integrated into a threat simulator design for user testing and training.  Budget Item procures a variety of Special Equipment for User Testing, such as Integrated Threat Force, Threat Signal Injection Jammer (TSIJ), Threat Operations and Advanced Jammer Suite.\n\nSpecial Equipment for User Testing programs provides support at: Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) and Operational Test Command (OTC) facilities include Transformation Technology Directorate (TTD) at Fort Hood, TX; Fire Support Test Directorate (FSTD) at Fort Sill, OK; Airborne Special Operations Test Directorate (ABSOTD) at Fort Bragg, NC; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate (ADATD) and Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); Redstone Test Center (RTC); White Sands Test Center (WSTC); and Yuma Test Center (YTC)."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.319 million procures multiple threat systems (Electronic Warfare (EW), Command, Control, and Communications, and Advanced Jamming) required to support developmental and operational testing and training of network centric threat scenarios. These threat scenarios are critical to integrating digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools that support the establishment of robust command and control capabilities. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from this new dimension of digital command and control battlefield warfare capabilities. The Army will field 10 Advanced Jammer capabilities to fulfill developmental and operational test requirements for ongoing Army Warfighter Assessments and Network Integration Evaluation events.  Validated threat jammers are a critical element to maintaining threat EW density and realism required by Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to provide operationally relevant environments for Test and Evaluation (T&E) and training.  Fielded threat capabilities are operated, maintained, and sustained as one integrated threat electronic warfare force in support of Army T&E activities, such as the Network Integration Evaluation."

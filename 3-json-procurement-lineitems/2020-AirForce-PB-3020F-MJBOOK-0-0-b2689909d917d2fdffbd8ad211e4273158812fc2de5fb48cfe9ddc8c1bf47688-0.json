            "val": "In the FY2019 budget, BP22 Missile Replacement Equipment- Ballistic received an FY18 Congressional rescission of $5.200M.  The correct total for FY18 is $89.544M.\n\nThe FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $18.700 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis program funds replacement of organizational and intermediate level support equipment for all out-of-production ballistic missile systems. Equipment procured is used for missile weapon systems maintenance and testing at organizational\/intermediate (base\/field) launch control facilities, as well as missile testing facilities.  Equipment and qualified minor construction costs related to depot activation. Programs will include analysis of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) risks and procurement activities related to DMSMS. \n\nRelated Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Air Force funding is contained in PE 0101213F.\n\n\u2022 Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER):  The Missile Guidance Set (MGS) repair is dependent on the proper functioning of the PIGA build equipment. The PIGA BER program replaces and updates obsolete systems. PIGA BER procurement activities will modify or replace one Digital Pickoff Alignment station, one Electrical Alignment station, one Alignment Test station, one Torque Test station, and one Fluid Fill station.  Additionally funds may be used for any parts\/re-work\/technical data necessary for the retrofit of assets produced during RDT&E for operational capability after testing. PIGA BER is an FY20 Procurement New Start. \n\n\u2022 G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER):  G6B4 BER program replaces three stations used for repair, test, and calibration of gyroscopes. EMD funds were used to replace G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station, G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station, and the Gyro F-coefficient Station.  Procurement funding is for the purchase of 1 Rotor Balance Test Station and any parts\/retrofitting\/technical-data updates needed for full operational capability of 3 RDT&E assets. G6B4 BER is an FY20 Production New Start.\n\n\u2022 Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million:  Support Equipment Less Than $5M procures low cost new, modified or replacement support equipment, to include facilities and other equipment to support programmed depot maintenance capability activation.\n\n\u2022 MM Power Panels (PPM):  Minuteman Power Panels replaces obsolete and unsupportable power distribution panels within Launch Control Centers and Launch Facilities.\n\n\u2022 Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR):  Provides nuclear certified tractor and trailer to emplace, extract and transport the reentry system, Propulsion System Rocket Engine, and guidance systems. Replaces current payload transporter to meet USSTRATCOM security requirements and addresses supportability issues. Required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in 2036.\n\n\u2022 Performance Assessment Data System Communication Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II):  Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) is used to collect and analyze Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) data, Launch Facility (LF) faults and anomalies, as well as LF security and Environmental Control System (ECS) data. PADS is a critical MM III legacy data system, developed in the late 1970s and redesigned in 1996-1999, using commercial software. This program addresses PADS reliability, by updating software to meet Air Force software security requirements and to conform to the Air Force standard desktop configuration.\n\n\u2022 Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE):  RFSE replaces the current reentry system test set. RFSE will increase the Mean Time Between Failure, eliminate unneeded Mk12 functions, and add new Mk21 functions. It will provide capability to meet Department of Energy mandated Limited Life Component warhead swaps and to test electrical continuity during buildup of Minuteman III reentry systems.\n\n\u2022 Squadron Data Simulator (SDS):  The SDS simulates the command and control message traffic between a MM squadron of Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and the Launch Facilities (LFs). The SDS acquisition program was cancelled after a new supportability study and cost analysis revealed the current system is sustainable. \n\n\u2022 Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP):  The Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces the current transporter erector used to emplace, extract and transport MM III boosters to and from launch facilities. TERP will update existing drawings, specifications and technical orders to eliminate parts obsolescence and address the required usage through 2036.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

            "val": "FY20 funding provides replacement support equipment items for an aging inventory of equipment which has become increasingly more costly to maintain. These items will increase ballistic missile system reliability and maintainability by providing state-of-the-art maintenance repair and testing capability. The items are required to bridge the gap to the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy directed nuclear force modernization activities. Requirements are jointly determined by Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) and are based on established allowance standards.\n\nItems requested in FY20 are displayed on the attached P-40A. Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current and emerging Air Force mission requirements.\n\n\u2022 Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER): PIGA BER program replaces unsustainable equipment due to obsolescence issues affecting the ability to test and build the PIGA.\n\n\u2022 G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER): Required to sustain Minuteman III weapon system experiencing obsolete parts associated with each station.\n\n\u2022 Ballistic Missile Items Less Than $5 Million: Procures low cost support equipment required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).\n\n\u2022 MM Power Panels (PPM): Procures power panel replacements required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).\n\n\u2022 Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR): Replaces current payload transporter to meet USSTRATCOM security requirements and addresses supportability issues. Required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Issues during testing delayed Milestone C from 2QFY18 to 1QFY19. A path forward was agreed upon from anomalous developmental testing and the technical solutions from operational test issues were verified and demonstrated in Jul 2018. Operational testing continued in 1QFY19. The production contract will be awarded in 2QFY19 for the first production article. Low rate initial production will start in FY20 with the procurement of 2 units.  \n\n\u2022 Perf Assess Data Sys Comm Equip Interface Unit (PADS CEIU II): No FY20 funding requested.\n\n\u2022 Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE): The RFSE replaces unsupportable and unreliable support equipment and is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD).\n\n\u2022 Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP): Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP) replaces current transporter erectors exhibiting structural integrity issues and addresses supportability issues. TERP is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Engineering and Manufacturing Development completion delayed due to anomalies during developmental testing. Root cause analysis identified corrective action and developmental testing completion anticipated 2QFY19. Operational testing will complete 2QFY19 leading to milestone C and the order of the first 4 units in 3QFY19 using FY18 funding. The second and third lots of 5 units are planned for FY20. The fourth lot of 5 units is planned for FY21."

                        "val": "Description: The Reentry System Field Support Equipment (RFSE) program is producing test sets to replace the aging and obsolete Reentry System Test Set (RSTS) and the Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV) Field Test Set (SFTS).  The RSTS was built in the late 1960s, using early 1960s technology.  The RSTS was designed to have a Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) of approximately 3000 hours but has degraded to about 24 hours at RFSE program initiation.  The replacement effort will consist of procuring Reentry System Test Consoles (RSTC), Forward Section Test Sets (FSTS), and sets of support equipment consisting of a RSTC Alignment Console and two FSTS calibration boxes per set.  This procurement action will be done to fulfill the requirements of AFGSC. \n\nThe test sets will be used to test and functionally check out the Mk12A and Mk21 Reentry Systems and the Mk12A Reentry Vehicle's Forward Sections.  The test sets support the Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) weapon system ensuring its viability to 2030 and beyond. The RSTC will be able to check-out all possible SERV Reentry System configurations.  The Mk12A Forward Section will be checked-out by the FSTS, allowing simultaneous processing efforts to take place, reducing overall processing time in the Weapon Storage Area.  The Mk21 Forward Sections will continue to be checked by the current SERV Arming and Fuzing Assembly Test Set.\n\nJustification: The RFSE replaces unsupportable and unreliable support equipment and is required to sustain Minuteman III operations through fielding of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) in 2036.\n\nProgram previously executed equipment buy using FY16 funds.  FY18-20 funding supports Interim Contract Support and PMA until program reaches IOC in FY20."

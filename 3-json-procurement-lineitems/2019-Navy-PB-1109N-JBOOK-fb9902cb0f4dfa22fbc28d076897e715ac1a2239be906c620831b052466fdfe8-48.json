Funds also provide for direct vendor support of the PEI delivery to the Fleet Marine Force.  \n\nThis account has funding for the following programs:\nSecure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical-Terminal (SMART-T), Tactical Remote Sensor System (TRSS), MAGTF Secondary Imagery Dissemination System (MSIDS), Intelligence Analysis System (IAS), Terrestrial Collection, LAV-Anti Tank System Program, LAV Obsolescence Program, M1A1 Modification, Family of Material Handling Equipment (FMHE), Ground\/Air Task Oriented Radar (G\/ATOR AN\/TPS-80), RQ-21A Small Tactical UAS, General Purpose Tool and Test Systems (GPTTS), Amphibious Combat Vehicle Increment 1.1 (ACV 1.1), and Training Simulation Support (TSS)\/Training Devices."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base Appropriation Request: $35.640M ($35.278M Active; $0.362M Reserve)\n\nThe funding increase ($15.123M) from FY17 to FY18 is primarily due to G\/ATOR increase of $5.647, RQ-21 increase of $5.215M and ACV 1.1 increase of $5.569M.\n\nLAV Anti-Tank Modernization (ATM) BLI 2038: $1.006M funding will continue to provide funding for spares required for the fielding of the ATM. \n\nAN\/TPS-80 Ground Air Task Oriented Radar (G\/ATOR) BLI 4655: $16.840M provides spares funding to support Gallium Nitride (GaN) LRIP systems. FY18 Spares funding is required to procure the initial provisioning package to primarily support those GaN LRIP systems being procured in FY17 and fielded in FY19, as over 90 percent of the G\/ATOR Spares have a lead time exceeding 12 months. The Spares funding increase of ($5.647M) from FY17 to FY18 ultimately supports the additional fielding of four (4) new systems in FY19 for a total of ten (10) G\/ATOR systems fielded through FY19. Additionally, this funding increase allows for the decentralized distribution of initial spares from LOGCOM to the Repair Inventory Points at each Marine Expeditionary Force. Without adequate sparing, Marine Operational Forces will not have the necessary repair parts to operate and maintain newly fielded G\/ATOR Radar Systems placing the program at significant risk of meeting its important Key Performance Parameter (KPP) 8; Sustainment.\n\nFamily of Material Handling Equipment (FMHE) BLI 6544: $0.052M provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps MHE such as forklifts, cranes, and container handlers.  This budget line item also includes funding for equipment such as the Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF), Hydraulic Excavator (HYEX), Extendable Boom Forklift Modernization (EBFL-M), Rough Terrain Container Handler (RTCH) SLEP and the Tractor, Rubber Tires, and Articulated Steering, Multiple Purpose (TRAM) SLEP.\n\nGeneral Purpose Tool and Test Equipment BLI 4181: $0.173M funding will continue to support reimbursement to the working capital funds for spares acquired and needed during test support.\n\nTraining Simulation Support (TSS)\/Training Devices BLI 6532: $0.050M Training Simulation Support will continue to provide funding for a small quantity of systems spares\/parts to fulfill allowance pool quantities while systems are being repaired or replaced.\n\nIAS BLI 4747: $0.158M of spares funding will provide for direct vendor support of the principal end item (PEI) components delivery to the Fleet Marine Force.\n\nMSIDS BLI 4747: $0.099M will provide for purchase of hardware and accessory spares of the MSIDS Suite necessary to keep ground-based imagery collection and dissemination assets in operation, ensuring spares are available to the warfighter when breakage occurs to minimize equipment down-time.\n\nTRSS BLI 4747: $0.099M will provide for the purchase of equipment spares in the TRSS System of Systems (SoS) to ensure repair time and equipment unavailability is minimized for the warfighter.\n\nSMART-T BLI 4633: $0.205M will provide for the direct vendor support of the principal end item (PEI) components to reduce repair time and equipment downtime for the Warfighter.\n\nRQ-21 UAS BLI 4737: $11.027M procures initial spares for 4 RQ-21A systems in FY18 as well as support sparing for deployments in that year.  Increase of $5.215M from FY17 to FY18 is due to requirement for the spares to support Marine deployments with RQ-21 that year.\n\nM1A1 Modification Kits BLI 2061: Reserve $0.362M will procure the remaining reserve spares for the Abrams Integrated Display and Targeting System (AIDATS).  The $4.018M decrease in funding from FY17 is due to the procurement strategy that maximized production of AIDATS in FY17.\n\nACV 1.1 BLI 2025:  $5.569M procures initial spares for communication suites, Driver's Vision Enhancer, Exportable Power, Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), and Amphibious Remote Weapon Stations (ARWS).  Initial spares for ACV 1.1 are procured commensurate with the end items they support based on lead time for procurement.\n\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $25.804M \n\nThe funding decrease of $9.836M from FY18 to FY19 is primarily due to G\/ATOR decrease of $3.822M and RQ-21 decrease of $11.027M.\n\nLAV Obsolescence(OB) BLI 2038: $5.735M funding will provide spares funding for direct vendor support required for the fielding of the OB kits on the Light Armored Vehicle.\n\nAN\/TPS-80 Ground Air Task Oriented Radar (G\/ATOR) BLI 4655: $13.018M provides spares funding to support Gallium Nitride (GaN) LRIP systems procured in FY18. FY19 Spares funding is required to procure the initial provisioning package to primarily support those GaN LRIP systems being procured in FY18 and fielded in FY20, as over 90 percent of the G\/ATOR Spares have a lead time exceeding 12 months. The Spares funding decreases ($3.822M) from FY18 to FY19 supports the fielding of three (3) new systems in FY20 for a total of thirteen (13) G\/ATOR systems fielded through FY20. The additional funding in FY18 supported the decentralized distribution of initial spares from LOGCOM to the Repair Inventory Points at each Marine Expeditionary Force. Without adequate sparing, Marine Operational Forces will not have the necessary repair parts to operate and maintain newly fielded G\/ATOR Radar Systems placing the program at significant risk of meeting its important Key Performance Parameter (KPP) 8; Sustainment.\n\nFamily of Material Handling Equipment (FMHE) BLI 6544: $0.053M provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps MHE such as forklifts, cranes, and container handlers.  This budget line item also includes funding for equipment such as the Light Capability Rough Terrain Forklift (LCRTF), Hydraulic Excavator (HYEX), Extendable Boom Forklift Modernization (EBFL-M), Rough Terrain Container Handler (RTCH) SLEP and the Tractor, Rubber Tires, and Articulated Steering, Multiple Purpose (TRAM) SLEP.\n\nGeneral Purpose Tool and Test Equipment BLI 4181: $0.174M funding will continue to support reimbursement to the working capital funds for spares acquired and needed during test support.\n\nTraining Simulation Support (TSS)\/Training Devices BLI 6532: $0.051M Training Simulation Support will continue to provide funding for a small quantity of systems spares\/parts to fulfill allowance pool quantities while systems are being repaired or replaced.\n\nSMART-T BLI 4633: $0.207M will provide for the direct vendor support of the principal end item (PEI) components to reduce repair time and equipment downtime for the Warfighter.\n\nIAS BLI 4747: $0.160M of spares funding will provide for direct vendor support of the principal end item (PEI) components delivery to the Fleet Marine Force.\n\nTerrestrial Collection BLI 4747: $0.261M will provide for purchase of equipment spares necessary to keep ground-based imagery collection and dissemination assets and sensor systems in operation, ensuring spares are available to the warfighter when breakage occurs to minimize equipment down-time.\n\nACV 1.1 BLI 2025:  $6.145M will provide for initial spares for communication suites, Driver's Vision Enhancer, Exportable Power, Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P), and Amphibious Remote Weapon Stations (ARWS).  Initial spares for ACV 1.1 are procured commensurate with the end items they support based on lead time for procurement."

Beginning in FY18 this funding line represents a consolidation of ammunition line items by functional capability.\n\nThis line includes demolition items, grenades, pyrotechnical devices, mines, and non-lethal weapons.  \n\nDemolition items provide high explosives for the purpose of destroying or altering man-made or natural objects or obstacles.  Demolition munitions charges include block charges, shaped charges, flexible-linear charges, explosive sheet, cable, canine explosive scent items, chain cutters and military dynamite. They are used for general demolition, cutting, breaching, cratering, and destruction of abandoned equipment and ammunition.  \n\nAlso included are all grenades, pyrotechnics and mines used by the ground element of the Marine Corps.  This includes colored smoke grenades, various pyrotechnics used in training to simulate battlefield affects, and the claymore mine and claymore mine trainers. \n\nThis family also includes non-lethal munition variants such as; 12 gauge, 40mm grenades, diversionary grenades, 81mm non-lethal mortars and the Mission Payload Module (MPMN) system.  These munitions are intended to incapacitate, warn or drive off targeted personnel or materiel; while minimizing permanent injury to personnel, and damage to property in the target area or environment.\n\nThe funds prior to FY18 are contained in BLI's 1030, 1468, 1500 and 1628."

ESIP costs support engineering functions on produced units which includes quality assurance, configuration management, lot testing support, and production support for items currently in production.  Additionally, this funding addresses any changes to the design during production, assuring that the ammunition is of the highest quality, and deals with any manufacturing and producibility concerns during these processes."

        "Description": {
            "val": "The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997), and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term \"bandwidth gap\" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.\n\nWGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3.  These satellites were successfully launched on 10 October 2007, 3 April 2009, and 5 December 2009, respectively.   \n\nWGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites are designed with slight modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  WGS-4 was successfully launched on 19 January 2012.  WGS-5 was successfully launched on 24 May 2013.\n\nA United States-Australia WGS partnership was codified in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 14 November 2007.  Australia provides funds needed to buy satellite 6 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (satellites 1-6) resources.  WGS-6 was successfully launched on 7 August 2013.  WGS-6 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.\n\nWGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) consists of satellites 7-10. The WGS procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for the WGS B2FO satellites.   \n\nA multilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand was codified in an MOU in January 2012.  Norway and the Czech Republic joined the multilateral partnership in mid-2017.  The United States' contributions include existing and programmed infrastructure, to include the acquisition, launch, operations, and sustainment costs of WGS 1-8, and the launch, operations, and sustainment of WGS-9.  Other Partners' contributions fund WGS-9 acquisition and support activities.  Each Partner provides funds needed to buy WGS-9 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (satellites 1-9) resources commensurate with its level of contribution.  WGS-9 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.\n\nWGS-7 was successfully launched on 23 July 2015. WGS-8 was successfully launched on 7 December 2016. WGS-9 was successfully launched on 18 March 2017. WGS-10 will be launched in FY 2019.\n\nDiscussions for potential future partnerships regarding the WGS program continue in support of National Space Policy and improved operational efficiency.\n\nIn the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Congress added $600.0M SPAF in FY 2018 for \"full funding for WGS 11 and 12.\"  A sole source Request for Proposal for WGS 11 & 12 was released to Boeing in June 2018.  \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nThe flyaway unit cost is not included on P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.\n\nAs of the FY 2016 PB submission, space programs' satellite procurement funding has been re-categorized from Appropriation 3020, Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF), to Appropriation 3021, SPAF, in FY 2016 and beyond.  Total MPAF\/SPAF procurement funding is $3,769.324M.  Total WGS SV1-SV5 MPAF funds are $1,619.426M.  There are no WGS SV1-SV5 SPAF funds.  Total WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) MPAF\/SPAF funds are $2,149.898M. The total WGS B2FO procurement funding includes the FY 2018 $600M congressional add for WGS 11-12.\n    \nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203600F.    \n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 1206433F.\n\nIn the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 2019, Congress cancelled Pathfinder #5 by realigning $49.5M of FY 2019 SPAF funds to a new RDT&E program element (PE 1206445F) for Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM). Additionally, in the same Act, Congress rescinded $41.0M of FY 2018 SPAF funds to cancel COMSATCOM Pathfinder #4.  The correct total for FY 2018 is $634.259M.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

        "Description": {
            "val": "Long Range Radar (AN\/TPS-59) - The AN\/TPS-59A(V)3 is a transportable, three dimensional, tactical radar system that provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with long-range surveillance.  It is the MAGTF's only ground based long range sensor that provides the capability to detect and report Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and track Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM).  The AN\/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar System is connected to the AN\/TSQ-269 Mobile - TAOM (M-TAOM) or the Common Aviation Command and Control Systems (CAC2S).  It provides the air defense controllers data and may be used autonomously to conduct Ground Control Intercept, tactical en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC), or TBM alert operations via the Joint Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) encrypted Link-16.  The USMC extended the AN\/TPS-59 service life through 2035; therefore, in order to maintain its operational relevance on the battlefield, a number of modernization efforts will be needed. This radar has been continuously deployed in support of Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) and contingencies.\n\nFamily of Target Acquisition Systems (FTAS) - The FTAS provides the MAGTF the capability to locate, identify, and attack enemy indirect fire weapons systems and observe and direct friendly artillery fire. The FTAS consists of the AN\/TPQ-46 Firefinder Radar, the AN\/TPQ-49 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar, and the AN\/TSQ-267 Target Processing Set.  The FTAS is critical in the execution of counterfire and the integration of target acquisition information enabling attack by MAGTF assets.  The FTAS also provides artillery firing units the ability to conduct artillery registration and other friendly fire missions.  The FTAS encompasses the equipment required to support target acquisition within the target acquisition platoon and is resident in the headquarters battery of each artillery regiment.  The program will continue to address system issues that arise due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) items within the FTAS.  The USMC assumed the role of Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA) for the AN\/TPQ-49 in FY15 when the Army divested itself from the system.\n\nShort\/Medium Range Air Defense Radar (SHORAD or AN\/TPS-63) - The AN\/TPS-63 is a two-dimensional, medium-range, medium altitude, transportable, mobile radar system which is employed as a tactical gap-filler or as an early warning system for deployment into the operational area. It has a 360-degree air surveillance capability at a range of 160 miles and complements the co-employed AN\/TPS-59 three dimensional, long-range, air surveillance radar system. The AN\/TPS-63 is employed by the Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) as its Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) in support of air surveillance and air control mission objectives.  Fielded in 1980, this system supported OFS and is addressing numerous DMS and obsolescence issues until replacement by Ground\/Air Task Oriented Radar (G\/ATOR AN\/TPS-80)."

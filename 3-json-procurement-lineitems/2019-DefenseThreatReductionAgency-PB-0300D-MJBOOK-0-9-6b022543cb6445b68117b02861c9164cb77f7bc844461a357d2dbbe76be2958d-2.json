This effort supports the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and is part of the transfer of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund (JITDF, 2093) to regular defense-wide appropriations (0100, 0400, and 0300) per the Chairman's recommendation to the Senate Appropriations Committee for the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, 2018.\n\nThe countering improvised threats mission under the authority, direction, and control of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), enables the DoD to counter improvised explosive devices and emerging threats in support of Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and deployed Warfighters.\n\nThe overall mission is accomplished by:\n\n     -  Sustaining an advanced information technology and fusion infrastructure that enables a threat awareness and understanding capability;\n     -  Providing expeditionary, forward-deployed operations, intelligence, training, and advisory capabilities with reach-back support;\n     -  Enabling rapid and innovative counter-improvised-threat solution development and delivery;\n     -  Supporting Military Departments\/Services' pre-deployment training and CCDRs' priority training-exercise support requirements as requested and validated; and\n     -  Leveraging broad Communities of Action that include DoD, other U.S. Government departments and agencies, key coalition allies and partners, academia, and the private sector to leverage their capabilities, expertise, access, and authorities to counter threat-networks and their use and facilitation of improvised weapons."

These resources support the Department of Defense's (DoD) goal to rapidly close the gap between the enemy's innovation cycles and the preparedness and operational capabilities of deploying and deployed U.S. Joint Forces by procuring mission critical support items rapidly."

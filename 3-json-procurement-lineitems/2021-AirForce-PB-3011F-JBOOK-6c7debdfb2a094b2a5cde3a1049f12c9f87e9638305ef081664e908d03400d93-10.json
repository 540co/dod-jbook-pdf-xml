Permanent modifications consist of configuration changes to in-service systems and equipment which correct material or other deficiencies and can be used to add or remove capability. Safety modifications correct deficiencies which may create personnel, system, or equipment hazards. \n\nThe Air Force procures munitions to maintain appropriate quantities in the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) munitions and test and training stockpiles. Active, Guard and Reserve components draw from the WRM stockpiles as required and receive test and training allocations annually based on current-year requirements.\n\nFunds may be used to address production Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages\/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier\/parts replacement, to include electronic components used commercially and in short supply, and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0208030F."

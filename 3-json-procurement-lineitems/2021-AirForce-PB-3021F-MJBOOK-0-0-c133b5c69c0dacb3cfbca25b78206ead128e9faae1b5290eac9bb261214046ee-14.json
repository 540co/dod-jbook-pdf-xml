        "Description": {
            "val": "In FY2021, MSSBIR\/SBIR High (Space) efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nNote: The flyaway unit cost is not included on the P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.\n\nThe Space Based Infrared System's (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated, centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements, Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host.\n\nSBIRS 3-6 SATELLITES:\n\nSBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funded). The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements. In Dec 2008, the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract. In order to minimize the number of storage actions and costs associated with aligning the SBIRS launches to the earliest assigned Initial Launch Capability (ILC) date of Apr 2016, the GEO-3 satellite completed production and was placed into storage in Jul 2015. The GEO-4 satellite launched as the third flight (GEO-4 Flight-3) in Jan 2017. The GEO-3 (Flight-4) satellite launched in Jan 2018. GEO-3 and 4 are fully mission capable, having completed AFSPC and USSTRATCOM operational acceptance and are certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and technical intelligence operations.\n\nSBIRS GEO-5 and 6 satellites are derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites and will be replacements for GEO-1 and 2. A four phased contract approach awarded non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds in Sep 2012, followed by award of long lead items in Feb 2013, full production in Jun 2014, and technical refresh in Jun 2015. The GEO-5 and 6 technical refresh contract modification modernizes the existing spacecraft bus design to improve commonality across Air Force and Government satellite programs, and enable compatibility with multiple launch vehicles. The full production effort includes 2 satellites with persistent infrared missile and threat warning payloads, launch vehicle integration, launch and early orbit test, dual communication band modification (unified SBand), and contractor operations support through operational acceptance.\n\nFor the GEO 5-6 block buy, the FY 2013 NDAA authorized six years of incremental production funding and limited the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3,900M. The years of incremental funding were FY 2013-2018. Advance procurement was appropriated in FY 2011 and FY 2012. GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY 2013 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items. Each year of appropriation FY 2013-2018 is in two parts, the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs. The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap.\n\nSBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads, which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&E funded). The HEO-3 and 4 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning\/Attack Assessment (ITW\/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations. HEO-1 and HEO-2 are in a storage\/residual operational mode.\n\nTotal GEO 3-4 3020\/3021 funds are $2,795.912M.\nTotal GEO 5-6 3020\/3021\/3022 funds are $3,258.940M. \nTotal HEO 3-4 3020\/3021 funds are $1,146.672M.\nTotal S2E2 3080\/3020\/3021\/3022 funds are $561.275M.\n\nSBIRS SURVIVABLE ENDURABLE EVOLUTION (S2E2): The S2E2 effort recapitalizes the DSP Mobile Ground System (MGS) DSP Mobile Ground Terminals with SBIRS Mobile Ground Terminals (SMGT) and prime mover tractor trailers. The MGS is the only US Survivable and Endurable (S\/E) Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW\/AA) system (S\/E TW\/AA). It is the critical situation monitoring element in three national-level architectures: Integrated TW\/AA System, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Critical Nodes, and Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). USSTRATCOM needs AFSPCs global S\/E TW\/AA operational capabilities to meet President of the United States, Joint Staff, Combatant Commander, and Forward User (FU) requirements for continuous, persistent, and enduring TW\/AA non-imaging infrared (NIR) for Missile Warning, static events, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) detection, and reporting across all phases of military operations. The current MGS can only process DSP data for strategic Missile Warning and NUDET detection. This effort will address long-standing obsolescence\/supportability and cyber security concerns of the MGS. This effort enables the MGS to process SBIRS and DSP satellite data. Training, software, spares, and integration of Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) are included. The shelters will also be upgraded for increased protection from high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) per MIL-STD-188-125-2. This effort includes critical operational modifications to the fixed survivable ground and S2E2 mobile system that addresses operational shortfalls and obsolescence updates up to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) acceptance.  Post IOC, the effort associated with critical operational modifications and obsolescence updates is called the SBIRS Survivable and Endurable Service Life Extension (S3LE).  \n\nSBIRS MOBILE AND FIXED SITE COMMUNICATIONS\/ELECTRONIC REPLACEMENT: This effort procures DSP and SBIRS assets to maintain the Data Processing Sub-System. Fixed site examples include, but are not limited to, legacy receiver, antenna drive system, Spacecraft Simulator Radio Frequency (RF), Mission Control Station (MCS) display, Rapid Delog (instantaneous translation of computer data to a human-readable format), Sybase database obsolescence, communications and network routers, and switches and time server replacements. Mobile system examples include, but are not limited to, aging radio frequency communications equipment, aging antenna equipment, aging electrical equipment and cabling, and unsupportable data processing subsystem components. This effort includes the recurring hardware\/software antenna obsolescence updates to S3LE and to the peacetime survivable ground effort called Rapid Adaption GEO Relay Station (RANGERS).\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in (PE) 1203915F."

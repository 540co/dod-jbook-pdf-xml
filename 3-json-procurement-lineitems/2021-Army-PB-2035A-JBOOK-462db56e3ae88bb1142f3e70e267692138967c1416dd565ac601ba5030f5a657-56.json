The QRC supports time-sensitive detection, identification, and location of advanced signals of interest (SOI), as well as the cross tipping\/cueing and collaboration of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and CEMA systems.  The systems have integrated communications gear that allow for collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination, as well as continue to reduce size, weight, power, and cost to give the Army more flexibility in employment.  Future systems and upgrades will advance SOIs and better support Long Range Precision Fires. \n\nHigh Altitude Sensing Capability ($35.000 million) provides procurement and integration to conduct a prototype of a platform\/sensor pairing to conduct Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), and Synthetic Aperture Radar\/Moving Target Indication (SAR\/MTI) collection in support of United States Army Europe (USARUER) and United States European Command (EUCOM) theater collection requirements.  This capability will fulfill the USAREUR Commander's #1 intelligence gap (indications and warnings) and provide tangential support to targeting for USEUCOM and partner land forces. \n\nCI\/HUMINT Communications Enablers ($0.300 million) will support procurement of mission critical, non-standard CI and HUMINT equipment critical for CI and HUMINT support to forces in theater and to reset\/refurbish equipment for future operations.  \n\nT-Springs ($5.000 million) will procure terrestrial SIGINT sensors to support USAREUR and EUCOM collection requirements for indications and warnings as well as targeting.  This capability addresses a EUCOM collection gap. \n\nPicket Line ($3.800 million) will procure terrestrial SIGINT sensors to support USAREUR and EUCOM collection requirements for indications and warnings as well as targeting.  This prototype unmanned collection shelter will be modular in design so it can be transported and maneuvered by any available transportation means (air, rail, maritime, or ground) and ICD 705 - compliant to meet Temporary Secure Information Facility (T-SCIF) accreditation requirements.  This capability addresses a EUCOM collection gap."

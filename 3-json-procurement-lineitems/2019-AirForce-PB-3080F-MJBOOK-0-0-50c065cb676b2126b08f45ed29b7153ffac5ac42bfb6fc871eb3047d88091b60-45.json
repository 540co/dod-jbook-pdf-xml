            "val": "This capital equipment replacement program procures, integrates, and fields High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) high frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit \/receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide. All hardware and software, including radios and antennas, is commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) with the exception of the integrating software.  The integrating software is a COTS-based product that has been configured for the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide the unique capabilities required to function as a strategic HF system. The need for modern, robust, and dependable radio stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in areas of interest to the United States. \n\nHFGCS is the DoD's single global, strategic, high-power HF Nuclear Command, Control and Communication (NC3) and non-nuclear Command and Control (C2) network serving the DOD. HFGCS consists of the two major components: the radio \/network infrastructure (Scope Command) and the antenna infrastructure (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, ships, and land-based platforms). HFGCS is USSTRATCOM's primary strategic HF pre-attack NC3 dependency system providing broadcasts to the US Air Force bomber and US Navy TACAMO fleets. HFGCS supports aircrews, ground forces, naval operations (USN and USCG), and control stations, and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include White House Communications Agency (WHCA), Defense Communications System HF Entry, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for USSTRATCOM, WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, Special Air Mission communications, Major Air Force Commands and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, State Department and Civil Air Patrol. The HFGCS network supports Overseas Contingency Operations with secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. HFGCS has also been identified as a key communications component in supporting operations in an anti-access area-denial (A2AD) environment. \n\nThe HFGCS program recently updated system consoles and routers to replace unsupportable end-of-life components and to provide increased mandated information assurance system security compliance requirements. FY19 continues to fund Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) external Defense Information System Agency interfaces to obsolete time division multiplexing (TDM) protocols.  This requires replacement of the obsolete switches and communications infrastructure supporting NC3 \/C2 operations.  Included is also Direct Mission Support \/Program Management Administration (DMS \/PMA), System Engineering, Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) installation testing and shipping costs for these procurement efforts. \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F. \n\nMilitary Necessity:  Controlled Item will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items."

            "val": "1. SCOPE COMMAND RADIO\/NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE: The Scope Command Radio\/Network Infrastructure projects continue the implementation of replacement COTS radio and console capabilities into the HFGCS network. The FY19 HFGCS Network Infrastructure program includes, but is not limited to, the Unified Capabilities\/Audio Communications Functionality (UC\/ACF), Receive Matrix Replacement Fielding, and Scope Command Server Replacement\/Integration. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Funds will be utilized for hardware updates and spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding to include, but not limited to updating existing site configurations to support modified network baselines and mandated cyber security compliance requirements.\n\nA. FY19 funding merges the UC\/ACF programs to remove duplication of effort in fielding updated audio functionality at HFGCS radio stations by replacing the obsolete Digital Electronic Switch (DES), as neither the DES nor Liberty Star-3 (LS-3) switch is on the Approved Product List and have become logistically unsupportable. \n\nB. FY19 continues to fund replacement of the new 15 Receive Matrices at the 13 radio stations, system integration lab, and spares. Funding updates existing interfacing software to control the new Receive Matrix. The existing receive matrices have become obsolete with no spare parts being manufactured to maintain the capability to interface between the radios and antennas. Installation purchase and fielding is estimated to finish in FY21.\n\nC.  FY19 funds Scope Command server replacement and installation.  The HFGCS system control servers and hosted software are becoming unsupportable and obsolete, requiring replacement.  These non-datacenter, dedicated servers control and manage all Scope Command system machine resources, control and forward messages through the HF Email capability, resource status and control services databases, and manage information assurance protection monitoring capability.  \n\n2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACEMENT: A majority of the HFGCS system antennas have been in operation for up to 45 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions such as salt water and hurricane force winds. FY19 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. FY19 efforts include, but not limited to, replacements at Puerto Rico and West Coast.  Site surveys will be conducted at, but not limited to, Yokota, Hawaii, Lajes, Sigonella and Elmendorf. This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions, to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity. Funds will be utilized for hardware updates and spares that do not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM)funding to include, but not limited to updating existing site configurations, compliance with local site installation restrictions, and mitigation of potential local environmental considerations.\n\n3. FY19 funds for program management administration costs will provide travel, financial management, engineering and technical support for the program office. FY19 also funds Direct Mission Support, including support associated with engineering, sustainment engineering, shipping, and implementation. This includes operational acceptance testing and technical interchange meetings."

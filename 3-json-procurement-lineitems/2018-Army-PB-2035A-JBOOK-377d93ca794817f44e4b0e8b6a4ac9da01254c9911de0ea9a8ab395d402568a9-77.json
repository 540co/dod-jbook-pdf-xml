There are two components to the program:  \n\nThe Network Management System (NMS) project funds the Network Operations (NetOps) Trail Boss systems engineering support to converge NetOps and Cyber capabilities across the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) in order to enable improved network security and delivery of network operations services to the Generating Forces and Operating Forces of the Army. Integrated Cyber and NetOps capabilities support distributed operational NetOps responsibilities across the tactical and strategic components of the US Army enterprise network (LANDWARNET), simplify the network management environment for the tactical commander and the G6\/S6 staff, and eliminate both functional and material redundancies in order to achieve efficiencies in fielding.\n \nData Products are required to initialize Army Tactical Mission Command Systems.  Data Products are a collection of information\/data required to plan and initialize Mission Command Systems like Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P), Command Post of the Future (CPOF) and other Army Mission Command Systems.  Information\/Data includes: JBC-P database, Network Operation Center (NOC) databases, and Active Directory initialization files (e.g., Lightweight Directory Interchange Format (LDIFs)).  Data Products enable end-to-end network centric connectivity and interoperability across the tactical internet.   AAO is N\/A."

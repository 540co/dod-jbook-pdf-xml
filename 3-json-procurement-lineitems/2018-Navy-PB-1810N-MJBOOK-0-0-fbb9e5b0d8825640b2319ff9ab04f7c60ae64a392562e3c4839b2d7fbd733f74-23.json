            "val": "The LCAC (Landing Craft Air Cushion) mission is to transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo, and personnel of the assault elements for the Marine Air\/Ground Task Force from ship-to-shore and across the beach. The LCAC rides on a cushion of air contained in a flexible skirt and is propelled by two aft-mounted, reversible, variable pitch propellers. It is capable of speeds in excess of 40 knots. The LCAC sustainment funding is programmed for equipment procurement using OPN to replace selected engines, personnel transport modules and other equipment that the fleet urgently requires to maintain acceptable levels of readiness.\n\nLC001 - LCAC SYSTEM UPGRADES\nThe LCAC System Upgrade Program provides for selected modernization through procurement and installation of components required to maintain acceptable levels of fleet operational readiness. Equipment removal and installation will take place at the two Assault Craft Units (ACUs), each of which are currently responsible for half of the craft inventory. \n\nLC002 - ENGINES\nThe ETF-40B engines are enhanced versions of the current TF-40B engines and are being provided with the rest of the SLEP craft. Recent catastrophic engine failures have highlighted the need for spare engines to reduce operational downtime. Engine procurements are also for Pack Up Kits (PUKs) that accompany fleet deployment of LCACs aboard amphibious ships. Additional ETF 40B Engines will be needed for this purpose since they are being newly introduced as part of SLEP.\n\nLC007 - LIGHTWEIGHT ARMOR\nThe portable lightweight armor system replaces the existing armor system. The portable system can be transported via a Container Express (CONEX) box and provides the Assault Craft Unit with the ability to provide ballistic\/fragmentation protection to manned spaces on the craft as well as to selected machinery components.\n\nLC008 - COLD WEATHER KITS\nLCACs are required to operate in ambient temperatures as low as 10F. Snow and ice accumulation leads to actuation of a safety system that bypasses the main engine inlet air filtration system and allows engines to draw in unfiltered air. Cold weather kits prevent snow and ice accumulation in the main engines during cold weather operations.\n\nLC009 - PERSONNEL TRANSPORT MODULE\nThe Personnel Transport Module (PTM) increases the capability of the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) to transport personnel and protect occupants from the elements inherent in an amphibious environment.\n\nLC010 - SSC FULL MISSION TRAINERS (FMT)\nShip to Shore Connector (SSC) Full Mission Trainer (FMT) is a programmable simulator and is a fundamental element of SSC operator training.  New SSC FMTs are required because LCAC FMTs will not support SSC crew training based on significant Command Module\/C4N System differences."

These include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and commercial video and products from imagery, intelligence, weather and biometric data sources.  GBS gives deployed forces access to national level repositories of intelligence products and other critical mission planning information.  This is a Joint Program and is designated as a Department of Defense Space System. The Air Force (USAF) is designated as the executive service for this Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program. The Army GBS program is designated ACAT III. The Army supports the Joint Program Office (JPO) for the development and procurement of the Transportable Ground Receive Suites (TGRS). The TGRS consists of a Receive Broadcast Manager (RBM) and a one meter satellite antenna which can receive video, imagery, and large data files. The TGRS is fielded to Battalion, Brigade Combat Teams, Division, Corps and Theater level units in active, National Guard, and reserve components."

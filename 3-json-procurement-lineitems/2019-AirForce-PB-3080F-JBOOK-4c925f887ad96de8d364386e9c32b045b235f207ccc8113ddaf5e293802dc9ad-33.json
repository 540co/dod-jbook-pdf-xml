            "val": "Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.\n\nDEAMS deployments include:\n- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)\n- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome\n- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)\n- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan\n- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio\n- Air Force Material Command (AFMC), and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) \n- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs\n\nOn 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increments. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Increment (Inc) 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and the updated FDD criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017. Full Deployment Decision (FDD) threshold date is August 2020 and Full Deployment (FD) threshold date is February 2021.  \n\nThe remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes Oracle R12 upgrade transition to a new production environment, hardware upgrade, reporting, auditing, and disbursing initiatives.\n\nDEAMS Inc 1 funding through FY 2020 is to support Inc 1 deployments. DEAMS Inc 2 funding begins in FY2022 and will support Inc 2 deployments. DEAMS Inc 1 and Inc 2 will require software user licenses to support system deployments as well as potential software and hardware requirements needed to manage, execute, and deliver DEAMS system capability including necessary system upgrades. \n\nProcurement funding for DEAMS is in PE 0901538F, Financial Management Information Systems Development (FMISD)."

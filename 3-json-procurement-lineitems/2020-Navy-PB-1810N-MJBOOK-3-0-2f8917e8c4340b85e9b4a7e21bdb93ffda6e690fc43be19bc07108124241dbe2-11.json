            "val": "The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $3.747 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThis line provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment.  Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.\n\n[P40A \/ SURFACE TRAINING ADVANCED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (STAVE) SEAFRAME SIMULATORS]: STAVE-LCS SEAFRAME SIMULATORS - Funds procure Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) tactical training simulators and equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) in Newport, Rhode Island. Simulators meet the Train to Qualify\/ Train to Certify (T2Q\/T2C) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers and the installation of this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) in each homeport and at SWOS enabling the increased throughput for 32 ships \/ 56 crews \/ 3,920 Sailors supporting CNO approved BLUE GOLD Plus crewing strategy and directly supporting the revised training requirements of the Navy's Comprehensive Review. This procurement enables ship Commanding Officers to witness watch stander crew performance under high-stress conditions given realistic at sea scenarios in the synthetic environment. Trainers are required for each ship variant, located in the San Diego and Mayport homeports and at SWOS. Throughput of LCS crews requires more than one simulator of each variant in a homeport.\n\n1.1) STAVE-LCS Virtual Reality Labs & Networks and Modernization - Funds comprehensive network infrastructure and computing environment and Virtual Reality Labs (VRLs), within the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) to support delivery and management of all components of LCS watch stander training. This modernization enables enhanced warfighter scenario training for the LCS crews in Combat Systems qualifications and ship systems troubleshooting, through the virtual network, without which, no systems within the LTF (currently being built in San Diego, and funded for Mayport) will interoperate or communicate with each other.  Both LTFs are being built and designed around a central computer server farm (backbone) that houses all courseware, training scenarios, and student records.  Without the network infrastructure, there is no way to distribute the required courseware and software around the LTF. Without the VRLs, there is no method of presenting previously developed Immersive Virtual Ship Environment (IVSE) courseware to students. Modernization efforts include regular\/scheduled updates\/upgrades to the STAVE Network and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, along with the procurement of replacement Virtual Reality Lab (electronic classroom) equipment supporting increased crew throughput.\n\n1.2) STAVE-LCS Mission Bay Trainers & Modernization - Enable the qualification, training, and team certification of the individuals and teams deploying the LCS main battery - Mission Packages (MP).  Live scenarios include prepping and launching\/recovering of multi-ton mission module off-hull remote vehicles and operating of the internal cranes, doors, and other associated equipment in the Mission Bay.  Modernizations provide updated MP deployment and recovery capability for enhanced warfighting readiness the individual full-scale replicas of the Mission Bay for both variants.  Without the Mission Bay Trainer, there will be no realistic controlled scenario homeport training in the Mission Bay operations for the San Diego or Mayport-based crews and detachments during training pipeline, or off-hull, rapid refresh crew team training, and the primary warfare area (the Mission Bay) for the LCS ships will have no shore-based, controlled training capability in San Diego and Mayport, in this high-risk area of Mission Bay operations.\n\n1.3) STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers & ITT Modernization - These are full scale simulators of the Tactical Software enabling, initial and proficiency, integrated team training of Bridge, Combat Systems, Engineering, and Mission Package systems\/watch stations. The ITT delivers Detect to Engage sequencing of ships Combat Systems and developing watch stander Command and Control for our future Navy warfighters. The quantity and type (based on variant) of trainers in San Diego and Mayport is dependent on the Navy's Strategic Laydown of the Littoral Combat Ships. Follow on ITT procurements will include integrated crew served weapon simulators (discussed below). Modernization to the ITT's enable ships baseline upgrades and realistic combat scenarios compatible with individual crew Combat System baseline to prepare crews for in Battle Force training. Without the ITTs, there is no way for the LCS crews and detachments to train in-port, as the LCS ships do not have an onboard training system requirement. Ships would have to train underway utilizing real targets and other Fleet assets, such as drones, and commercial air services to accomplish required qualifications and certifications for all of their training.  The LCS Concept of Operations does not support such at-sea intensive training requirements. \n\n1.5) STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactics Trainer Complete System - Procurement of the complete trainer to include Bridge Training System, Combats Training System and Engineering Training System.\n\n1.6)  STAVE-LCS Bridge Trainers and Modernization - Devices that permit selected aspects of Bridge tasks (including Readiness Control Officer [RCO] tasks) to be practiced independently of Combat Systems Operations as found in more capable ITTs. This facilitates more efficient accomplishment of T2Q and T2C objectives. This trainer supports Officer training pipeline at SWOS, Newport in support of Division Officer, Department Head, and PXO\/PCO training pipeline for Officer of the Deck Training and rapid refresh and skills enhancement in Mayport.\n\n1.7) STAVE-LCS Tactical Action Officer Trainers Modernization - Modernization efforts include upgrades to the trainers through procurement of new servers, relays and switches as well as new consoles, joysticks and communication equipment. \n\n1.8) STAVE-LCS Combat Systems Part Task Trainers (C2 PTT) (LCS 1 and LCS 2) .  These devices permit training in selected aspects of Combat Systems Operations that are found in the more capable ITTs, to support individual skills development and practice, reduce the wear and tear on the ITTs, and allow the ITTs to more efficiently accommodate team training and certifications.\n\n[P40A \/ Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT) to Sea]: Investment provides updates to update the Combined Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Trainer (CIAT) to establish a foundation for bringing this capability to AEGIS and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Baselines for ship integration to provide live, virtual, constructive (LVC) training in a contested environment.

            "val": "FY 2020 funding provides the Fleet with the required training equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS). Training equipment is required to satisfy the Train to Qualify Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Required procurements of hardware and software associated with building the trainers and installing this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities in each homeport and at SWOS. Trainers are required for both of the ship variants. Increased FY 2020 funding for LCS Seaframe Simulators supports the training portion of the procurement of additional LCS Bridge Part Task Trainers, curriculum development and training devices to meet increased training requirements (~2,390 students) due to the change to Blue Gold crewing and additional ships and crews delivering in the FYDP. This increase supports both the Personnel and Training Pillars. The Bridge Part Task Trainers (BPTTs) provide valuable training to the sailors. Procurement and Modernization of these trainers is required to meet the current\/updated configuration of LCS. Without the procurements\/modernization of these trainers, in accordance with SWOS analysis, sailors will be forced to use outdated equipment\/technology. Without the training, sailors will be unable to safely operate the equipment onboard ships, to include Mission Module equipment thus potentially putting the safety of those sailors, and the mission of the ship, at significant risk. \n\nThe FY20 increase in funding growth for BFTT supports the delivery and sustainment of distributed STAVE-CS hardware suites for maintaining training for over 10,000 students and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) hardware for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capabilities to meet Strike Group Training Requirements, and delivery capability to enable at sea training.\n\nThe FY20 congressional reduction in FY19 for BFTT Ship Sets in the amount of $2.63 million.\n\nThe phasing of this requirement is based on achieving Ready for Training (RFT) dates for various shipboard systems based on system complexity and procurement lead times, which is aligned to the CVN78 deployment ready status and the INITIAL training requirements of the CVN79 Crew.\n\nThe FY20 funding for Surface Training Device Modifications provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment. Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.  Increased funding is required in FY20 for the following efforts, in order to support Fleet readiness and ensure that sailors are properly trained to operate and maintain mission critical systems and effectively execute their missions:  1) Navigation Training Support, per the DON directed Comprehensive Review, for the modernization of all Surface Navigation, Seamanship, and Ship-handling Trainers (NSST) in all CONUS and OCONUS Fleet Concentration Areas as well as various schoolhouse locations, in support of the Comprehensive Review - Implementation of Surface Warfare Recommendations; and 2) Navy Training System Plan (NTSP) updates to formal courses of instruction, required to reflect current Fleet configurations.\n\nNAVIGATION TRAINING SUPPORT - FY20 funding increases address navigation shortfalls identified during CNO-directed Comprehensive Review following the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald collisions and provide for modifications\/upgrades to Navigation Shore Based Trainers, to support the modernization of all Surface Navigation, Seamanship, and Ship-handling Trainers (NSST) in all CONUS and OCONUS Fleet Concentration Areas as well as various schoolhouse locations. Modernization is critical to maintaining trainer service life and avoiding increased costs to maintain aging equipment. Per the DON directed Comprehensive Review - Implementation of Surface Warfare Recommendations, the increase in FY20 funding is in response to directives to provide an integrated NSST and Combat Information Center (CIC) training capability, and will support the creation of system specific simulations, high fidelity bridge team trainers at nine locations, radar navigation team trainers at nine locations, additional classrooms (four) with a capacity of 30 students in each classroom and updates to Inertial Navigation system\/subsystem curriculum w\/simulation commencing in FY20.\n\nNAVY TRAINING SYSTEM PLAN (NTSP Technical Training Equipment (TTE)\/Training Device (TD) Mods) - FY20 funding is required to support formal courses of instruction that will require NTSP updates in order to reflect current Fleet configurations.  Failure to update these courses will decrease Sailors' ability to operate and maintain these critical systems, hindering ships from effectively executing missions and negatively impacting Fleet readiness.\nFunds are provided for the procurement and installation of training equipment and associated logistic support package as outlined in the NTSPs.  \n\nDDG 1000 WHOLENESS\/SURFACE STRIKE - FY19 funding will procure shipboard connectivity suites (SCS) for installation aboard the DDG 1000 ships.  The SCS units are required to establish network communications between the DDG 1000 embedded training system and the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) in support of pier-side Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events.  FST events are conducted by the fleet to certify crew, ship and strike groups prior to deployment.\n\nSHIP TO SHORE CONNECTOR (SSC) FULL MISSION TRAINERS (FMT) - Funds SSC FMT which is a programmable simulator and is a fundamental element of SSC operator training.  New SSC FMTs are required because LCAC FMTs will not support SSC crew training based on significant Command Module\/C4N System differences.

                        "val": "The Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT)\/Advanced Training Domain (ATD)\/Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) family of systems provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict; realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas; a means to link ships together which are in different homeports for coordinated training; external stimulation of shipboard training systems; and simulation of non-shipboard forces. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT uses a distributed architecture, integrating existing training systems, and uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Strike Group\/Battle Force (SG\/BF) Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Groups (ATGs), the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Training (FSTs)\/Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) exercises. The Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) integrates existing and emergent onboard training and assessment system capabilities to simulate realistic, \"train like you fight\", combat-like conditions across weapon sensor and combat systems. Migration to TSTC improvements is required to ensure continued, persistent FST\/LVC interoperability to deliver training that is commensurate with tactical capabilities. Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Obsolescence mitigates replacement and upgrade of obsolete and out-of-production COTS components in BFTT systems installed throughout the Fleet to include the AN\/USQ-T46D upgrade. BFTT T46D and ATD\/T52 are core components of the TSTC.\n\nBFTT T46D Ship set configurations vary depending on AEGIS or Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) installation.  T46D's for SSDS include additional materials and units to be integrated for stimulation of the ships sensors.\n\nFY20 - TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (5) T46D's and (9) T52's and subsequent variants of hardware and software for Build 5.x series in support of AN\/SQQ-89 upgrades, AN\/SLQ-32(V)6 upgrades, AN\/USG-2B upgrades, and ATD software builds in support of AEGIS Baseline 9 TI-16 upgrades and SSDS upgrades -- which drives the difference in unit cost. Installation funding supports installation of (17) BFTT AN\/USQ-T46D Systems.  Additional costs will be incurred to procure more materials needed to meet integrated CEC training requirements, cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) to meet shipboard integrated training demands."

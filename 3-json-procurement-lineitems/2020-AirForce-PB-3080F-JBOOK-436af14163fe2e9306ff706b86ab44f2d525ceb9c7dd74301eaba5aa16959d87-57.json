            "val": "This program funds for the procurement of Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE). It provides the capability to receive, store, and issue petroleum products and support aircraft generation where fixed systems do not exist or require augmentation. FORCE is a subset of the Pre-Positioned War Reserve Capabilities (PWRC), it is a Force Generation Set (FGS) that provides mission oriented operational capability packages\/force modules aligned with the air and space expeditionary task force modules described in AFI 10-401, AF Operations Planning and Execution, and this instruction. This program serves a critical role in support of the Combatant Commanders(COCOM)requirements to support 5 Major OPLANS, and ensures the objectives of the Asian Pacific Stability and European Defense Initiatives can be executed.\n\nFuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE Starter (FS), Receipt (RC)and Sustainment (SC) is a deployable modular fuel system that can provide joint capability to fuel aircraft and support equipment at forward locations.  The FORCE system can be configured to perform limited aircraft fueling missions or to sustain massive daily fueling requirements for months.  FORCE is capable of receiving, transferring, and issuing fuel at a throughput rate of 900 Gallons per Minute (GPM).  The individual pieces of equipment that comprise the FORCE system provide stand-alone or mix-and-match capability for almost any fuel transfer or aircraft refueling scenario.  The full capability mission of the complete FORCE System, when used in conjunction with fabric fuel bladders, provides a deployable, above ground, constant pressure, flow-on demand fueling system for aircraft, i.e., a hydrant-type fueling system. \n\n Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System (ABFDS), designed for aerial delivery of fuel to locations where other methods of transportation are impractical, it enables aircraft to rapidly transport fuel to locations close to or behind enemy lines. It is the key component to the AFSOC community and their ability to complete Forward Area Refueling Point missions(FARP).\n\n3K Collapsible Fuel Tanks (CFT) are specifically designed to be loaded on military aircraft and withstand the critical demands put on them during flight operations, in conjunction with the ABFDS they provide the ability to transfer fuel from the aircraft storage bladder while aircraft engines are running.\n\nCollapsible Fuel Tanks (CFT) or more commonly referred to as fuel bladders provide fuel storage capabilities at austere or forward operating locations where infrastructure is either inadequate or non-existent. Bladders sizes range from 10K, 50K and 210K gallons of fuel storage, these bladders are capable of holding a multitude of petroleum products to support both air and ground operations. Collapsible fuel tanks are used with Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) to support various aircraft systems at forward operating locations.\n\n500 Gal LOX\/Lin Tanks, are deployable liquid oxygen\/liquid nitrogen storage tanks that can receive, store, and issue liquid oxygen or nitrogen products to service carts or smaller tanks.  Provides bulk storage capacity and is used to fill smaller cryogenic equipment (8 Cylinder trailers, 50 Gallon LOX Tank) and aircraft.\n\nFuels Pumping & Distribution provides multiple capabilities to receive and deliver petroleum products to initiate and sustain ground and air operations for both expeditionary and contingency operations. Ensures the ability to service smaller aircraft such as UAV's and base support vehicles, and increases the distance that fuel loads can be safely distributed to the base up to 3 miles. \n\nPrevious Fuels requirements were levied under BPAC 845990 \/ Base Maintenance and Support Equipment , starting in FY20 all FORCE requirements fall under BPAC 845550.\n\n\nThe Program Element associated with this P-1 Line is: 28031F\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

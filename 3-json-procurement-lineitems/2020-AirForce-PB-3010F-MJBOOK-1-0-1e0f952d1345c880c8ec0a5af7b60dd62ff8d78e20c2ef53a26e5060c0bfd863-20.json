Among gliders there are two TG-15A aircraft with a design service life of 6,000 hours, three TG-15B aircraft with a design service life of 6,000 hours, and 19 TG-16A aircraft with a design service life of 12,000.  Powered flight consists of four T-41D aircraft with a design service life of 60,000 hours, three T-51A aircraft with a design service life of 60,000 hours and 24 T-53A aircraft with a design service life of 12,000 hours.  To support parachute jumping there are three UV-18B aircraft with a design service life of 40,000 hours.  The primary effort in FY20 is Low Cost Modifications, which includes various AF Academy simulator system procurements, FAA Service Bulletin, Air Worthiness Directives, studies, and civilian pay and CMEs in support of program activities.  \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0804748F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

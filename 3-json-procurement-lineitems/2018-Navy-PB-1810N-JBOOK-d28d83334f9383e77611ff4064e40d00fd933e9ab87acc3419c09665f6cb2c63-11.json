            "val": "This budget provides funding for targeted modernization of various HM&E systems on board Amphibious Assault Ships.  Modernization efforts include the procurement and installation of: High Efficiency Small-Capacity (HES-C) Air Conditioning Compressors; various Interior Communications (IC) systems; automated Electric Plant controls and circuit breakers as part of the Power Management Platform (PMP); Brushless Generators for the PMP; main feed pump replacement; steam fire pump replacement; Shipboard Air Traffic Control Communications (SATCC); and Navigation Critical Data System (NCDS\/NavCrit).\n\n HES-C provides additional air conditioning capability to support growing electronic cooling requirements. IC Systems modernization provides up to date IC system installations necessary to maintain critical communications internal to the ships.  Electric Plant controls and circuit breaker installation provides modern electric plant controls as part of the overall PMP to improve survivability and increase electric plant reliability. Brushless Generator replacement will reduce down time, total ownership costs, and maintenance costs associated with antiquated brush type generators. Main feed pump procurement and install replaces obsolete main feed pumps for the main propulsion boiler.  Steam driven fire pumps are replaced with variable speed drive (VSD) electric fire pumps eliminating a substantial maintenance driver for the LHA\/LHD Class Ships. Additionally, funding supports procurement and installation of SATCC and Navigation Critical Data Distribution (NavCrit) systems in support of capability requirements on Amphibious Assault Ships.\n\n[P40A \/ Conjunctive HM&E Alterations]: LH002 Conjunctive HM&E Alterations includes design integration, equipment procurement, recurring equipment engineering, equipment integration and Integrated Logistics Services (ILS).\n\n[P40A \/ Conjunctive HM&E Alterations]: LH002 Conjunctive HM&E Alterations includes design integration, equipment procurement, recurring equipment engineering, equipment integration and Integrated Logistics Services (ILS)."

This system gathers and combines all Electric plant data so that it is available at any electric plant control station.  PMP simplifies multiple step control sequences into single step operations and makes possible control capabilities that were previously too cumbersome for operators to perform. i.e. Baseload, and Real \/ Reactive power balancing. PMP implements a gradual Ship Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) turbine startup\/shutdown sequence which allows the turbine to achieve stabilized temperatures more consistently, reducing stress on components and contributing to prolonged service life.  System automation reduces electrical system transients and stress on breaker components by employing a Zero Power Transfer (ZPT) strategy, which limits the current flow through an individual breaker to zero during open\/close evolutions.  \nSwitchboard Breaker Upgrade and Power Management Platform (Electric Plant Controls) must be installed concurrently.  Collectively, these two non-severable modernization efforts provide enhanced electric plant (EP) situational awareness, reliability flexibility, and survivability through replacement of obsolete breakers with breakers currently used in other ship classes and through installation of modern electric plant controls and alarms.  Brushless Generator Install must be accomplished prior to or concurrent with Switchboard Breaker Upgrade and Power Management Platform (Electric Plant Controls)."

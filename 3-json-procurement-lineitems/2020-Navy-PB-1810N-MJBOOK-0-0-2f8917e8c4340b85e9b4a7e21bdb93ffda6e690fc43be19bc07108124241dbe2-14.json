            "val": "DDG 1000, a multi-mission surface combatant, will serve as a versatile asset in the context of future Naval Strategy.  Armed with an array of weapons, DDG 1000 will provide the Joint Force Commander with precision strike and volume fires.  Designed with sustainable payload, multi-spectral stealth and optimal manning, DDG 1000 will take the fight to the enemy with unprecedented striking power.\n\nProgram provides for DDG 1000 combat system hardware\/equipment suite technology refresh to support obsolescence management and address reliability, maintainability & availability (RM&A) issues following fielding. Combat System hardware will be approaching 10 years of age at time of delivery. Active management of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) obsolescence via hardware\/equipment technology refresh will be required to ensure DDG 1000 class ships reach their design service life. Additionally, program will sustain and upgrade in-service DDG 1000 ships in order to achieve their Expected Service Life (ESL). Upgrades will be mission capable in countering current and projected threats, improve operational capabilities, and comply with requirements.\n\nAfter a comprehensive review of Zumwalt class requirements, Navy decided in November 2017 to refocus the primary mission of the Zumwalt Class Destroyers from Land Attack to Offensive Surface Strike.  The FY19 funds will facilitate this change in mission and add lethal, offensive fires against targets afloat and ashore.  These changes include integration of SM-6 capability, Maritime Strike Tomahawk Integration, and organic cryptologic collection equipment (SPECTRAL).  In order to maintain the required radar signature, an upgrade in off-board platform communications to the Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) is also required, paired with the SPECTRAL system. \n\nThe Advanced Gun Systems will remain on the ships, but in an inactive status for future use, when a gun round that can affordably meet the desired capability is developed and fielded.\n\nFact of Life Changes impacted ability to execute Data Center Tech Refresh.  Funding realigned to address a sub set of TSCE tech refresh and higher priority fleet requirements for On Board Trainer (OBT).\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Class On Board Trainer]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of On Board Training (OBT) environment hardware for the ZUMWALT Class to include DDG 1000, 1001 and 1002.  OBT allows the ship's combat system to enter into a simulated environment and stimulate the combat system with non-real training tracks, allowing the crew to exercise their system and prepare for real world scenarios.  This OBT capability, as requested by the fleet, is necessary to ensure the ship is prepared for deployment.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Class Operating System Refresh]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of critical operating systems and targeted technology refresh of the technical baseline for DDG 1000 Embedded Distributed Adaptation Processors (EDAPs), Wireless Access Points (WAPS), and Cameras. Technology refresh includes non-recurring systems engineering required to plan for and integrate the newly procured EDAPs, WAPs, and network IP video cameras. The systems engineering efforts consisted of identifying and developing design approaches for applications or hardware assemblies that required re-architecture or redesign due to changes in the COTS designs.  \n\nEDAPs provide the electrical and logical interfaces to Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) via the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) network.  EDAP procurements necessary to support the DDG 1000 Class Operating System upgrade to ensure Information Assurance (IA) compliance.  The hardware procurement will provide the DDG 1000 Class ships critical upgrades to support required integration allowing the DDG 1000 Class ships to operate as a multi-mission warfare platform.\n\nWireless Access Points (WAPs) provide shipboard wireless connectivity to the TSCEI throughout the ship. \n\nCameras (fixed and Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ)) provide the necessary monitoring and safe operation of unmanned spaces and are integrated into the TSCE. These cameras are primarily a watch-stander situational awareness tool which augments the manning reductions on DDG 1000 class ships. This procurement replaces obsolete and unsupported legacy camera systems (including sensors, pan\/tilt, unit, controllers and other HW).\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Class Product Improvement]: Funding will support ship alteration (Shipalt) prioritization and planning through shipyard installations during availabilities. Other modernization efforts include but are not limited to logistics and technical documentation, engineering services and Alteration Installation Team (AITs) within the Fleet Modernization Program (FMP). Funding will procure DDG 1000 Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) network switches which are critical items required to support DDG 1000 Data Center technology refresh. These TSCE network switches support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, address obsolescence, and require configuration engineering prior to installation. Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems.\n\n[P40A \/ Critical Cybersecurity Upgrades and Improvements]: The Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) integrates all the ship's sensors and weapons into a cohesive Combat System (CS). The TSCE is integrated with an array of sensors and weapons that exchange data across the domains with the core network using a series of buffering computers known as Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs). The new ZUMWALT Class ship design has reliable and effective land-attack maritime dominance capabilities that meet stringent signature goals, which are interoperable with Joint forces.\n\nFunding required for hardware procurement and hardware engineering support to support Windows 10 Upgrade, Linux Kernel Integrity Validation tool, and Secure Data Distribution Services equipment.  Windows 10 upgrade is required to support existing capabilities, prevent cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and is mandated by OPNAV requirements.  Installation of Linux Kernel Integrity Validation tool will upgrade methods for detecting malicious activity (including \"Zero-day\" attacks) in order to keep pace with ongoing threats.  Secure Data Distribution Services will provide comprehensive detection and countermeasure capabilities to ensure data confidentiality and integrity, and will help keep pace with ongoing threats.\n\n[P40A \/ Common Display System]: The Common Display System (CDS), an integral part of the TSCE infrastructure, consists of  information-display consoles\/peripherals that display the integrated data required to operate the ship and its systems. There are 40 consoles on each Zumwalt Class ship and  22 consoles in the shore trainer facility.  The CDS variant on ZUMWALT class are unique configuration based on a 10 year old design and should be aligned with ongoing modernization efforts in the Fleet.\n\n[P40A \/ TSCE Diminishing Manufacturing Sources & Material Shortages (DMSMS)]: FY20 OPN funding is required to procure ZUMWALT Class ships network and computing equipment to address obsolescence and DMS concerns to sustain the ZUMWALT Class TSCE and minimize total operation costs. Fifty percent of TSCE components are currently obsolete and obsolescence forecasts predict ninety percent obsolete by FY20. NRE is based on SD-22 solution costs adjusted for inflation for current and predicted obsolescence. Funding is required to maintain ship readiness; without funding, obsolescence in ZUMWALT Class network and computing environments will impact the ship's ability to get underway, increase cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and decrease capacity for sparing.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Maritime Strike Tomahawk Integration]: Maritime Strike Tomahawk Integration\nFunding required for software development, integration and test (RDT&E) and hardware and ILS (OPN)\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 N-CC-1\/3 Integration]: Integration of SM-6 capability.  \nFunding required for Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) Integration (OPN), testing, and Live Fire Testing (RDT&E).\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 NTCDL Integration]: Upgrade Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) to Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) by removing TCDL from 07 level and replacing with deckhouse mounted NTCDL. TCDL is a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) antenna which SPAWAR supports whereas NTCDL is a full program of record. Would increase capacity for Common Data Link (CDL) links, as well as freeing up 07 space and improve Radar Cross Section (RCS) to allow for installation of other antennas. Improves signature and increases capacity of CDL links.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Spectral Integration]: Upgrade Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment Increment F (SSEE Inc F) antennas to meet DDG 1000 RCS requirements.  Utilize previous research and treatment methods to develop antenna set for SSEE INC F \/ Spectral that meets RCS requirements. Adds warfighting capability to the ship while not sacrificing signature of the ship."

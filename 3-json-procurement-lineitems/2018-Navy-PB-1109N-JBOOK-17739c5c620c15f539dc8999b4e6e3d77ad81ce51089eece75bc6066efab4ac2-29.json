            "val": "The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Payloads integration program will alleviate Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability gaps caused by rapidly changing missions, threats and technologies. It will provide responsive capability to integrate and support rapid fielding of ISR payloads for all UAS within the Marine Corps. Sensor payloads will increase the effectiveness and versatility of the Marine Corps UAS currently planned to have the Electro-Optic(EO) \/ Infrared (IR) collection, communications relay, and automatic identification capabilities. Upgrades include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)\/ Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) \/ Moving Target Indicator (MTI), and Wide Area and Hyperspectral Imagery collection.\n\nIn FY18 the UAS Payloads procurement line was expanded to include funding for Marine Corps Group I UAS system intelligence payloads.  P-5 cost elements were broken out to reflect the payload procurement in support of Group III and Group I UAS.\n\nGroup I and III SIGINT\/ES payloads will fill current capability gaps for the Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission and is required as part of the Marine Corps mission to locate and target adversary Signals of Interest (SOI).\n\nGroup I Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET) provide the RQ-11 RAVEN and the RQ-20 PUMA extended communications and data relay, utilizing radios such as the AN\/PRC-117G and the ANW2 waveform.  MANET provides Marine Corps ground units an organic airborne communication relay which allows the transmission of mission critical intelligence.\n\nGroup III Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Moving Target Indicator (MTI) will be integrated for Marine Corps small tactical UAS. This capability fills current capability gaps for the ISR mission and will allow Marine Corps ISR assets to locate and track ground targets that cannot effectively be located or tracked with the current ground based sensor technology. The ability to locate and track moving ground targets from small tactical UAVs is an essential capability that facilitates the six functions of Marine Corps Aviation and the Marine Corps ISR Enterprise across the range of military operations.\n\nGroup III Wide Area Persistent Surveillance (WAS) provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with organic airborne Wide Area Surveillance.  The Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) payload collects and records Electro Optical \/ Infrared (EO\/IR) images over a wide area in order to conduct persistent surveillance of large areas of interest, in near real time, while recording data to enable forensics.  The WAS payload will provide the Marine Corps the ability to disseminate multiple high resolution sub-sampled imagery windows to multiple users."

The increase of $11.222M from FY2017 to FY2018 provides newly developed payloads to address capability gaps caused by rapidly changing missions, threats, and technologies.  In addition, there was an increase due to the expansion of this BLI to include Group I payloads realigned from BLI 4757 ($3.951M).\n\nOCO: \nFY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)Request: N\/A"

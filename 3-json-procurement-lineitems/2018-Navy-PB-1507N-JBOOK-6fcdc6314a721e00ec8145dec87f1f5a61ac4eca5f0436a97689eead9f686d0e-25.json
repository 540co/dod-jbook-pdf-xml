Its operation consists of a dynamic run trajectory that is actively controlled in depth and course with pre-programmable run maneuvers emulating threat submarines and is detectable by all current U.S. ASW Platforms.\n\nThe MK-30 is an ASW training target for Navy surface ships, submarines, and aircrafts that are capable of simulating submarine threats anticipated in the twenty-first century littoral warfare environment. \n\nThe MK-30 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) extends the useful service life of MK-30 ASW Targets to meet annual fleet training requirements.\n\n[P5 \/ TG002 - MK39 MOD 2 EMATT]: Funding under this cost code provides for the procurement of MK-39 MOD 2 EMATT vehicles and nonrecurring engineering (NRE).  NRE pays for the cost of Pre-Proof of Manufacturing (POM) units and POM units, first article testing, tooling and test equipment, procurement of technical data package updates, start-up costs, and other one-time costs for production contractors.\n\n[P5 \/ TG007 - MK30 SLEP]: Funding under this cost code provides for extending the service life for the MK-30 ASW Targets.\n\n[P5 \/ TG832 - MK39 MOD 2 EMATT PROD ENG (IN-HOUSE)]: Funding under this cost code provides for production engineering tasks performed by NUWC NPT and KPT including EMATT program management support, systems engineering, and production engineering.\n\n[P5 \/ TG842 - MK39 MOD 2 EMATT QUALITY ASSURANCE]: Funding under this cost code provides for quality assurance efforts in support of the EMATT program.\n\n[P5 \/ TG862 - MK39MOD 2 EMATT ACCEPTANCE T&E]: Funding under this cost code provides for production acceptance of contractor hardware for the EMATT program.\n\n[P5 \/ TG900 - MK39 MOD 2 EMATT CONSULTING SERVICES]: Funding under this cost code provides for contractor support services at the program office."

            "val": "FY 2018:\nTG002: Increases in MK-39 MOD 2 EMATT Targets to procure 1,000 EMATT targets to recover from very low inventory levels to meet Non-Combat Expenditure Allocations (NCEA) and to meet future Fleet ASW Training Requirements.  The unit price reflects actual contract unit price for EMATT.  Unit price is stepladder, so minor funding changes may result in large quantity changes.  \n\nTG007: The funding increase in the MK-30 MOD 1 Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which extends the MK-30 MOD 1 ASW Target Service Life to continue the use of MK-30 ASW Target for the foreseeable future, addresses future Submarine Force ASW Fleet Training requirements due to the cancellation of the Advanced Expendable ASW Training Target MK-1 MOD 0 Parrotfish program."

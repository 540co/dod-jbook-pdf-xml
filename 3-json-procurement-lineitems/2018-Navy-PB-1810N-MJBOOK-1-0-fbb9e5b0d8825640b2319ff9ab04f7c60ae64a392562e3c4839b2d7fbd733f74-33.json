            "val": "The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) tasked Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) with the requirement to provide shore based Air Traffic Control (ATC) terminal facilities and equipment that are required to efficiently and safely monitor and direct military and commercial air traffic in national and international air space.  Many of these systems are required to interface through automated means with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  Additionally, NAVAIR has material support responsibility for Air Navigation Aid Systems, Mobile ATC Equipment, Special Instrumentation Systems, and Ancillary Equipment used for ATC and Landing Systems (LS) by the Navy and Marine Corps.  This Landing Systems program, in conjunction with the Fleet ATC Systems and the National Airspace System Modernization program provide the three pillars by which the Navy supports and meets established requirements to modernize and ensure reliable, safe and effective operations of ATC & LS used at the Navy and Marine Corps air stations worldwide.\n\nLanding Systems budget provides funding to modernize and ensure the reliability of Precision Approach Radars (PAR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) systems, Instrument Landing System (ILS), and other air navigation aids used by the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nPAR Commercial-off-the-shelf (FPN-68) Upgrade replaces obsolete PAR systems (FPN-63) continuing fleet shore based Precision Approach capability. Additionally PAR (FPN-63) ECP's  consist of the Modulator Board Upgrade ECP, the Antenna Upgrade ECP, the Configuration Upgrade ECP, the Turntable Upgrade ECP, the Fiber Optic Inter-site System (FOIS) ECP, the Angle Voltage Generator (AVG) Upgrade ECP, and the Technology Refresh Upgrade ECP currently known as PAR COTs. These ECPs will extend the life of the FPN-63 until they are replaced, by the FPN-68.\nTACAN Upgrade ECPs update old technology and extend the service life of the TACAN. The TACAN sustainment consists of the Antenna Upgrade ECP, the Shelter Upgrade ECP and the Beacon Upgrade ECP.\nILS Systems provide the Navy and Marine Corps with a self-contained Precision Landing capability at selected Air Stations, to meet fleet requirements for safe aircraft recovery. \n\nFunding for Procurements, support cost and associated installs for FY2017 and beyond have been realigned to Ashore ATC Equipment (BLI 2820)."

            "val": "ORDNANCE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT provides funds for the procurement of gun, missile, and ASW fire control and support equipment, mine components, FBM support equipment, and support for other expendable ordnance. This budget activity is coordinated by the Naval Sea Systems Command.\n\nThis line also provides funds to modify\/upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment and to implement Training Enhancement Changes (TECs) to the trainer systems capabilities.\n\n[P40A \/ TD002: SUBMARINE TRAINING DEVICE MODS]: Provides funding for modifications which are upgrades to submarine training systems and TECs which are centrally managed systems. These improvements\/upgrades are required to keep training systems, such as the Ship Control Operator Trainer (SCOT) and Submarine Bridge Trainer (SBT), compatible with equivalent changes made to fleet operational equipment and to change trainer capabilities to meet emergent training requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ TD006: SUB COAET]: TD006 SUBMARINE COMMON OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINER  (COAET)The COAET is an interactive, fundamental skills-level and employment skills trainer.  It  allows for introduction of new fleet requirements and upgrades. The purpose of these devices is to provide operator and  introductory team training to submarine force personnel prior to entry into the full-up Submarine Multi Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT).  It also provides supplemental training to off-load the heavily utilized attack center trainers.  COAET provides training utilizing partial tactical builds and emulations of the latest Sonar and Combat Control Systems.  These devices provide an environment substantially equivalent to that found on board ship, thus enabling students to develop and maintain the attack center expertise necessary to support Fleet operations. Also provides funding for TECs, integration of Virtualized Tactical Control (VTAC), Advanced Processing Build (APB)\/ Technical Insertion (TI), and Sonar Tactical Decision Aid (STDA) implementation.\n\n[P40A \/ TD009: SMMTT PH3]: TD009 SUBMARINE MULTI MISSION TEAM TRAINER (SMMTT)To achieve desired submarine force readiness levels, it is necessary to construct highly sophisticated shore based Combat System Team Trainers capable of training personnel in all aspects of submarine approach, attack and surveillance operations in a controlled, simulated environment.  Includes funding for TECs.\nThe Combat Control System (CCS) AN\/BYG-1 is installed on SSN\/SSBN\/SSGN Class submarines, and there are currently plans to further upgrade these systems with the hardware revisions which provide enhanced warfighter capabilities.  The Tactical Acoustic Rapid COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) Insertion (ARCI) AN\/BQQ-10 phased upgrades are being installed with the next revision which provides enhanced warfighter capabilities. These CCS and ARCI upgrades to the AN\/BYG1 and BQQ-10 systems directly impact shore based Team Trainers.  SMMTT also includes annual Tactical Imaging TI\/APB upgrades that support multiple classes of submarines. The Submarine Multi-Mission Team Trainer (SMMTT) supports operator, employment and training for enlisted and officer pipelines for these systems.  The SMMTT provides operators and combat teams the ability to train ashore, prior to, and between deployments.  The shore based training provides a means of maintaining team proficiency prior to ship deployment. SMMTT is also used for SSN\/SSGN crew certification.  SMMTT replaced all Military (MIL) Standard hardware in previous systems with commercial emulation hardware, enabling platform independence and wide area network capability.  The use of Open Architecture (OA) trainer systems allows for the continuous growth of functional flexibility ultimately leading to employment training conducted for any submarine combat system.   Plans are established to likewise upgrade submarine  tactical systems to an OA, and the trainers will be compatible with the tactical interfaces. This program includes modifications to the functionality of the Periscope Simulator (PSIM) to provide common imaging training for CCS trainers and includes Electronic Surveillance Simulation Software.  Recent tactical CCS change the interfaces for the software updates to the navigation submarine trainers.\n\nSMMTT is also used for SSGN crew certification prior to crew flyaway for crew swapout.  The use of Open Architecture (OA) trainer systems allows for the continuous growth of functional flexibility ultimately leading to employment training conducted for any submarine combat system.          .\nLegacy SMMTT supports SSBN Crew Certification and predeployment training as required by the Type Commander.  LSMMTT also supports SSNs that have not been modernized in the TI\/APB process including SSN 774 class submarines.  LSMMTT is a combination of tactical combat controls in sonar systems driven by simulation\/stimulation devices and leverages additional trainer simulation\/auxiliary ship systems.  \n\nFY16 procures 4 items:  Procures one SSBN SMMTT Mod EDM, one SMMTT EPM updates to match the latest Fleet tactical build for SSNs and unique sensors; procures two SMMTT kit upgrades to appropriate APB and TI.\n\n[P5 \/ TS004 Surface Training Device Mods]: This line provides funds to procure, modify and upgrade trainers to include Aegis Weapon Systems, Aegis Ashore, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), DDG 1000, Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), Navy Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA), and other Surface Warfare related Training Programs; Navigation, Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E),  combat systems, engineering, damage control and amphibious warfare individual and team Technical Training Equipment, Training Devices, Training Unique Equipment and Training systems. Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan (SEWTP). Additionally, funds support ship on-board training curriculum for the purpose of maintaining perishable operator and maintenance skills.\n\n[P5 \/ Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT)]: Combined Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)\/Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) Trainer (CIAT): From the Aegis Weapon System\/SPY Radar Readiness Task Force, Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) sponsored Fleet Integrated Air and Missile Defense and Anti-Submarine Warfare Improvement Programs, Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA), and C5I training requirements documents, one of the areas identified for long term investment was the requirement for a high fidelity integrated air and missile defense and anti-submarine warfare training capability. Due to the cost prohibitive realities associated with modifying onboard high fidelity training systems, which currently meet only 60% of the CNO requirement for ship training systems to be commensurate with tactical system capability, this shore-based, high fidelity trainer is being procured. The CIAT will field in the Fleet Concentration Areas of San Diego and Norfolk in support of program of record Advanced Warfare Training (AWT). The effort began in FY 14 and supports procurement and installation of two systems across the FYDP.  Installations will occur in San Diego and Norfolk.  Funds also include costs associated with tactical and other software licensing, Information Assurance, computer program corrections and sustainment to ensure alignment with DON CIO Cyber requirements and ship tactical modernization.\n\n[P5 \/ Navy Training System Plan (NTSP TTE\/TD Mods)]: Funds surface and expeditionary training systems in multiple school houses in accordance with the results of CNO directed and OPNAV and Fleet sponsored studies, NTSP updates, and Technical Training Audits. One of the key items identified in the Fleet Review Panel of Surface Force Readiness, LPD 17 Class Wholeness Task Force, (Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Readiness Task Force, Navigation Wholeness Study, Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV)-sponsored Surface Engineering Training Wholeness Review, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Front End Analysis (FEA), DDG 1000 wholeness review, and LHD 8\/ LHA 6 Training Requirements Planning and Programming (TRPPM) analysis done by the Surface Warfare Enterprise was the outdated or lack of training equipment in the schoolhouses.  Based on this analysis, funding supports requirements identified in Navy Training System Plan updates and Technical Training Course Audits. This investment will be for the procurement and installation of Training Equipment at Learning Centers to keep training courses in alignment with current configuration of equipment in the fleet.

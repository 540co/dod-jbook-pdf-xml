            "val": "The High Mobility Engineer Excavator Type I (HMEE-I) is a non-developmental item (NDI). The HMEE-I enables Airborne, Construction and Combat Engineer units with the capabilities necessary to conduct light earthmoving, loading and excavation throughout the area of operations in support of airfield and road repair\/construction, preparation of bridge sites, base camp\/facility sustainment to executing survivability and major construction tasks. Self-deployable, the HMEE-I is used to repair Lines of Communication resulting in increased force mobility, maneuverability, deploy ability, and sustainability. It is capable of traveling up to 60 mph on primary roads, 25 mph on secondary roads, and maintains pace with the Army's current and future combat systems. The minimum monthly sustaining rate for the HMEE-I is six systems per month. The High Mobility Engineer Excavator (Airborne) (HMEE (A)) is an armored, slightly modified HMEE-I that is air-droppable from a C-17 aircraft. The HMEE (A) provides the same excavation and high travel speed (60 mph) capabilities as the HMEE-I. The HMEE (A) will be fielded to Engineer Support Companies and Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) in Airborne units. \n\nThe HMEE-I is also the host platform for the Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS) enabling the remote detection and limited IED neutralization along routes. The intent is for HMEE-I to incorporate Electrical Over Hydraulic (EoH) upgrades through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) which enables remote operations and semi-autonomy of the HMEE. This upgrade would require a revision to the Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM). \n\nThe High Mobility Engineer Excavator Type III (HMEE-III) is a Backhoe Loader (BHL) which is a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) backhoe loader with minor military modifications.  The BHL provides the capability to execute general construction missions in the areas of road building, airfield construction, repair and improve road systems, trails and bridges. The BHL also has the capability to accept a Crew Protection Kit in the form of a replaceable armored cab for contingency operations. The BHL is capable of driving up to 25 MPH on improved roads and 7 MPH off-road. The BHL is transported in the air via C-130, C-5, or C-17 aircraft, or across the highway with M916\/M870 and M915\/M172 truck\/trailer combination organic to the unit. The BHL is fielded to Horizontal and Vertical Construction Companies, the Army training base, and other Non-Engineer Units.  \n\nThe Army Acquisition Objective is: 1,804 (HMEE-I: 1,122\/HMEE-III: 682)."

The EoH upgrade increases the unit cost of the vehicle.\n\nThis program has no FY 2021 Base procurement funding.\n\nNote: FY 2019 quantity of 130 is incorrect due to systematic error. The correct quantity of 134 in the P5, P5a, and P21 reflects actual systems procured.  FY 2020 quantity of 57 is incorrect due to systematic error. The correct quantity of 55 reflects true programmatic planning. \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the Active and Reserve Components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

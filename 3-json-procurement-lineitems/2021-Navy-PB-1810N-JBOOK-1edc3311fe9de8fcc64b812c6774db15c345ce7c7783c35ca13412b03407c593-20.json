Visual augmentation systems (VAS) equipment includes but is not limited to EO\/IR sensors, night vision goggles, weapon laser range finders, optics and illuminators. This funding supports both Navy SEALs and Navy Support personnel and are an NSW core mission requirements essential to readiness and battlefield effectiveness of NSW against both global terrorist organizations as well as near-peer competitors.\n\n[P40A \/ SSBN WATERFRONT RESTRICTED AREA SECURITY (WRAS)]: This category provides for the security equipment required to guard and protect the TRIDENT II (D5) missile while the missile is in storage, being handled, or in a movement convoy to and from the waterfront at the Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) in Kings Bay, GA and the Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (SWFPAC) in Bangor, WA. Funding supports the Waterfront Restricted Area and Limited Area Electronic Security Systems (ESS) installations and refreshes, Vehicle Barriers, the Command, Control, Communication, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) system that provides security system, communication network, computers, security force command and control function as well as the Water Detection System and other equipment necessary to meet Nuclear Security requirements per DOD S-5210.41M (Nuclear Weapons Security Manual).\n\n$7.640M decrease in FY21 is due to the completion of the procurement of 6 harbor security boats.  FY21 efforts include Perimeter Intrusion and Detection Assessment System (PIDAS) installation and a refresh of the Limited Area Electronic Security System (ESS) to address obsolete components and to maintain service life. Additional efforts include updates to the Swimmer Interdiction Systems, which are elements of the Waterfront Security System (WSS) consisting of marine mammals and personnel that provide deterrence, detection and interdiction of surface and subsurface threats to SSBNs moored in port.\n\n[P40A \/ VISUAL AUGMENTATION SYSTEMS (VAS)]: In order to accelerate future capabilities procured and fielded to Naval forces the Visual Augmentation Systems (VAS) Family of Systems (FoS) program will: Drive standardization across the VAS FoS; Enable Fleet learning and experimentation via industry involvement and capability demonstrations; Transition mature technologies from the Science and Technology communities and industry that are aligned to Navy priorities. The VAS program will leverage the military research community, other DoD programs, academia and commercial industry technology development efforts in the key electro-optics technology areas of: active, passive, multi-domain imaging sensors, laser systems, display systems, optics, image processing and algorithms. VAS is necessary to allow the Expeditionary force to maintain situational awareness in degraded visual environments, to obtain and maintain battlefield dominance during missions to Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage and Assess (F2T2EA) enemy combatants and avoid accidental engagement of noncombatants while maintaining the greatest possible distance from threats.\n\nFY21 Plans:\n100 Visual Augmentation Module Portable Imager Recorder-Expeditionary (VAMPIRE) @ $85K EA\n180 AN\/PVS-31B Night Vision Goggles @ $9K EA\n180 AN\/PVS-31B Battery Packs @ $600 EA\n\n[P40A \/ ANTI-TERRORISM AFLOAT (ATA) EQUIPAGE]: Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection (AT\/FP) Physical Security Equipment (PSE) material is a compilation of specific security and AT related items aligned with Chief of Naval Operations (CNO's) objective for operation of watch standers pier side, at perimeter posts, and underway to assist shipboard security forces in thwarting potential terrorist attacks. Vessel Boarding Search and Seizure (VBSS) material enables surface forces to reach full Maritime Interception Operations (MIO) capability including interception, boarding, searching, diverting and \/or seizing suspect vessels. \n\nFY21 Plans:\n3,800 Maritime Armor Systems (MAS) @ ~$770 EA\n3,800 Maritime Buoyant Plates (MBP) @ ~$550 EA\n3,250 Maritime Security Helmets (MSH) @ ~$550 EA\n1,500 Lightweight Plates (LWP) @ ~$630 EA\n\nMAS and MBP provide comprehensive ballistic protection in an inherently buoyant system to increase survivability of sailors during shipboard ATFP, exposed battle station, and VBSS missions. MSH provides comprehensive ballistic and blunt impact head protection in a boltless, highly adjustable helmet that is 10% lighter than legacy Army and USMC systems. LWP reduces sailor weight burden without sacrificing ballistic protection in higher threat environments.\n\n[P40A \/ BIOMETRICS]: Funding will provide biometrics capability to the Fleet surface ships for Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) Enhanced Maritime Interception Operations (EMIO) by providing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capability to download fused terrorism intelligence.

NSW's past experience in these environments has demonstrated that the supply chain is lengthened beyond its ability to replace vital system parts in a timely manner.  A Centralized PUK will be deployed to support multiple NSW Puma Operational teams from a centralized hub.  Unlike a remote PUK, the centralized PUK will enable support for multiple operational elements for up to 6 months.  As these support multiple teams, a more robust supply of parts is necessary as Naval supply chains cannot provide parts support quickly enough to remote locations ensure combat effectiveness of invaluable tactical ISR support.",

The EP-3E is a land based, long range aircraft with electronic intercept devices for detection and tracking of enemy Radio Detection and Ranging and communications.\n\nIn Operational, Safety and Improvement Program (OSIP) 11-01, the Joint Airborne Signal Intelligence Architecture Modification Common Configuration (JCC) obsolescence Engineering Change Orders (ECO)improves operational capability and aircrew productivity by updating the Electronic Support Measures systems, applying state-of-the-art signal exploitation\/processing\/display techniques, off-board classified communication, and expanding special signal processing capability.  OSIP 14-05 responds to the current, immediate demand for information operations capabilities on the EP-3E in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).\n\nResearch and Development is funded with National Security Agency (NSA) Military Intelligence Program (MIP) funds.  This OSIP provides the procurement tail for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds from the Navy's Advanced Signal Recognition line (Program Element 0305206N).  The NSA RDT&E line for the Navy Airborne Sensor System Improvements funds sensor improvements with application for the EP-3E.  MIP RDT&E funds are responsible for the development and acquisition of EP-3E sensors, data links, data relays and ground stations to achieve and maintain interoperability with Defense-wide airborne reconnaissance assets.  Active Primary Aircraft Authorization inventory is 12. Funds budgeted in FY2016-FY2021 are to continue EP-3E Joint Airborne Signal Intelligence Architecture Modification Common Configuration Program.  The EP-3E has an average age of 38.5 years."

This Line Item is comprised of two programs: the Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).    \n\nUSSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive, high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm's way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF)."

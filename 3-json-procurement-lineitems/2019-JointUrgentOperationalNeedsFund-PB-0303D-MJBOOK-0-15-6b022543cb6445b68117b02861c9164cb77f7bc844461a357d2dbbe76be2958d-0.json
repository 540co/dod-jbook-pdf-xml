            "val": "The Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF) provides the Secretary of Defense with essential agility to quickly respond to Warfighter urgent operational needs that if left unresolved will result in, or have already resulted in, loss of life and\/or critical mission failure to United States (U.S.) forces in contingency operations, world-wide.  Asymmetric and unforeseen threats will continue to pose dangerous challenges to the U.S. forces around the globe.  Although Prior Approval reprogramming actions are a robust tool, they add time to the resourcing process which delays initiation of immediate action to address an urgent operational need.  Understanding this, the Congress has provided the Department with Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) which allows for the very rapid acquisition of required materiel in meeting Warfighter requirements.  However, because RAA lacks an appropriation from which to draw funds, a funding offset must be identified before any resourcing activity can execute, again delaying resolution of critical operational needs.  The Department has increased its use of RAA for the past four years, totaling over $700 million in funding authority to expedite solutions to urgent Warfighter requirements.  This experience indicates a continuing need for  a level of immediate, flexible funding to accompany current authorities  The requested funding of the JUONF would be used to support RAA requirements and would enable immediate initiation of action to resolve urgent requirements while the Department completes any reprogramming necessary that will provide the balance of funding needed.  The Department has an effective process in place to validate and prioritize the selective application of this flexible funding from the JUONF.  Judicious use of the JUONF prevents critical mission failures and saves time, money and Warfighter lives.\n\nThe Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF) was established as an account in the Treasury by Title 10, United States Code, Section 2216A.  Amounts in the fund are to be available to the Secretary of Defense for capabilities that are determined by the Secretary, pursuant to the review process required by section 804(b) of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note), to be suitable for rapid fielding in response to urgent operational needs."

Tech refresh of ENFIRE is on a five year cycle and is the replacement of the laptop and selected peripherals. ENFIRE tech refresh kits are comprised of commercial off the shelf equipment. \n\nThe Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (commonly known as ENFIRE) is a digital technical stand off engineering and data collection tool set, designed to perform reconnaissance, obstacle reporting, construction management, and  surveying using precision measuring devices in conjunction with a tablet computer that contains user friendly Geographic Information System (GIS) to auto populate road, bridge, minefield, and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) report forms.  It allows greater accuracy and precision of measurements and faster, automatic information collection and less error-prone dissemination. ENFIRE is Common Joint Mapping Tool Kit (CJMTK) compatible for geospatial interoperability and allows data collection from a distance, minimizing exposure to enemy observation; greatly improving safety to soldiers.\n\nENFIRE incorporates the ability to automatically populate field data on digital forms used for road, bridge, hasty minefield, ford, tunnel and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) reconnaissance\/reporting with relevant information from peripheral devices included in the ENFIRE set. ENFIRE sets are used at the Battalion, Company, Platoon, and Squad levels as a means to facilitate rapid collection and dissemination of information to commanders in the field.   Information may be disseminated via the Battle Command Common Services to other ENFIRE sets and to other Mission Command (MC) and Intelligence systems. ENFIRE also has broad area application as a common computing platform for the engineer platoon; with plans to incorporate research and development efforts that have application across Military and General Engineering disciplines.\n\nThe long distance laser range finder allows soldiers to quickly and accurately determine a target's bearing and distance from the users' location at a significant standoff range.   Used in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver and ArcMap software, ENFIRE users are able to create overlays of bridges, roads, hasty minefields, and IEDs on digital maps as they collect information related to these targets.   Using the video camcorder and digital scanner, ENFIRE users can also collect picture and scanned image files that can be associated with bridge, road, hasty minefield and IED information for reporting purposes. Reports can be generated in hard or soft copy for rapid dissemination.\n\nENFIRE Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) = 2,864\n\nENFIRE Hardware and Software are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) procurements"

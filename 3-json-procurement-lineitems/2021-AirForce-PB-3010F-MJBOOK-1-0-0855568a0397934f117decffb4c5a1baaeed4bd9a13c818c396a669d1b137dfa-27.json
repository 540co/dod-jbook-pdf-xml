            "val": "This line item funds aircraft modernization efforts for two (2) VC-25A presidential support aircraft, a commercial derivative of the commercial Boeing 747-200. The aircraft are commonly referred to as \"Air Force One.\" The aircraft were purchased in FY87, modified by Boeing to meet presidential requirements, and delivered in FY91. These on-going modifications are to extend the service life until the VC-25B aircraft are fielded in the 2024 timeframe.\n\nVC-25 Block Upgrades ensure aircraft viability until the VC-25B program reaches full operational capability. The upgrades include installing protected satellite communications, weather radar, digital\/voice data systems, and network capabilities. Service bulletins and low cost modifications are necessary for continuing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness certification while improving flight safety, reliability, and maintainability. This funding may include emerging modification requirements to support Program Management Advisors (PMA), Administrative and Advisroy support (A&AS), system integration lab, trainers, equipment, other government costs (OGC), and Senior Leader Communications System modernization efforts.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Solutions (DMSMS) issues.\n\nStarting in FY21 VC-25A will begin a modification to the Senior Leader Command Control Communication System (SLC3S).\n\nCongressional language established a VC-25A retirement date of 31 Dec 2025. Pursuant to the provisions of 10 U .S.C. 2244a, SecAF determined the following capabilities modifications are the national security interest of the United States: \n(a) ADS-B Out\/Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) FAA mandate (b) Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Solutions (DMSMS), and (c) Communications Management System (CMS) Modernization - VIPSAM Protected SATCOM (VPS), Presidential Information Technology Communication (PITC) Wi-Fi and Commercial Internet, Bandwidth Aggregation, Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and High Definition Video Teleconference (HDVTC)."

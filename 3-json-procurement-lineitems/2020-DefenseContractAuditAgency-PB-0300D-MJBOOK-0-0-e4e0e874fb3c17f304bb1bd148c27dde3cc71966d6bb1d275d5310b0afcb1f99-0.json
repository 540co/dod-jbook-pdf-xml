            "val": "These funds provide for the purchase of the latest technologically advanced electronic information technology equipment to support DCAA's contract audit mission.  In order to efficiently perform our audit reviews, it is essential that DCAA auditors be provided with equipment and software that are compatible with defense contractors' information technology systems, that provide access to the Agency's Management Information System and to the Internet for researching audit issues, and that provide the capability to securely electronically transmit and receive audit documents.  In addition, up-to-date equipment is needed to satisfy the hardware\/software\/communication requirements for Information Assurance compliance as well as to interface with a variety of DoD standard systems such as:  Defense Business Management System (DBMS), Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS), Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS), Defense Travel System (DTS), Program Budget and Accounting System (PBAS), and the Standard Procurement System (SPS).  Procurement funds will be applied to the continued upgrading of DCAA's Integrated Information Network automation efforts.\n\nFY 2018\nDCAA Integrated Information Network. ($1.475 million) In FY 2018, funding in the amount of $700,000 is required to support the Agency's communication projects involving access to DoD standard systems and to the Internet and World Wide Web. Funding in the amount of $775,000 is required for the replacement of local area network servers that have reached the end of their useful systems life and storage to meet DoD requirements. The components will replace those that are technologically obsolete and no longer capable of running current applications software or that are non-operational and the cost to repair exceeds the cost to replace.\n\nFY 2019\nDCAA Integrated Information Network. ($2.542 million) In FY 2019, funding in the amount of $1,089,000 is required to continue the scheduled procurement of caseware licensing for the software used by DCAA to aid in the creation and building of the audits DCAA produces. Funding in the amount of $1,453,000 is required to support the life-cycle replacement of technologically obsolete infrastructure.\n\nFY 2020\nStarting in FY 2020, funds for the purchase of equipment have been transferred to DCAA's O&M line."

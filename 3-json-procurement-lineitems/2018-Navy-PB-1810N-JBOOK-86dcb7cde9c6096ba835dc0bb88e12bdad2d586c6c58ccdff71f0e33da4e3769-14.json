Imaging Budget Line Item 0831 and Electronic Warfare Budget Line Item 2560 (including Radar) OPN funds will consolidate under BLI 0840 in FY17 and out.\n\n(U) The Submarine Support Equipment Program (SSEP) was established to develop and support systems which provide the capability to exploit signal intercepts for tactical support and early warning of threat sensors. The Electronic Warfare Support (ES) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Serial. No. 570-77-00 dated 20 Dec. 2000, established funding to procure AN\/BLQ-10 Electronic Warfare Support and Improved Communication Acquisition\/Direction Finding (ICADF) systems to provide a modern ES capability to LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, and SSGN Class submarines. Funds procure AN\/BLQ-10B(V) Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), Pre-Production Units (PPU) and augmentation systems for ES Modernization upgrades for all submarine platforms. Funds also procure modification kits for the AN\/BLQ-10(V) ES System, VIRGINIA Class ES Modernization upgrades, Reliability & Maintainability, obsolescence and Operational Field Change Kits for the legacy AN\/WLR-8(V)2 ESM system, and the legacy AN\/BRD-7 direction finding system. Funds buy unique equipment in limited quantities that are maintained in a pool and rotated among attack submarines as dictated by scheduled operations and to provide specific capability improvements to major SSN sensor systems. \n\nML003 - SSEP special support equipment allows the procurement of special purpose test equipment utilized by the Type Commander Groom Teams.  Exact quantities vary from year to year based on Fleet requirements.\n\nML005 - Procures Legacy Submarine Electronic Surveillance Measures (SubESM) AN\/BRD-7 Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) obsolescence and operational Field Change Kits, e.g., Analog relay replacement, antenna cabling replacement, related Hull, Mechanical & Electrical (H,M&E) sail components and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and technical data.\n\nML007 - Procures the ICADF communications direction finding system below deck units for installation on LOS ANGELES and SEAWOLF Class submarines.\n\nML008 - Procures the ICADF Multi-Function Modular Mast (MMM) Antenna for installation on LOS ANGELES Class submarines. Procures spare MMMs to support fleet replacement in the event of catastrophic failure.\n\nML009 - Procures Capability Insertions for installation on LOS ANGELES, SSGN, and SEAWOLF Class submarines that provide incremental improvements to the AN\/BLQ-10(V) baseline system for improved capability against new threats, to reduce size, procurement costs, power requirements and maintenance, while increasing system availability. Includes: Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR)\/Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) upgrade, Info Assurance (IA)\/Solaris upgrade, Exterior Communication System (ECS) Point to Point upgrade, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) Radar Receiver, and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and technical data.\n\nML010 - Procures Technical Insertions (TI) for installation on LOS ANGELES, SSGN, SEAWOLF, and VIRGINIA Class submarines that provide updates to the AN\/BLQ-10(V) configuration baseline which incorporate current Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) processing technology and software to account for obsolescence avoidance, and Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) and technical data. Hardware builds include supporting platform level Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) interfaces. TI upgrade kits are procured under various configurations in each fiscal year including required NRE for TI-12, TI-14, TI-16, and TI-18.\n\nML011 -Procures Legacy Submarine Electronic Surveillance Measures (SubESM) including AN\/WLR-8 Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) Field Change Kits and other materials for Obsolescence Mitigation, e.g., Digital Display Unit (DDU) obsolescence upgrade, Solid State Memory, Heat Dissipation improvement, related H,M&E sail components and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and technical data.\n\nML015 - Procures the AN\/BLQ-10(V)2\/3\/4 ES System for installation on LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, and SSGN Class submarines.\n\nML017 - Procures AN\/BLQ-10(V) and ICADF subsystem Product Improvement Field Change Kits including: emergent Engineering Changes, SIGINT carry-on equipment racks, SWFTS upgrades and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) and technical data. Provide AN\/BLQ-10 intermediate level repairs, changes and maintenance activities and associated materials that improve the overall Reliability, Maintainability and Availability of fielded SubESM systems.  Procures maintenance and sustainment efforts for AN\/BLQ-10 active, deploying fleet assets. Increased funding starting FY16 provided to address growing obsolescence and reliability issues as basic AN\/BLQ-10 system continues to age.\n\nML018 - Funds procure ES Modernization upgrades to the VIRGINIA Class AN\/BLQ-10(V)1 ES System including Photonics ES Product Improvement (PEPI-3), PATRIOT Phase B range finder and Technical Insertions (TI).\n\nML019 - Procures ESM spares to provide Ready for Issue (RFI) assets to maintain system operational availability. \n\nML020 - Funds procure AN\/BLQ-10B(V) Non-Reoccurring Engineering (NRE) and modernization kits for ES Modernization upgrades on all SSN\/SSGN platforms.  OPNAV direction provided for Next Generation EW Digital Submarine Electronic Warfare System Serial N97\/12U144403 dated 17 June 12. The AN\/BLQ-10B(V) efforts will transform the current AN\/BLQ-10(V) system to a digital hardware system that will enable a sustainable, cost effective, software application based modernization process for the rapid fielding of required capabilities to address changing and emerging threats in the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum. AN\/BLQ-10B(V) incorporates a five layered approach including: RF, Digitizing, Interface, Processing, and Display.  These layers serve as building blocks to the AN\/BLQ-10(V) Modular, Open system, Scalable Architecture (MOSA) approach.\n\nML021 - Procure BPS 15\/16 Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) Field Change Kits and other materials for Obsolescence Mitigation. Provide in-service and systems engineering, logistics, material, configuration management, quality assurance, installation and test certification support only for the Submarine Surface Navigation (AN\/BPS-15\/16) Radar.  Also provides for interface with the conjoined Voyage Management System (VMS) and Electronic Chart & Display Information System - Navy (ECDIS-N). BPS 15\/16 funding transferred as zero sum adjustment from BLI 0670 where these requirements were previously supported. Transfer done to provide more focused, submarine centric oversight of these ship safety required systems.\n\nML830 - Production Engineering funds provide the following functions:  value engineering; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; production configuration control; maintenance engineering efforts designed and incorporated into the production manufacturing process, and other related engineering functions that are integral to all production ES Systems and upgrades.\n\nML927 - Provides for the Installation of Equipment including Fleet Modernization Program Installations for shipboard systems.\n\nML4M7 - Provides for the Installation of non-Fleet Modernization Program Equipment."

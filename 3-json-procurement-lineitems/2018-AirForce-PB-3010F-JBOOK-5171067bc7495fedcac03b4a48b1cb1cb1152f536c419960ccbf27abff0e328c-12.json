            "val": "The four-engine C-5 carries outsized and heavy cargo (tanks, helicopters, etc.) between main operating bases.  Additionally, the aircraft is capable of carrying 73 troops and 36 standard 463-L pallets. \n\nThe C-5 fleet was delivered to the Air Force from 1969 to 1989.  Initial service life for the aircraft was 30,000 flight hours.  Air Force plans to retire the C-5A fleet of 59 aircraft.  That process began in FY11 and 55 of those aircraft were retired as of 1 May 2017.\n\nThere are 56 C-5A\/B\/C\/M aircraft in the Air Force fleet as of 1 May 2017.  Four of that fleet are C-5 A-models, which are for support of Westover Air Reserve Base (AFRC) of operational\/maintenance requirements until the unit begins receipt of its eight C-5M aircraft in May 2017.  The four C-5As will be retired in CY2017 on a one-for-one basis as the unit receives the C-5M.\n\nAt the end of FY17 when the C-5A aircraft fleet is retired, the Air Force will have a fleet of 47 C-5M aircraft and five C-5B aircraft undergoing modification to the C-5M configuration.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401119F.  RERP incurred a schedule re-baseline in FY14 without a corresponding re-baseline in funding profile.  The program will have 5 aircraft still in final stages of production in FY18 and therefore has requirements for fuel for test flights, government furnished property, PMA and final transition\/shutdown activities.  In FY18, C-5 RERP will be considered a New Start as the last year of funding was FY15."

            "val": "This line item is to replace and modernize common and peculiar automatic test system and automatic test equipment. Some of the items include hardware production for Common Aircraft Portable Reprogrammable Equipment and Cruise Missile Automatic Test Systems. \n\nCommon Aircraft Portable Reprogrammable Equipment (CAPRE): The CAPRE replaces the Digital Computer Systems and 11 Program Loader Verifiers devices in organizational  and intermediate level shops. CAPRE reprograms aircraft computer software, updates threat data in electronic warfare pods, perform aircraft diagnostic troubleshooting and support automated technical orders. CAPRE consists of a laptop, cables, interface modules, software and Aircraft Adapter Groups (AAG). The CAPRE supports the following weapons systems A-10, B-1, B-52, C-5, C-17, C-130, CV-22, F-15, F-16, H-60 and KC-46. CAPREs architecture and design allows it to add weapons systems to increase the commonality of the system \n\nCruise Missile Automatic Test System (CM-ATS): CM-ATS is a nuclear certified intermediate level tester that support the B-2 and B-52 Weapons systems. The system was originally designed in the 1970's and the final system was delivered in 1984. The current system has several obsolete items and requires a full fleet replacement of these items to support the tester until 2030.\n\nFunding in this exhibit contained in PEC: 0701212F."

The M4 Carbine Modification Program provides combat optics, a Close Quarters Battle Kit (CQBK), an Enhanced Performance Magazine (EPM), 5.56mm suppressor, color modifications, and M4 to M4A1 carbine upgrade kits. The Improved Weapons Cleaning Kit (IWCK) contains necessary items to conduct a thorough and efficient cleaning of both weapon and optic, and has been reconfigured into: Individual Kit and Team Kit. The 5.56 Enhanced Performance Magazine (EPM) decreases weapon wear, significantly increases reliability, durability, readiness and maintains terminal performance of the M4 and M16 family of weapons. The 5.56mm suppressor and color modifications reduce the sound and visual signatures of the M4\/M4A1 carbine as well as increase the difficulty of enemy forces to easily distinguish the Close Combat Force (CFT) and other units. The M4 Product Improvement Program converts all fielded M4 Carbines to M4A1 Carbine configuration to include the M4A1 heavy barrel assembly and full auto trigger mechanism and adding new ambidextrous fire control selector assembly."

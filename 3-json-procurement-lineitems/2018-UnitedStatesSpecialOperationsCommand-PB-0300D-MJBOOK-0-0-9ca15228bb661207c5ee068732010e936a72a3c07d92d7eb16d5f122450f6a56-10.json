The MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) line item funds the acquisition and support of Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weaponization, and modifications on MQ-1 UAVs, ground control stations, and training systems as part of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical Program. USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing operations against terrorist networks. As the combatant command executing these operations, USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Target Acquisition, and Strike."

These vehicles were originally procured in response to Operational Needs Statements, Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements, and Universal Urgent Needs Statements to meet wartime requirements to mitigate the effects of Improvised Explosive Devices, underbody mines, rocket propelled grenades, and small arms threats. The Army reduced the MRAP enduring requirement from 8,585 vehicles to 8,222 vehicles in Feb 2016.  All other MRAP variants will be divested.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

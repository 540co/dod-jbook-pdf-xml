In addition, these vehicles respond to forest fires, train and automobile accidents, and hazardous material incidents.  These vehicles are essential to all military installations and to many local communities for the preservation of life and property.\n\nNon-tactical Fire Trucks are of standard commercial design with only slight modifications.  Examples include Structural Pumpers, Ladder Trucks, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)\/Rescue Trucks, Brush Tanker, Airfield Crash Trucks, and Mobile Water Supply fire trucks.  These trucks are needed by all the Installation Management Command (IMCOM) regions, as well as by other Army Commands and units.  The Army's Fire Fighting Vehicles are essential to all military installations and to many local communities for preservation of life and property.  The Army fire fighting vehicles not only respond to fires on installations and within local communities, but also to forest fires, aircraft, train, automobile accidents and hazardous material incidents.  Procurements are made to fill shortages or to replace fire trucks that have reached over-aged or unserviceable condition.

A total of 42 Non-Tactical Fire Trucks are needed to replace over-aged trucks and fill existing shortages.  Many over age trucks are unsafe, unable to respond to fire calls and uneconomical to repair.  These trucks are needed by all the Installation Management Command (IMCOM) Regions: Atlantic, Central, Pacific, Korea and Europe, as well as other Army Commands and reporting Units.  Examples include Structural Pumpers, Ladder Trucks, Airfield Crash Trucks, and Mobile Water Supply fire trucks.  \n\nThe increase in budget for FY 2018 represents a plan to replace a higher quantity of fire trucks each year, beginning in FY 2018, in order to lower the average age of the Army fire truck fleet for continued improvement in fire and emergency response capabilities.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

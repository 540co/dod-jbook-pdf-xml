Replenishment spares consist of repairable components, assemblies and subassemblies required for follow-on sustainment of end items.  Munitions replenishment spare levels are based on item-specific failure\/demand driven computations.\n\nProvide Area Attack telemetry kit Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) analysis for Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD). Contractor will perform engineering study, installation, delivery and testing for WCMD weapons with telemetry kits.\n\nFunds may be used to address production Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages\/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier\/parts replacement, to include electronic components used commercially and in short supply, and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.\n\nPE associated with this P-1 Line is 0208030F."

Initial or Replenishment spares and repair parts are necessary for the following Air Force (PAAF) P-1 end items: Rockets, Cartridges, Practice Bombs, General Purpose Bombs, Cartridge Actuated Devices\/Propellant Actuated Devices (CAD\/PAD), Explosive Ordinance Disposal, Flares, and Fuzes.   \n\nThe Air Force procures munitions to maintain appropriate quantities in the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Munitions and test and training stockpiles. Active, Guard and Reserve components draw from the WRM stockpiles as required and receive test and training allocations annually based on current-year requirements."

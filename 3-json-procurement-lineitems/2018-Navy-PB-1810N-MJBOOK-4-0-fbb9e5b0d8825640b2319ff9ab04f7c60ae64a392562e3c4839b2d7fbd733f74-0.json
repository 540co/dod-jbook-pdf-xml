            "val": "This budget line item funds procurement of passenger-carrying vehicles consisting of buses, automobiles, ambulances, and various utility and carryall trucks up to 9200 lbs. Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). These vehicles are utilized by Naval operating forces and shore activities for essential transportation of personnel in the execution of official Navy business. Funding in this line also supports the Joint POW\/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC).\n\nBuses procured are 20 to 60 passenger school buses, shuttle buses, intercity buses, and ambulance buses, which provide the most cost effective means to transport groups of people between various locations. Buses are used to transport sailors\/airmen and reserve personnel for flight\/ship logistic related assignments, mandatory military training and exercises, and for transportation of personnel between administrative areas, ships\/airfields, and industrial areas on a daily basis (both scheduled and intermittent).\n\nAutomobiles are used to transport small groups of personnel, on and off base, for various work related activities. Law enforcement automobiles provide essential transportation services to insure optimum responsiveness in support of DOD intelligence and base security missions. They are used in Naval intelligence, investigative and surveillance operations, security patrols, and other law enforcement activities.\n\nAmbulances are used by the Medical Corps at Navy hospitals, clinics, and by Naval Expeditionary Medical Command Units. Modular ambulances are used for emergency transport of personnel where emergency medical services are provided in route. Field ambulances provide the same emergency service, but are four-wheel drive to access remote sites in support of field units. Patient transport ambulances are used for transporting stabilized patients to specialized care\/other medical facilities. Ambulance conversion buses are used to move mixed loads of ambulatory and\/or stretcher-borne patients.\n\nMaintenance\/utility trucks are utilized to transport tools, supplies, materials, and equipment necessary for maintenance personnel performing facility maintenance at shore facilities. Carryalls are used for transporting sailors, flight crews, maintenance, and civilian personnel to work sites or for other mission related activities."

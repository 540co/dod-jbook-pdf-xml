        "Description": {
            "val": "The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997), and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term \"bandwidth gap\" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.\n\nWGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3.  These satellites were successfully launched on 10 October 2007, 3 April 2009, and 5 December  2009, respectively.   \n\nWGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites are designed with slight modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  Satellite 4 was successfully launched on 19 January 2012.  Satellite 5 was successfully launched on 24 May 2013.\n\nA United States-Australia WGS partnership was codified in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 14 November 2007.  Australia provides funds needed to buy Space Vehicle-6 (SV-6) in exchange for access to constellation-wide (SVs 1-6) resources.  Satellite 6 was successfully launched on 7 August 2013.  SV-6 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.\n\nWGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) consists of satellites 7-10. The WGS procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for the WGS B2FO satellites.   \n\nA multilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand was codified in an MOU in January 2012.  The United States contributions include existing and programmed infrastructure, to include the acquisition, launch, operations, and sustainment costs of WGS 1-8, and the launch, operations, and sustainment of SV-9.  Other Partners' contributions fund SV-9 acquisition and support activities.  Each Partner provides funds needed to buy SV-9 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (SVs 1-9) resources commensurate with its level of contribution.  SV-9 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.\n\nWGS-7 was successfully launched on 23 July 2015. WGS-8 was successfully launched on 7 December 2016. WGS-9 was successfully launched on 18 March 2017. WGS-10 will be launched in FY19.\n\nDiscussions for potential future partnerships regarding the WGS program continue in support of National Space Policy and improved operational efficiency.\n\nThe Air Force has been working to identify opportunities for more affordable, efficient commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) business arrangements.  Specifically, the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications Systems (MILSATCOM) Directorate has developed a five phase COMSATCOM pathfinder investment strategy to burn down risk targeting affordability and performance. \n\nIn an FY2014 effort to study SATCOM capabilities to support Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirements, the WGS program invested $8.0M in what is known as COMSATCOM Pathfinder #1.  In Pathfinder #1, on-orbit commercial Ku-band transponders were purchased to support AFRICOM while demonstrating risk mitigation steps toward future innovative, affordable procurement of long term COMSATCOM capabilities. \n\nIn FY2016, Congress added $26.0M for the COMSATCOM Pathfinder effort.  Pathfinder #2 will purchase commercial pre-launch transponders that will include protection features.\n \nWith FY2017 funding, the Air Force will execute Pathfinder #3.  Pathfinder #3 builds on the Pathfinder #2 scope and incorporates access to commercial ground stations.  The current plan for Pathfinder #3 is to use an Other Transactions Authority (OTA) contract to purchase commercial transponders and ground station hardware at a commercial site.  Under the OTA, the government and contractor team will demonstrate the ability to flexibly reassign bandwidth between multiple users and work cooperatively to refine that process over a period of five years. The current interpretation of the OTA statutes within the Air Force indicates that this type of OTA requires RDT&E funds.  Congress realigned $30M FY17 from SPAF to RDT&E for Pathfinder #3. \n\nIn FY2018-2019, the Air Force programmed funds for Pathfinders #4-5.  The Pathfinder #4 acquisition strategy is being developed to ensure it will continue to address portions of the four goals in FY15 and one goal from FY16 that were outlined in FY15 & FY16 NDAAs. These goals were initiated in the first three Pathfinders programs. They are 1 - Cost Effective and Strategic Method to Acquire COMSATCOM; 2- Incentivize Private-sector Participation and Investment; 3- Provide Flexible (Surge) Capacity; 4- Enable Cost Accounting and Control; 5- Demonstrate potential to achieve \u2018Order-of-Magnitude' improvements in COMSATCOM capability. Pathfinder #5 in conjunction with Pilot Phase #3 will demonstrate the use of commercial high throughput\/capacity satellites (HTS\/HCS). This demonstration will meet the objective of the \"order of magnitude goal (#5) as stated above.  Pathfinder #5 will need to develop, in conjunction with Pilot Phase #2 and Pilot Phase #3, the necessary interfaces for USG terminals to access the high throughput satellite capability (data packets - \"bits).  Pathfinder #5 will shift from only procuring bits to developing, integrating and demonstrating an architecture that enables the terminals to achieve \"order of magnitude improvements only available through the use of bits.    \n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThe flyaway unit cost is not included on P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.\n\nAs of the FY2016 PB submission, space programs' satellite procurement funding has been re-categorized from Appropriation 3020, Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF), to Appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY2016 and beyond.  Total MPAF\/SPAF procurement funding is $3,265.414M.  Total WGS SV1-SV5 MPAF funds are $1,619.426M.  There are no WGS SV1-SV5 SPAF funds.  Total WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) MPAF\/SPAF funds are $1,645.988M.\n\n    \nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203600F.    \n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 1206433F."

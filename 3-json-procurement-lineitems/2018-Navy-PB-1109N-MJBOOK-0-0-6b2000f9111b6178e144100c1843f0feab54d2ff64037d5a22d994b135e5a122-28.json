DCGS-MC will comply with the Department of Defense (DOD) DCGS Enterprise interoperability and information sharing requirements by migrating select processing, exploitation, analysis, and production capabilities into a single, integrated, net-centric baseline within the Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Enterprise (MCISRE).  This baseline will enable MCISRE analysts to deliver tactically focused, operational and strategic intelligence at the tactical edge throughout all phases of operations and will provide relevant, precise decision support for Joint Task Force (JTF), Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), and subordinate Marine units.  The DoD DCGS Enterprise provides worldwide garrison, and forward projection of tactical ISR capabilities at the JTF level and below.  The DoD DCGS Enterprise enhances intelligence sharing within the Joint Services, the Intelligence Community, and Coalition Forces throughout all phases of operations.  Each individual Military Service DCGS Program of Record provides unique and distinct capabilities to the overall DoD DCGS Enterprise.  DCGS-MC Geospatial Intelligence( DCGS-MC GEOINT) consists of GEOINT Imagery and Topographic Production Capability (TPC), Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG), Enterprise DCGS Integration Backbone Services (EDS), Virtual Imagery Processing - Marine Corps (VIP-MC), Target Material Production (TMP) Full Motion Video - Optical Navigation Exploitation (FMV-ONE), and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) systems.  These capabilities will provide the USMC GEOINT analysts with the capability to process, disseminate, exploit, analyze, and produce intelligence.  Future capabilities and enhancements will be delivered via clearly defined Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).  The specific content of each ECP will be determined by an integrated assessment of user needs, technology readiness, risk mitigation, and affordability."

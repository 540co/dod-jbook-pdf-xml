This is a new start effort.  These procurements include offices, armories, and billeting in enduring locations within countries such as Kuwait, Qatar and U.A.E.  The buildings are needed to provide and\/or replace working and living facilities for troops in the enduring locations.  Without the new buildings, troops would continue to live and work in expeditionary facilities and tents in enduring locations with exceptionally hot climates creating safety and health risks.  Without the ability to replace relocatable buildings that are beyond life cycle, troops would continue to live in buildings that will become unrepairable and expose them to potential electrical dangers.  There are several thousand relocatable buildings within the Operation Spartan Shield (OSS) footprint that will be included in this life cycle program.\n\nFY2020 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $62.654 million procures up to 283 relocatable buildings to replace facilities for the Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) mission and to emplace needed facilities at LSA Danger on Erbil International Airport, Iraq and LSA Union III, Iraq for US personnel in support of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).

            "val": "Funding for this mod in FY15 ($4.7M) and FY16 ($13.7M) was in PE0101213F, M30MLG, MM III Modifications.\n\nThe ICBM Fuze Modernization program will replace the current Mk21\/W87 fuze to meet warfighter requirements to support both Minuteman III (MM III) and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The new fuze will be a form, fit, and functionally equivalent replacement for the legacy Mk21\/W87 and will provide a 30-year design life. The program will support the current force of 400 deployed and 50 non-deployed ICBMs.\n\nThe program will provide needed MM III weapon system modifications, system testing, support equipment, data and training required to accommodate, field, and support the new Mk21 fuze along with the W87 warhead as defined in the AFGSC Requirements Traceability Memo dated 2 December 2013. In addition, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) signed the program's JROC Memorandum validating the operational requirement for the program on 6 December 2016. Currently available Mk21\/W87 fuze quantities do not meet United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements and the legacy fuze is three times beyond its original ten year design life. A replacement Mk21\/W87 fuze is urgently required to meet warfighter requirements and to ensure operational capability. ICBM Fuze Modernization will procure 693 Mk21\/W87 replacement fuzes. Fuzes will be delivered and placed in supply for installation by organizational\/intermediate maintenance on a schedule to be determined by USSTRATCOM and Air Force Global Strike Command.\n\nLife of Program Buy\nThe ICBM Fuze Modernization program will continue acquiring Life-of-Program Buys (LOPB) materials and components through FY19 to support both the Mk21\/W87 and future W78-1 Life Extension Program (LEP). The W78-1 LEP will utilize the same replacement fuze being developed by the ICBM Fuze Modernization program. Executing LOPB for W78-1 LEP ensures this future program can fully leverage the material design, component design, and nuclear certification and qualification activities."

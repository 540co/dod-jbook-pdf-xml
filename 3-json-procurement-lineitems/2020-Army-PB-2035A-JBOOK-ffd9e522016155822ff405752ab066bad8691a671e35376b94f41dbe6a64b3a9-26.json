            "val": "The Field Feeding and Refrigeration program provides equipment to conduct tactical food service operations. Field Feeding is a combat multiplier which improves morale and enhances the Soldier's physical and cognitive capabilities. Associated with food service operations are storage, preparation, serving and cleanup. Equipment items include: field kitchens, food sanitation centers, and refrigerated containers. This program supports the production of the Battlefield Kitchen that will replace the over-age and outdated Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT) as the Army's midsized kitchen.  The Battlefield Kitchen will provide units with a modern, safer, and more operationally and energy efficient capability. It is designed for today's rations and tactical prime movers that meet Army requirements for improved mobility, survivability, and deployability. This program supports production of the Multi Temperature Refrigerated Container System (MTRCS), Assault Kitchen (AK), Containerized Kitchen (CK) and Field Feeding Sanitation Center (FSC). This equipment in conjunction with food service personnel and field rations, comprises the Army Field Feeding System (AFFS) which supports the Army standard of a minimum of one hot prepared meal per day in the field. This program provides a critical capability that supports Army transformation and modularity concept while maintaining readiness through fielding and integration of new equipment. It enhances the field Soldier's well being and reduces requirements for related lift demands, combat zone footprint, and logistical support costs. AAO is as the following:\n\n1. AK = 1527\n2. BK = 1606\n3. MTRCS = 2024\n4. CK = 1033\n5. FSC = 2528"

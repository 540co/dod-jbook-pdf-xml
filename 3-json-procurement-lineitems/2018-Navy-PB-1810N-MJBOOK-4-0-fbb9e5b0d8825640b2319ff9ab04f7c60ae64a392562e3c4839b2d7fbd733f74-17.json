            "val": "Beginning in FY17, funding was consolidated under LI 8101 Training and Education Equipment.\n\nThe U. S. Naval Academy's mission is to ensure the best educated and most qualified junior officers enter the naval service.  The Academy must maintain the highest standards in academic disciplines and supporting infrastructure.  Planned upgrades and replacements are vital in ensuring graduates are technologically prepared to serve in tomorrow's Fleet and Fleet Marine Force while supporting institutional accreditation and competitiveness with peer institutions.\n\nA.  Universal Wireless Telecommunications System - DAS Cellular ($1,585K FY 2016):\nFY 2013 provides upgrades of existing telecommunications system to enhance cellular  coverage within the historic Bancroft Hall dormitory for midshipmen quality of life and personal safety benefits.  Existing mobile communications coverage within this 1.4 million square foot historic facility is inadequate to accommodate evolving midshipmen, staff and faculty needs.  The envisioned provider-neutral solution will include a distributed antenna system (DAS) enabling robust signal coverage for the benefit of all occupants.  FY 2016 follow-on extends cellular coverage to academic buildings for enhancement of classroom and laboratory instruction as existing mobile communications coverage within these facilities is inadequate to accommodate evolving science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and cyber computing needs of midshipmen, faculty and staff.\n\nB.  LAN Room Entry Control and Video Surveillance ($474K in FY 2015):\nProvides current technology capability for management and protection of the Academy's numerous distributed local area network equipment spaces.  The system will provide integrated card reader systems for controlled access  and cameras for real-time and recorded playback of critical infrastructure locations to ensure a safe and secure enterprise computing environment.\n\nC.  Primary Storage System Replacement ($400K in FY 2015):\nProvides for IT hardware and software in support of the data storage simplification and redundancy for mission's execution and continuity.  The proposed replacement system will facilitate on-site back-up and recovery activities in maximizing enterprise system user availability.\n\nD.  Bridge Simulator Upgrade ($491K in FY 2016):\nProvides life-cycle upgrades to extend the useful life of two existing full-mission bridge simulator devices used for watchstanding training and qualification of midshipmen. It is also used for demonstrations of ship handling and navigation learning points not otherwise possible to convey through existing  underway laboratories (i.e. Yard Patrol Craft).\n\nE.  Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ($315K in FY 2016):\nProvides  lifecycle replacement of outdated electronic  classroom workstations and operating systems by standardizing content delivery through central hosting to reduce operating costs and information assurance risks.\n\nF.  NMR Spectrometer Replacement ($442K in FY 2016):\nReplaces an existing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data acquisition device acquired in FY 2004.  The device permits spectral analysis of a wide variety of chemical compounds in support of curriculum requirements.  The American Chemical Society guidelines specifically list an operational NMR spectrometer as a requirement for accreditation.\n\nG.  Library Circulation System Replacement ($347K in FY 2016):\nProvides upgrades to the existing library circulation, inventory and security system. Provides more efficient use of staff time by permitting simultaneous processing of materials and automatically updating system records without need for repeat data entry errors.  Replaces existing, obsolete, manual barcode system with industry-standard, distributed solution typically found in facilities of this type.\n\n[P40A \/ A.  Universal Wireless Telecommunications System]: Provides upgrades of existing telecommunications system to enhance cellular and Wi-Fi coverage within the historic Bancroft Hall dormitory for midshipmen quality of life and personal safety benefits.

Primary Storage System Replacement]: Provides for IT hardware and software in support of the data storage simplification and redundancy for mission's execution and continuity.  The proposed replacement system will facilitate on-site back-up and recovery activities in maximizing enterprise system user availability.  Future periodic replacement will be required to maintain technological currency and meet increased storage demand.\n\n[P40A \/ D.  LAN Room Video Surveillance]: Provides for management and protection of the Academy's numerous distributed local area network equipment spaces.  The system will provide cameras for real-time and recorded playback of critical infrastructure locations to ensure a safe and secure enterprise computing environment.\n\n[P40A \/ H.  NMR Spectrometer Replacement]: Replaces an existing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data acquisition device acquired in FY 2004.  The device permits spectral analysis of a wide variety of chemical compounds in support of curriculum requirements.  The American Chemical Society guidelines specifically list an operational NMR spectrometer as a requirement for accreditation.\n\n[P40A \/ I.  Library Circulation System Replacement]: Provides upgrades to the existing library circulation, inventory and security system.  Provides more efficient use of staff time by permitting simultaneous processing of materials and automatically update system records without need for repeat data entry errors.  Replaces existing, obsolete, manual barcode system with industry-standard, distributed solution typically found in facilities of this type.\n\n[P40A \/ J.  Virtual Desktop Infrastructure]: Provides lifecycle replacement of outdated electronic classroom workstations and operating systems by standardizing content delivery through central hosting to reduce operating costs and information assurance risks.\n\n[P40A \/ N.  Bridge Simulator Upgrade]: Provides life-cycle upgrades to extend the useful life of two existing full-mission bridge simulator devices used for watchstanding training and qualification of midshipmen.

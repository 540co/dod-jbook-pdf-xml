Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. \n\nFunding for this effort is contained in PE 0201122F USCENTCOM Communications.\n\nUSCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: Effort will provide end of life replacement for, but not limited to, Command and Control (C2) systems (thin client, server, etc), Joint Information Environment (JIE), classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, storage area network (SAN) infrastructure, establishment of the CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN) which provides a new secure network for bilateral \/ multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level. Support maximum data storage capacity requirements for HQ war records collection, Modeling & Simulation Systems (J8MS), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR. \n\nPE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS\n\nAir Forces United States Central Command (AFCENT) is the ACC component designated to support USCENTCOM operations in deployed theaters for the AF. Funds C4 systems throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Procurement efforts include: communications infrastructure requirements, satellite terminal equipment, data network servers and associated information assurance tools, information transfer nodes and routers, joint radio relays, as well as deployed air traffic control and landing systems and navigational aid systems."

The C4\/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of current, ongoing contingency operations, and the growth of data storage requirements. \n\nSTORAGE CAPABILITIES: HQ CENTCOM and CENTCOM Forward HQ require maximum storage capabilities to maintain a level of readiness, reduce server footprint, and continue capabilities as they are implemented. \n\n\nPE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS FY18 funds will provide:\n\nBASE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE (C4I) INFRASTRUCTURE. This FY18 effort will support communications CENTCOM Theater Posture Plan (TPP) locations identified for post OEF support. This effort is required at several AFCENT locations in the AOR and will provide critical infrastructure to support the transition to the Joint Information Environment, as required by DoD CIO mandate.\n\n\nSWA-THEATER ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS - To meet Unified Capabilities (UC) requirements as required by DoD mandate, and USCENTCOM directing components to transition to an IP-converged architecture in 2017, AFCENT must replace legacy Promina equipment at GSUs. AFCENT must also procure new systems to support contingency operations and base opening\/closure requirements, which average 2 base openings and\/or closures per year regardless of new or ongoing contingencies. \n\nJOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT: Implementation of JIE at MacDill AFB with CENTCOM acting as the possible regional node. \n\n\nFY18 effort will continue to support infrastructure and services essential secure networks for bilateral and multilateral information up to the secret releasable level. Support the networks and cross domain solution necessary to securely and safely integrate coalition sensors and C2 capabilities with C2 efforts. Includes integration of Coalition operations into our Combined Air Operations Center at Al Uedied AB"

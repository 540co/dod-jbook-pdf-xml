The items being procured are commercial software licenses to allow limited\/full deployment. The software is known to work in commercial environments. MROI will test the Air Force configuration of the software in DISA environments with added Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE)objects.\nTesting will be performed as part of the System Implementer activities. The contract was awarded 11 Jul 2018. MROI DT&E is projected for Mar 2020, IOT&E is projected for Apr 2020 and FOT&E is projected for Jan 2022. \n\nMaintenance Repair and Overhaul Initiative will be using, for the first time in FY 2019, 3080 funding to support CY 2022 delivery of the MROI capability currently under development (RDT&E).\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0708055F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

            "val": "Description: \nThe Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a RC-12 fixed-wing, airborne, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) collection and precision targeting location system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command\u2019s Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army\u2019s AISR 2020 strategy, the Army\u2019s Acquisition Objective\/Army\u2019s Procurement Objective is 14 RC-12X+; seven (7) will be fielded to 3rd MI; and seven (7) will be fielded to the 204th MI. Additionally, there are five (5) trainers to support Force Generation.\n\nThis funding line supports the Army Fixed Wing aircraft in support of the Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) RC-12X aircraft, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission. It provides for the following: the procurement of replacement and spare engines; procurement and associated testing of civil and military aircraft equipment, and future integration efforts. These modifications address all Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to current and evolving international and Army Standards. These modifications ensure continued worldwide deployment capability and safe operations. Lastly, this line supports future mods in service. \n\nThe overall GRCS procurement\/modernization efforts are found in the following two lines: AZ2052 Guardrail Payloads (MIP) and A02111 GRCS SEMA MODS (MIP). Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive\u2019s directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Office for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors."

This line also funds the procurement and integration of ARC 201 Single Channel Ground Air Radio Systems (SINCGARS) to address obsolescence issues.  \n\nAll COMPO 1.

Additionally, funds support Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) Special Tests, First Article Tests, Renovation of Field Stocks and Proof of Acceptance Tests used in both training and combat ammunition."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1,998 million support the Components and Renovation of Field Stock (C&R) effort. C&R supports the renovation of unserviceable training and combat ammunition, returning unserviceable items to issuable, serviceable condition at a substantial cost savings to the Army when compared to costs to demilitarize and procure new, replacement stock. Proposed C&R efforts undergo cost analysis to compare proposed renovation costs or rework efforts to the cost associated with demilitarization and new procurement to ensure efforts conducted under C&R result in a cost savings to the Army. The efforts are primarily focused on condition codes E and F within Army inventory.  \n\nFY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.478 million supports several initiatives at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) and Yuma Test Center (YTC).\n\nAt ATC, continue a replacement and procurement program for weapons and weapon components that are worn during testing of production ammunition items.  Typical purchases include:  rifle\/carbine\/machine gun barrels, receivers, and parts; large caliber barrels; small and medium caliber Mann-type test barrels, mortar barrels and bipod\/baseplates.\n\nAt YTC, acquires weapon components required for continued support of the Production Acceptance Test (PAT) as part of the indirect fire test mission.  Purchases include components such as breeches and tubes for medium to large caliber mortars and cannons.\n\nAt YTC, procures replacement parts for both large and small caliber direct fire weapon systems for production based support.  The primary items to be purchased are recoils, breeches, cradles, and gun tubes for both 120mm M256 and 105mm M68 cannons. In addition, spares will be obtained for 25mm and small arms weapon systems, along with other supporting equipment such as solenoids and bore-sighting equipment."

        "Description": {
            "val": "The Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capabilities (ERACC) consists of four (4) independent products that enhance the joint commander's capability for Enable Theater Access (ETA) operations.  ERACC provides the joint commander the capability enhancement to rapidly construct new airfields, runways and to upgrade existing facilities to meet joint task force needs. This expands operating capacities of Aerial ports Embarkation\/Debarkation (APOE\/APOD).  ERACC Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV are commercial off the shelf (COTS) programs. Joint U.S. Forces will employ ERACC types (I-IV) individually or as a combined mission based on engineer requirements.  \n\nERACC Type I, Site Selection and Assessment. This capability package is a software centric capability used to rapidly assess potential sites for airfield operations.  This capability provides geospatial information, site analysis, terrain visualization, airfield performance predictions, constructability estimations, on-site material characterization, and site design capabilities. The fielding of the ERACC Type I software will be to users of the ENFIRE engineer reconnaissance system as part of the ENFIRE 7.0 software baseline, and will be included in all subsequent baselines. The users include construction engineer platoon leaders, engineer liaison teams, facilities managers, and contracting personnel within Engineer organizations for construction project management, reconnaissance, facilities and inventory management, Tele-engineering, site layout, rudimentary surveying, mapping, and associated reporting.  The ERACC Type I system is a software application on the ENFIRE system.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the Type I is 41 and will be procured by Product Director Combat Terrain Information Systems (PD CTIS). \n\nERACC Type II, Enhanced Earthmoving.  This system is a Grade Control System that includes a global positioning system (GPS) and laser leveling system that is installed on a dozer, grader, scraper and Deployable Universal Combat Earthmover (DEUCE).  The ERACC Type II enables Combat Engineer units with the capability to efficiently fulfill Joint Engineer Mission requirements across all phases of Joint Military Operations and conduct Joint Functions and Joint Forcible Entry Operations.  U.S. Army Engineers employ the ERACC II in direct support of Joint Functions of (1) Movement and Maneuver: Combat Roads and Trails, Gap Crossing, Lines of Communications and\/or Supply Routes, Intermediate Staging Bases and (2) Sustainment:  Base Camp Development, Construction and Repair of Infrastructure and Facilities.  U.S. Army Engineers employ ERACC Type II in direct support of Joint Forcible Entry Operations of (1) Forcible Entry Phase III Stabilization of the Lodgment:  Repair, Rehabilitation, Expansion, and Upkeep of Runways, Aprons, Taxiways, and Parking areas to support continuous Air-Landing operations and (2) Forcible Entry Phase IV Introduction of Follow-on Forces: Ports of Debarkation are maintained to maximize and sustain throughput for follow-on forces.  A commercial Grade Control System that is cross-functional and fully interoperable on Dozers, Graders, Motorized Scrapers, and the Deployable Universal Combat Earthmover (DEUCE), the ERACC Type II improves construction productivity by essentially eliminating operator error, increasing earthmoving efficiency and reducing project completion times.  The ERACC Type II imports site design data produced by the survey and design team; stores and provides a 3-D display for equipment operators; tracks machine location, and provides cut & fill information for the operator without the use of grade stakes.  The AAO for the Type II 342  will be procured by PM Combat Engineer\/Material Handling Equipment (CE\/MHE).  \n\nERACC Type III, Mobile Technical Engineer Lab (MTEL) is an integration of commercially available non-developmental items.  MTEL effort is a C130 airplane Low Velocity Air Droppable (LVAD)\/CH-47 helicopter sling transportable package enhancing a modularly designed capability to rapidly open new airfields and runways, and\/or upgrade existing facilities to meet joint task force needs.  The MTEL provides a soil test and survey capability utilizing a utility vehicle.  This allows the ERACC Team to quickly understand the composition of the soil to determine feasibility for construction of an airfield. The MTEL can also be used for recon and scouting once the lab package is removed. The fielding of the MTEL will be within Engineer Support Company and Engineer Support Teams.  The ERACC Type III AAO is 86 and will be procured by PM CE\/MHE.\n\nERACC Type IV, Soil Stabilization. This system is essential to mix soil stabilization products with soil to produce desired stabilized base layers suitable for aircraft traffic operations.  This system supports rapid construction and or expansion of airfield operation capacities.  It will also be employed during the construction\/upgrading of helipads as a means to prevent brownout conditions from occurring during helicopter landing and takeoff operations. The machine is equipped with an onboard automated liquid distribution system that matches the desired liquid polymer application rate to the machines ground speed.  It has the capability to continuously operate for a period of 10 hours.  The Soil Reclaimer Stabilizer will be fielded to the Rapidly Deployable Earthmoving-Light (RDE-L) Platoon within the Engineer Support Company (ESC), Engineer Survey and Design Sections, Engineer Geospatial Cells, Forward Engineer Support Teams, and Technical Engineer Sections.  The ERACC Type IV AAO is 31 and will be procured by PM CE\/MHE."

The Manpack (MP) Radio is reflected under SSN B90210 in FY 2011 and 2012. The MP Radio is reflected under separate SSN B90215 in FY 2013 and out. \n\nAs of FY 2017, HMS funding transferred from the parent B90000 to the parent B95004. B90210 and B90215 transferred to B95006 (Handheld), and B95007 (Manpack) respectively. This change was made in order to remove \"JTRS\" from the HMS nomenclature as the program is now Army led. \n\nThe Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a materiel solution meeting requirements for Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant Government Purpose Rights software waveforms (applications). HMS is an Acquisition Category IC program that encompasses specific requirements to support the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. \n\nHMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge\/most disadvantaged warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS) \/ Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable,  networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communications.\n\nHMS encompasses the Handheld (HH) Radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR)), MP, and Small Form Fit (SFF) radios. HMS radios will provide voice and support for data services such as text, control graphics, imagery, video, and telemetry to Warfighters and tactical end user devices including handheld, embedded, and larger computing devices, as well as unmanned systems.\n\nThe current HH AAO (Army Acquisition Objective) is 193,279:\n-100,000 LR\n-93,279 RR\n\nThe current MP AAO is 65,622"

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2019 OCO funding in the amount of $1.560 million is requested in this SSN in error. Funds support the Handheld Manpack Small Form Fit (HMS) program, SSN B95004, but were programmed in this line in error. The error was detected too late to make the correction formally.  Funds should be appropriated in B95004, specifically to support Handheld Radio, B95006. \n\nAll funding previously requested in the JTRS program has been realigned from the parent B90000 to the parent Handheld Manpack Small Form Fit (HMS), B95004. B90210 and B90215 realign to B95006 (Handheld), and B95007 (Manpack) respectively. This change was made in order to remove \"JTRS\" from the HMS nomenclature as the program is now Army led. \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), these items are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

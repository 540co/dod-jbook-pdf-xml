This is comprised of unified, consolidated and shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and standardized security architectures throughout the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.  \n\nThe target objective state of JIE is a DODIN that optimizes the use of DoD's IT assets from the administrative and operational planning at the Pentagon to the tactical edge; to include our mission partners through converging communications, computing, enterprise services, and defense of the DODIN that can be leveraged for all Department missions. \n\nWhen implemented, JIE will reduce DoD's Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improved security by reducing the attack surface of our networks, and enable Combatant Commands\/Services\/Agencies (CC\/S\/A) to more efficiently access information to perform their missions from any authorized IT device, any time, from anywhere in the world."

The focus of this funding is to expedite the expansion and implementation of JIE and JRSS in USPACOM.  Once complete, the updates will be available for use by everyone connected to the DODIN.  In addition, this will expand the USCYBERCOM commander and intelligence agencies ability to support and defend the network by centralizing command and control with consolidation of network issues, vectors of attach, and other hostile actions against the DODIN. \n\nFY 2017 ($0.00) \n\nExplanation of Change from FY 2016 to FY 2017: Decrease of -$84.400 from FY 2016 to FY 2017 was because funding was realigned to Line Item 96 Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS)."

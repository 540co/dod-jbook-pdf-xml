            "val": "DDG 1000, a multi-mission surface combatant, will serve as a versatile asset in the context of future Naval Strategy.  Armed with an array of weapons, DDG 1000 will provide the Joint Force Commander with precision strike and volume fires.  Designed with sustainable payload, multi-spectral stealth and optimal manning, DDG 1000 will take the fight to the enemy with unprecedented striking power.\n\nProgram provides for DDG 1000 combat system hardware\/equipment suite technology refresh to support obsolescence management and address reliability, maintainability & availability (RM&A) issues following fielding. Combat\nSystem hardware will be approaching 10 years of age at time of delivery for DDG 1000 and 1001. Active management of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) obsolescence via hardware\/equipment technology refresh will be required\nto ensure DDG 1000 class ships reach their design service life. Additionally, program will sustain and upgrade in-service DDG 1000 ships in order to achieve their Expected Service Life (ESL). Upgrades will be mission capable in\ncountering current and projected threats, improve operational capabilities, and comply with requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1000 Data Center]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of critical technology refresh of the technical baseline for the first DDG 1000 data center (2 per ship) to enable the DDG 1000 combat system to operate with two (2) fully populated data centers (computer rooms). Technology refresh includes identification and qualification of applicable obsolete DDG 1000 data center parts, technical drawing updates (Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) & cabinet level), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) updates (LRU & cabinet level). Two (2) fully populated data centers on DDG 1000 enable shipboard integrated training, support Overall Combat System Operability Test (OCSOT) implementation, support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, and provide system redundancy in the event of operational casualty.  Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems. DDG 1000 data centers house the Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE); a single, secure network that includes all shipboard computing applications, from Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4), and intelligence equipment to Combat Management Systems (CMSs) to machinery control and embedded training, support, and damage control systems.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG 1001 Data Center]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of critical technology refresh of the technical baseline for the first DDG 1001 data center (2 per ship) to enable the DDG 1000 combat system to operate with two (2) fully populated data centers (computer rooms). Technology refresh includes identification and qualification of applicable obsolete DDG 1000 data center parts, technical drawing updates (Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) & cabinet level), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) updates (LRU & cabinet level).

Other modernization efforts include but are not limited to logistics and technical documentation, engineering services and Alteration Installation Team (AITs) within the Fleet Modernization Program (FMP).  FY2017 funding will procure DDG 1000 Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) network switches which are critical items required to support DDG 1000 Data Center technology refresh.  These TSCE network switches support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, address obsolescence, and require configuration engineering prior to installation. Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems."

GFEBS is the Department of the Army's enterprise financial and asset management system. GFEBS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC). GFEBS is fielded to more than 53,000 trained users at over 227 installations worldwide and is the Army's enterprise solution in accounting and financial management. GFEBS provides improved functionality in general fund core financial functions including: general ledger management; financial reporting; real property, plant, and equipment accountability; reimbursable, revenue, and accounts receivable; cost management; funds control and budgetary accounting; accounts payable; and audit trails and system controls and meets legislative mandates to develop an auditable financial system. The primary objectives for the GFEBS financial management system are to provide an integrated off the shelf capability for general fund management for the Army that meets requirements for auditability, and to improve performance, standardize business processes, ensure capability exists to meet future needs, and provide Army's decision makers with relevant, reliable, and timely information.\n\nGFEBS-Sensitive Activities (SA) provides a classified version of the GFEBS program developed to process data in a secure environment to protect and manage classified data. GFEBS-SA will integrate seamlessly with GFEBS and provide a secure, web-based, financial asset and accounting management system to Army classified, intelligence, and special access programs."

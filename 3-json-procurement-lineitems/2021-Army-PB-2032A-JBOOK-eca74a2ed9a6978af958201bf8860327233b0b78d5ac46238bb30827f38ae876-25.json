It sustained Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that were technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provided increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity, and cost avoidance to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding was used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico and Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, Alabama."

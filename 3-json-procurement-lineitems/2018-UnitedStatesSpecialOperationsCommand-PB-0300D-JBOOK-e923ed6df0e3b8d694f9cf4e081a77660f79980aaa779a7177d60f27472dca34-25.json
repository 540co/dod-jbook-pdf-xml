Each requirement is vetted through a rigorous USSOCOM process and must meet the following criteria:  provide force protection to troops or ensure mission success.  Equipment purchased under the CMNS umbrella include, but are not limited to, radios, intelligence equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, blast and ballistic protected tactical vehicles, ammunition, weapons, aircraft defensive systems, night vision devices, and aircraft precision strike systems.   USSOCOM submits a quarterly report to Congress that describes the CMNS approved that quarter."

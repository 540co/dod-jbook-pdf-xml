            "val": "This program provides for the initial procurement and distribution of General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE).  This equipment is essential to the operational readiness of the Navy for repair, installation, and maintenance (preventive and routine) of electronic systems and equipments, both afloat and ashore.  The GPETE procured must meet rigid technical requirements, be cost effective and satisfy valid deficiencies in authorized allowance. Within the TMDE program, GPETE is classified under 4 functional groups: Fiber Optics (M600), Signal Generators (M6001), Oscilloscopes & Meters (M6002), and Passive\/Ancillary\/Mechanical (M6004). The program also breaks out a fifth cost code (M6003) for non-equipment (i.e. labor) tasks including engineering, procurement and integrated logistics support. The TMDE program procures Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS; i.e. non-government manufactured test equipment that is available to the general public) GPETE to address the maintenance requirements across shipboard\/shore- based activities and programs. Approximately 80% of the annual test equipment requirements are procured through the DOD Supply System, or MILSTRIP, process. When the program procures through MILSTRIP, DLA or NAVSUP WSS fills the requisition. The remaining 20% of procurements are Simplified Acquisition Purchase (SAP) contracts or purchase card (P-card) buys. SAP and P-card requisitions are utilized only for obsolete test equipment that is no longer available for procurement through MILSTRIP. Any variance in unit costs and quantity across fiscal years is attributable to the diversity and varying complexity of the Commercial-off-the-Shelf GPETE to be procured from year to year to address the maintenance requirements across shipboard\/shore- based activities and programs."

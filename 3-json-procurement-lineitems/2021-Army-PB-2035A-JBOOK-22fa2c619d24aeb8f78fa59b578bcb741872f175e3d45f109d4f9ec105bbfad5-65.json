These procurements include offices, armories, and billeting in enduring locations within countries such as Kuwait, Qatar and U.A.E.  The buildings are needed to provide and\/or replace working and living facilities for troops in the enduring locations.  Without the new buildings, troops would continue to live and work in expeditionary facilities and tents in enduring locations with exceptionally hot climates creating safety and health risks.  Without the ability to replace relocatable buildings that are beyond life cycle, troops would continue to live in buildings that will become unrepairable and expose them to potential electrical dangers.  There are several thousand relocatable buildings within the Operation Spartan Shield (OSS) footprint that will be included in this life cycle program.\n\nFY2021 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $3.093 million procures up to 14 relocatable buildings to replace facilities for the Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) mission and to emplace needed facilities at LSA Danger on Erbil International Airport, Iraq and LSA Union III, Iraq for US personnel in support of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).  Without the new buildings, troops would continue to live in buildings that will become unrepairable and expose them to potential electrical dangers and troops would continue to live and work in expeditionary facilities and tents in locations with exceptionally hot climates creating safety and health risks.\n\nIn FY 2021, $0.000 million in Reimbursable Manpower for this line has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance.  Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.\n------------\n\nAll funding goes to the Active Component."

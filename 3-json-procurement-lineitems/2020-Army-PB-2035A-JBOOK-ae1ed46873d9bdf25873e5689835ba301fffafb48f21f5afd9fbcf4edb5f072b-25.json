            "val": "The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) provides Soldiers with advanced active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing (from harmful Impulse and Steady-State Noises), while enabling situational awareness (e.g., enhanced ability to detect sounds) and mission command (e.g., voice communications over a tactical radio). TCAPS enhances survivability and situational awareness by protecting Soldiers from noise induced hearing loss. Soldiers wearing TCAPS are provided the capability to amplify faint sounds that under normal circumstance would not be audible or intelligible with the naked ear, as well as the ability to detect the direction of the sound, while wearing a hearing protection device.\n\nTCAPS employs Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated on a periodic basis, in order to validate performance requirements and Soldier acceptance. The best commercial solution(s) evaluated are transitioned into sustainment and fielding. TCAPS hearing protection contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. To accommodate existing situations for Soldiers not assigned a tactical radio, the TCAPS Program includes a TCAPS-Lite variant that provides hearing protection and situational awareness similar to that of a TCAPS.\n\nTCAPS Approved Acquisition Objective is 111,347."

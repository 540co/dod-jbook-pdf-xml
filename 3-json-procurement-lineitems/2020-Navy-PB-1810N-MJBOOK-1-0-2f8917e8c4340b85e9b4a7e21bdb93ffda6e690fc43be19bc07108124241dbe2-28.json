            "val": "The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $1.0 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThe Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\n[P40A \/ M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters, required by 10 CFR 20 and the Navy's mission, are used to detect, measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors, maintenance on radioactive systems or components, testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray), research, and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally, radiation survey meters are used to search for, locate and intercept radioactive material, and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material, they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.\n\n[P40A \/ Radiological Detection System]: M2100, Radiological Detection System (RDS):  This is a basic RADIAC instrument used in Consequence Management and Occupational Safety and Health applications by all ships (U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command) and shore commands.  It is used to survey for radioactive surface contamination pursuant to nuclear plant operations or nuclear plant maintenance; following medical procedures involving radioactive isotopes; or casualties and events that release radioactivity into the environment such as after a nuclear reactor accident or the use of weapons involving nuclear devices or radioactivity.  It is also used to perform surveys for various types of radiation in order to monitor environmental conditions in areas and spaces immediately adjacent to where radioactive material is stored or used during routine operations; where nuclear plant operations occur; and where radioisotopes are used for maintenance, such as during industrial radiography operations.\n\nThe RDS consists of a Control Unit and a suite of probes that survey for different types of radioactivity (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Neutron).  Also part of the procurement will be various types of connecting cables; carrying cases; telescoping handles; and three specialty probes.  The Control Unit is necessary for all applications while the probes are used for different applications.  That means the Control Unit will have the highest procurement objective and the probes and ancillary equipment will be bought in varying quantities.  \n\nThis instrument will replace the Navy's 30-year old IM-265\/PDQ Multi-Function RADIAC Control Unit and its probes.  The RDS is being developed by the Joint Product Leader for Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPdL-RND) in order that the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force will all have a Joint instrument that will enable interoperability and surge support of assets from all the components to forward deployed units in a theater of operations where a radiological event arises.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt, on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. \n\nIn accordance with 10 CFR 20, dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.\n\n[P40A \/ DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200, DT-702 Card Holder:  A plastic case into which the DT-702 card is placed for the card's protection and so it can be worn on a lanyard or on a belt.  It has four circular windows made of specific materials of various thickness to allow the proper filtration of radiation to the dosimeter elements under each of the windows.\n\n[P40A \/ Extremity Dosimeter]: M2200, Extremity Dosimeter:  An extremity dosimeter is used to measure concentrated exposure to the hands when a radiation worker is reaching into a glove box or medical personnel are performing fluoroscopy tasks.  This item is composed of three inexpensive pieces:  1) a plastic ring ($2) to wear on a finger; 2) a dosimeter ($36) that measures exposure; and 3) a cap that secures the dosimeter to the ring.  The cap is made to a specific thickness depending on the type of radiation the dosimeter is intended to measure ($3).  These items will be procured in quantities of 3,000 each.  An average unit cost for the three items is used and all 9,000 components are shown on this one Cost Element.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter:  The Accident Dosimeter is a passive type nuclear dosimeter capable of detecting and recording fast neutron radiation exposures. These dosimeters are used to determine radiation dose to the crew in the event of an accident affecting operation of a nuclear reactor.  These dosimeters are fastened near or adjacent to reactor compartments on all Navy submarines and carriers.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter High Purity Germanium  Detector]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter High Purity Germanium Detector:  The portable High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector is used to measure the photon radiation emitting from the dosimeter as a result of the reactor accident. This instrument is used at the Naval Dosimetry Center to evaluate the results of an accident.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter Alpha\/Beta Detector]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter Alpha\/Beta Detector:  The portable Alpha\/Beta Detector is used to measure the alpha and beta radiation emitting from the dosimeter as a result of a reactor accident.  This instrument is used at the Naval Dosimetry Center to evaluate the results of an accident.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter Data & Training]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter Data & Training:  The Naval Dosimetry Center staff will be trained on how to evaluate the dosimeter.  The vendor will supply Technical Manuals, Technical Repair Standards and Standard Calibration Procedure documentation in order for the detectors purchased to be maintained by Navy Radiation Calibration Laboratories.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter:  A dosimeter designed for use during nuclear or radiological events involving high energy gamma and neutron irradiation.  An \"event\" can be a nuclear reactor accident, such as the Fukushima disaster in 2011, or an attack on, e.g., a Carrier Strike Group using a nuclear or radiological (dirty bomb) weapon.  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP (Military Operational Posture) III to allow the commander to manage the exposure received by members of recovery teams who would be deployed in order to maintain continuity of operations.  It is also used to perform triage on casualties, allowing medical personnel to most effectively allocate their resources.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter Cases]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter Cases:  The Battlefield Dosimeter will spend much of its time aboard ships stored in Damage Control Lockers.  The instrument will also have to be shipped to and from a RADIAC Calibration Laboratory to undergo periodic calibrations.  Because allowances for the instruments on the various ship classes range from 12 on an LCS to 700 each on a CVN, cases configured to hold different quantities (25, 50, 100) will be procured to afford the necessary protection for storage and shipping while maximizing shipboard storage space efficiency.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter Data, Training & Testing]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter Data & Training:  The Technical Data Package includes the Technical Manual (TM), Technical Repair Standard (TRS),  Standard Calibration Procedure (SCP), Product Drawings, Electronic Magnetic Interference & Prompt Nuclear Test Report. These documents are needed to maintain, repair and calibrate the IM-276A\/PD. The test report will provide the needed objective quality evidence showing compliance)prior to delivery of the dosimeters.  The vendor was also contracted to convert the TM,TRS and SCP documents from COTS into standard military manual format.\n\nThe Data Acquisition System\/Calibration Software includes the hardware and calibration software used to calibrate, configure, assign, reset and re-zero the IM-276A\/PD. This software will then be submitted for NMCI certification and DADMS approval and pushed to the calibration laboratories.\n\nTraining will be conducted at a Navy RADIAC Calibration Laboratory for technicians who are responsible for the maintenance and repair of equipment.  Training will include a review of the repairable parts and step-by-step instruction on how to perform the standard calibration procedure the technicians will employ to keep the equipment adjusted to specified tolerances. \n\nTesting of 200 Low Rate Initial Production units was conducted at White Sands Missile Range to ensure the instrument met Navy specifications for response to neutron and prompt gamma radiation.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Personal Dosimeter]: M2200, Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD):  An electronic dosimeter that includes a real-time digital display of radiation dose being received.  These so-called secondary dosimeters are normally used in conjunction with the DT-702 primary dosimeter in order to provide the wearer with real-time radiation dose information and alarm features that aid workers in controlling their radiation exposure.  The DT-702 (Cost Element 2.1) is the Navy's approved dosimeter to record dose of record in each individual's medical record, but it is a \"passive\" device; i.e., it does not immediately display the dose being received.  Instead, the dose is stored on the card on four different elements. It must be turned in and read by a machine (the 8800 Reader), a process that takes weeks, and therefore does not indicate if the wearer is in imminent danger.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2400 - Other RADIAC]: M2400.  Other RADIAC.  The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  The M2400 Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality with which they could be grouped.\n\nThis Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.\n\n[P40A \/ Spares]: M2400, Spares:  Purchase of additional quantities of existing models of RADIACs to replenish or supplement stocks of items due to minor increases in program allowances, inventory losses, or due to assets being beyond economical repair.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: M2500.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.\nFixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Detector (APD) Ship Frames]: M2500, Air Particle Detector (APD), Ship, Frames:  Government Furnished Material (GFM) to be provided to the manufacturer of the APD Ship (IM-272\/WDQ).  The frame is a 300 pound sheet metal cabinet a little larger than a compact refrigerator.  Preparation of the frame and its components to become IM-272 GFM includes the complete disassembly of the unit, then cleaning, blasting, powder coating, painting, and refurbishing of the cabinet, and repairing, replacing, testing, and reassembling the internal components.  Use of these frames and components reduces the overall cost of the IM-272\/WDQ and avoids the cost of a ship alteration by ensuring the IM-272\/WDQ will have the same shipboard footprint as the IM-239\/WDQ.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship:  Airborne radioactivity monitoring system that is required for use on CVNs and all submarines.   This system (IM-272\/WDQ) is a replacement for the existing IM-239\/WDQ used on all Navy nuclear ships.   The IM-272\/WDQ incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Data]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Data:  This data includes a one-time cost for Technical Manuals in FY18 for the acoustic model.  Subsequent years include the Technical Repair Standard, drawings, and production reports with every delivery order.  After FY18, the cost of data will be included in the unit price.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Initial Spare Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship, Initial Spare Parts:  In FY17 procure initial spare parts to support fielding.  In FY18, procure two Flow Meter Test Sets.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Upgrade Kit]: M2500, APD Ship Upgrade Kit:  The Navy procured the first lot of IM-272 APDs in FY14.  Subsequent to that delivery order an Engineering Change Proposal was directed by Naval Reactors in order to accommodate more stringent acoustic specifications for the COLOMBIA class submarines.  Ten of the IM-272 will be retrofitted with new parts to upgrade them to the IM-272A model.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Provisioning]: M2500, APD Ship Provisioning:  In FY18 the contractor will host a provisioning conference at which the equipment will be broken down to Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SM&R) codes and where maintenance philosophies will be established for each part for the acoustic upgrade model.  In FY19 The APD Ship Configuration Audit will validate the \"as-built\" production unit against the Technical Data Package.  The audit will also verify compliance with the Performance and Testing Specification.  Program Reviews will be performed on a quarterly basis to monitor production progress, assess significant Government Furnished Parts issues, and review status of data deliverables.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship GFP Repair by Contractor]: M2500, APD Ship GFP Repair by Contractor:  The APD Ship utilizes Government Furnished Property (GFP) in its\ndesign.  The Government prepares the GFP prior to shipment to the contractor.  Certain pieces require additional repair work by the contractor.  The Government will fund the contractor to repair GFP as needed in order to mitigate risks to cost and schedule.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Drawing Revisions]: M2500, APD Ship Drawing Revisions:  The Government is providing the Technical Data Package (TDP) to the contractor to build the APD Ship.  The contractor may identify issues with the TDP that need to be resolved prior to manufacturing\nthe assemblies and subassemblies within the APD Ship.  The Government will assess whether the issues require adjudication prior to production.  The contractor will be funded to correct these issues upon contract award.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Program Reviews]: M2500, APD Ship Program Reviews:  The contractor will host quarterly program reviews during the life of the contract, to be conducted at the contractor's site. The contractor will brief topics to include, but not limited to, testing and manufacturing issues, Government Furnished Property (GFP) usage, and the milestone plan. Risks to the schedule and the corresponding risk mitigation methods shall be discussed. The contractor will make a teleconference line available for individuals not able to attend the review in person.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Sampler]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler:  Portable airborne radioactivity sampling system.  Used during radiological work or during radiological casualties to draw air across a filter paper to collect radioactive particles.  The filter paper is then evaluated using separately provided radiation detectors to determine the concentration of airborne radioactivity.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor]: M2500, Tritium Monitor:  The AN\/PDR-73 Tritium Monitor is used at nuclear weapons storage facilities and research laboratories to sample the air for the presence of tritium, which is a toxic radiation hazard if inhaled. The current instrument is 30 years old and cannot be repaired due to obsolete components. At the current loss rate due to normal wear and tear there will be insufficient assets to meet operational requirements, so a replacement must be procured.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts & Training]: M2500, Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts & Training:  Electro Magnetic Interference testing, Testing Manuals, Technical Repair Standard.  Training of RADIAC Calibration Laboratory electronic technicians and program engineers on how to maintain the equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment]: M2600.  This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and test facilities.  This kind of equipment is distinct enough to warrant separating it for management purposes from the M2400 Cost Code.\n\n[P40A \/ RITES]: M2600, RITES:  The RADIAC Integrated Test Equipment Suite (RITES) is an automated system that replaces several legacy  diagnostic test equipment instruments technicians use in the routine calibration and maintenance of RADIACs.  This is a modular IT system that will be installed at each of the seven Navy RADIAC Calibration Laboratories.  Each system consists of laptops, special interface cards, a server, docking stations, and software licenses.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrators]: M2600, Calibrators:  Calibrators (also known as irradiators) are the basic tool used to calibrate all Navy radiological detection equipment.  They consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed room, or \"range.\" A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that the radiological source becomes exposed and it irradiates the instrument. The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances. \n\nThe current suite of AN\/UDM-1B calibrators is over 30 years old, and the natural decay of the strength of the radioactive source over time restricts calibration effectiveness by limiting the scale of calibration points below American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements that are followed in accordance with Navy policy. Also, due to the age of the calibrators, there are several parts no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a malfunctioning calibrator (e.g., where the radioactive source gets stuck in the exposed position) poses a very high safety risk.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrator, No Source]: M2600, Calibrator, No Source:  This unit will be located at the lead RADIAC Calibration Laboratory where technicians and engineers will be trained on calibrator maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair without requiring the constraints of exercising radiation exposure controls.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrator Initial Spare Parts, Installation & Training]: M2600, Calibrator Initial Spare Parts, Installation & Training:  Initial spare parts and vendor training at each of the seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories where the equipment will be installed.  The vendor will ship and install the calibrators at each of the seven Navy RADIAC Calibration Laboratories.\n\n[P40A \/ Liquid Scintillation Counter]: M2600, Liquid Scintillation Counter: The Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) is a laboratory device designed to measure low levels of radioactivity.  Radiological monitoring requirements for the Strategic Systems Program (SSP) enterprise are driven by mission work conducted at Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) and Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (SWFPAC).  In these facilities, proximity to nuclear weapons presents potential occupational exposure to ionizing radiation.  The primary radioisotope of concern is tritium (H-3), which presents itself in particulate and gaseous form.  To monitor facilities for particulate tritium, radiological \"swipes\" are collected from various surfaces and then analyzed in a LSC to measure a representative amount of any contamination present.  The LSC is calibrated to detect radiation with energies that match the isotopes of interest. The procurement cost represents the cost of the instruments and associated peripherals and software.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 - Support - Production Engineering]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government and contractor personnel who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering Carderock]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering ISEA]: M2830, Production Engineering In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA):  Labor cost of the contractor Engineers, Logisticians, Technical Writer, Program Analyst, and Systems Analysts who help prepare the acquisitions."

            "val": "Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or who are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.

This hampered the continuity of operations because the existing BD is designed to record and display exposure beginning only at 10 rem (roentgen equivalent in man), a level associated with the detonation of a nuclear weapon.  This is a specification vestige of the Cold War.  The millirem, which is one thousandth of a rem, is used to measure dosages encountered in daily life, such as the amount of radiation received from medical X-rays, long airplane flights, background sources, and the lower levels of radiation normally associated with occupational radiological work, during which workers are exposed on a continuous basis and why their exposures are closely monitored and recorded.  To fill the gap, specifications were added to the new BD for a device that could provide real-time feedback of dose received at occupational levels.   For the first follow-on contract that was awarded in September 2017 for the improved version of the BD, the unit price was fixed at $227.25 for the duration of the contract, which runs from FY17-FY20.  The assumption for now is that in either a competitive or sole source scenario for the next follow-on contract, the price will thereafter increase at least commensurate with inflation.",

This work can be equated to Repair as defined in the reference, the lowest category of effort.  Besides the lower level of effort, no component parts\/repairs are required.  Hence the cost differential for the 90 units serviced in FY18 as compared to the 50 units per year requiring full restoration in the prior and out years.",

The price was increased due to the acoustic modifications ordered by Naval Reactors for the COLUMBIA class submarines.  The modifications driving the unit cost increase included making the pressure vessel out of a different material, installing acoustic tiles in the upper pressure vessel, installing a new muffler, and providing factory testing of the units to meet the new acoustic standard.  A new contract for the remaining units will be competed on a build to print basis and is scheduled for award in September 2019.",

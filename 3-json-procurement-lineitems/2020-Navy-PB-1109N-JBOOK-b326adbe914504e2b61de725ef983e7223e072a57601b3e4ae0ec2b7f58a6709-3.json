It is a joint program between the Marine Corps and Army, which is additionally supporting various foreign military purchases of the weapon system.  The LW155 was first fielded by the Marine Corps in April 2005 and completed fielding in April 2013.  The Army has fielded the system to its Stryker Brigades and Fires Brigades and completed fielding to its Infantry Brigades in September 2018.  The LW155 is being significantly utilized in the Middle East in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  This budget line supports system updates to maintain and increase performance and lethality.  M777A2 is the prominent weapon of the Marine indirect fires triad and currently the only cannon in the Service.  Modernization efforts to include extended range will keep the M777 relevant to the concept of operations (distributed units operating with increased dispersion) envisioned in the Marine Operating Concept."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base Appropriation Request: $20.259M ($20.250M Active; $0.009M Reserve) \n\nFY 2018 funding provides funding for various modification and sustainment efforts such as Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) component refresh, integration of upgraded components, and interoperability issues including M-Code satellite signal in support of the M777A2 program.  Specifically, FY18 funding continued installations of modification kits such as the Improved Power Conditioning Control Module (I-PCCM), Electronic Thermal Warning Device (ETWD), Mission Computer (MSC-R), Chief of Section Display (CSD-R), Improved Platform Integration Kit (iPIK) and Primer Feed Mechanism (PFM) Components. The PFM and ETWD procurements are critical efforts to address current field restrictions for firing the Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) at higher elevations. Also, funded is the procurement of Chrome Cannon Tubes for the M777A2 howitzer. \n\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $37.158M ($37.152M Active; $0.006M Reserve)\n\nFY 2019 funding continued the installation of modification kits; such as the Improved Power Conditioning Control Module (I-PCCM), Mission Computer (MSC-R), and Chief of Section Display (CSD-R) ($.211M).  Additionally, funding supports the procurement of Chrome Cannon tubes ($3.710M); Software Defined Radios, cables, and brackets ($20.747M); and Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) Recapitalization ($12.490M).  Software Defined Radio modification enables more secure radio communication and facilitates new encryption protocol interoperability between artillery and supported forces.  The new radio will provide the ability to perform voice and data functions over the same radio which increases operational flexibility for firing units.  The INU recapitalization maintains the howitzers ability to navigate and aim accurately to safely provide fire support and extends the useful life of the system.  The INU provides the M777A2, in conjunction with the Vehicle Motion Senser (VMS), the capability to navigate when GPS is not available.       \n\nNet funding increase of $26.899M from FY18 to FY19 reflects the increase of procurement quantities of Software Defined Radios and commencement of INU recapitalization for the fleet as well as reduced quantities of Chrome Cannon tubes.\n\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $25.065M ($25.059M Active; $0.006M Reserve)\n\nFY 2020 funding provides for the procurement of the final lot of chrome cannon tubes (Qty 165) that will outfit the entire USMC howitzer fleet ($24.993M). Chrome Cannon Tubes increase safety, accuracy, and longevity of the howitzer by eliminating propellant residue inside the cannon tubes. Propellant residue causes spiral wear, which reduces the muzzle velocity of the howitzer, and fuze malfunctions of projectiles. Reduced muzzle velocity leads to projectiles impacting short of their intended targets. Also funded is the procurement of software defined radios, cables and brackets, and integration onto the M777A2 howitzer. FY20 funding will continue to support installation of previously procured hardware modification kits ($0.072M). \n\nNet funding decrease of $12.093M from FY19 to FY20 reflects the completion of the INU recapitalization procurement and Software Defined Radio kits for the USMC fleet."

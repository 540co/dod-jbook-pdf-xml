            "val": "1U030: Automatic Identification System (AIS) is required for safety of navigation for all surface ships and submarines.   AIS is a maritime Very High Frequency (VHF) communication system, which allows ships to exchange navigation, ship identification, and cargo information machine-to-machine via VHF transponders.  AIS provides vessels with the ability to rapidly identify and track commercial shipping, which significantly increases the Navy's ability to distinguish between normal and suspicious merchant ships headed towards United States and allied ports around the globe.  AIS provides critical track data to the Common Operational Picture (COP) on surface ships, AN\/BYG-1 Combat System on submarines, Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) on Force level ships, and Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J) at Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) for publishing AIS data to the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Data Sharing Community of Interest.  The AIS submarine configuration provides an interface to the AN\/BYG-1 Combat System and encrypted AIS capability that is currently not available on other AIS variants.  This capability dramatically improves the Combatant Commanders' situational awareness and MDA data sharing capabilities in support of regional engagement, and tracking efforts against potential maritime terrorism threats.  \n\nFunds will procure and install AIS systems for Navy ships, submarines and shore sites consisting of a combination of modified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and government\/commercial software, such as omni-directional VHF, Global Positioning System antennas, AIS transponders, displays and associated cables, servers, power supplies, laptop computers, junction boxes, switches and radio frequency couplers.  Without this configuration of AIS, Navy submarines will not be able to see encrypted AIS track data and will increase the risk of collisions."

            "val": "FY20 funds will support the procurement of four (4) AIS submarine systems and forty (40) Cyber Hardening Kits and associated design services allocation; integration testing to support AIS installations on SSBN class submarines and installation funding for five (5) submarines. Additionally, the funding supports the installation of sixty-five (65) cyber security kits.\n\nThe Navy increased the AIS program budget to begin design\/integration efforts to field the AIS capability on Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) mission capable Ohio class Ship, Submersible, Ballistic, Nuclear (SSBN) submarines.   The need for AIS system is especially important for SSBN submarines, which have limited maneuverability during strategic patrol.  The AIS Submarine configuration provides situational awareness (to include encrypted AIS message traffic from United States Coast Guard vessels) during time constrained ascents to communications depth, thereby significantly reducing the risk of a close-aboard contact situation, impacting the already limited resource of these SSBN submarines.   \n\nAdditional funding is to implement United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) comprehensive review recommendations for adding an AIS Workstation in Combat Information Center (CIC) on surface ships and an additional AIS workstation in the Flag Plot on Force level ships. An AIS Workstation in CIC will allow AIS data to be correlated with information from other sources such as radar, resulting in improved situation awareness and mission planning capability.  Non-recurring cost associated with network and shipboard certification requirements.  Updating the AIS architecture to integrate an additional AIS workstation into the CIC and Flag Plot will include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs associated with the ship modernization process such as Engineering Change and Ship Change documentation, Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) updates, etc.  There are twenty-six (26) ship class drawings that need to be updated to detail where and how the new cyber hardening modification kits will be installed, to include how it will be mounted and interface definitions for network, power, etc.  The new cyber hardening modification to the AIS architecture requires end to end integration testing and Application Integration System Integration Test (AI SIT) network validation testing and an updated Authority to Operate (ATO)."

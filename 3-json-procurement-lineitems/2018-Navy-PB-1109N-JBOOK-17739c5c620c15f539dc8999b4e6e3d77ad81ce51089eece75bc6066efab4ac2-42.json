These shelters will be located at the following locations:  Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune, MCB Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Marine Corps Air Stations (MCAS) Yuma, MCAS Miramar, MCAS Cherry Point, and the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) 29 Palms."

This funding is foundational to meeting the intent of SecDef's Phase Two focus. Absent this temporary facilities funding, the Marine Corps will delay meeting these program balance, facilities investment, and force structure growth requirements."

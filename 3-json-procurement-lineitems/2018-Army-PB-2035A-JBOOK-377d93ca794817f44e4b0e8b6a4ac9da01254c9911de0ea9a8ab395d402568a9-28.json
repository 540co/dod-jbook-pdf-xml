            "val": "This program provides the Army, as a member of the Department of Defense (DoD) Counterintelligence (CI) community with advanced CI operational equipment to enhance Army\u2019s ability to contour the global threat through significant improvements in information sharing, common situational awareness, and knowledge management in a joint operational environment.  The Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Enterprise Capital Equipment Replacement Program (CERP), as authorized and directed under INSCOM Policy Memorandum G6-1 by the INSCOM CG on 17 February 2017, provides for the systematic Life Cycle Replacement (LCR) of INSCOM Enterprise Common Computing Infrastructure to support INSCOM business, intelligence and security mission operations. Capital Equipment Replacement Program (CERP), G6 is to replace routers, switches, storage device, printers and monitors over six years old; servers, firewalls, and workstations over five years old; and notebooks over four years old. This program also provides the Army $0.5 million, as a member of the DoD CI community with advanced CI operational equipment to enhance Army\u2019s ability to contour the global threat through significant improvements in information sharing, common situational awareness, and knowledge management in a joint operational environment."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY2018 Base Funding in the amount of $9.060 million procures Information Technology (IT) hardware purchased for INSCOM to provide IT hardware in support of INSCOM\u2019s Mission Command and INSCOM\u2019s support to the war-fighting mission.  The IT hardware provides the necessary equipment for INSCOM personnel to perform daily and necessary Intelligence Community (IC) support.  Without this IT hardware, INSCOM personnel will not be able to execute IC business, intelligence, security and mission operations. Centralized consolidation and management of INSCOM Enterprise CERP provides increased infrastructure standardization, reduced management overhead, and significant cost avoidance. \n\nFY2018 Base Funding in the amount of $0.5 million procures the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) - compliant CI and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) material solutions to support implementation of case management, threat management information systems, and information processing systems at Service, Major Command (MACOM) and user level Army Intelligence sites.  Funding further provides specialized equipment necessary to support worldwide CI operations and investigation missions."

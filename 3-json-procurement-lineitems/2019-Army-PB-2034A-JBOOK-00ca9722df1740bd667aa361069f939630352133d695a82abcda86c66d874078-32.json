            "val": "The Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) program reuses idle capacity at active and inactive Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Army Ammunition Plants and the GOCO Hawthorne Army Depot through commercialization.  Congress enacted this program in the FY 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Public Law (PL) 102-484) and codified in FY 2000 (10 U.S.C. 4551-4555).  ARMS resources are used for facility strategic reuse plans, marketing plans, building renovation and recapitalization, equipment purchase, relocation, or consolidation, as well as environmental baseline studies and site surveys to encourage commercial use of underutilized Army assets.  The ARMS objectives include sustaining critical manufacturing capabilities and critical skills; reducing facility operating and maintenance costs; decreasing product cost; providing opportunities for small business; and accelerating private sector economic development, employment and investment.  The ARMS program allows the Army to manage portions of the ammunition infrastructure as a commercial business.  This management concept has allowed the Army to apply overhead costs across multiple commercial contracts to reduce operating costs."

The ARMS program reduces Army cost of ownership and maintains critical munitions industrial base skills.  Revenues collected will be utilized to reduce overhead and total annual operating costs, improve and maintain existing buildings for current tenants, and perform improvements to other vacant buildings to entice potential tenants."

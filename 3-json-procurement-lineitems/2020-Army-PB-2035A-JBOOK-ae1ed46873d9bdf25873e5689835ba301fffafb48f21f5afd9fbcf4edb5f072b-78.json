CPI2 will provide expeditionary, survivable and scalable command post infrastructure to accomplish its mission across the range of military operations (ROMO); offensive, defensive, stability operations and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). The program office intends to integrate information and support systems into formation appropriate platforms (vehicles) to provide mobile command post infrastructure and capabilities, which are intended to enhance survivability and agility while allowing the commander to tailor the command post configuration based on the mission.\n\nThe CPI2 Materiel Development Decision Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 21 June 2018, and directs CPI2 to be executed in a two increment approach. Increment 1 will develop capabilities to address needs identified in the signed Command Post (CP) Directed Requirement (DR) while Increment 2 will execute requirements as identified in the emerging CP Capability Development Document (CDD)."

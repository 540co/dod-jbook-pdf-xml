The budget request supports the following efforts:\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT TRAINING SYSTEM (TCTS):\nThe TCTS program will procure fixed, transportable and mobile range equipment for the Navy for both shore-based (aircrew training) and deployable (ship\/aircrew training) applications.  TCTS instrumentation will transmit and track instrumented exercise participants and events (e.g., weapons engagements), and provide accurate, realistic, and timely exercise feedback.  TCTS is building on technology developed for existing tactical training range systems.  Increment I procurement primarily acquires airborne instrumentation Participant Subsystems (PS) for F\/A-18 and other tactical aircraft via Airborne Subsystems (AS).  Beginning in FY 2021, Increment II will procure new PS to provide encryption capability for Fleet training exercises. Increment II will also deliver encrypted Rack-mounted Subsystem (RS) for Rotary and Transport Aircraft."

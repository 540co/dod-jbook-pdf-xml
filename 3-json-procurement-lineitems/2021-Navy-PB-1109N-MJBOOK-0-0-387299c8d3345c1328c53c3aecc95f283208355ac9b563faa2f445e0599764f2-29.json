            "val": "Communications Security (COMSEC):  COMSEC is the USMC Commodities Management Office (CMO) providing support for installations and designated acquisition program COMSEC requirements, intermediate logistics, and configuration management. COMSEC provides support for Protected Secure Voice and Data transmissions, Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), the National Security Agency (NSA) directed Cryptographic Modernization of the COMSEC infrastructure, Installations (base, posts, and station), and platforms. COMSEC CMO ensures the protection of Marine Corps and Joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack. Cyberspace systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, Information Technology (IT) systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein.  Rapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. COMSEC CMO provides the Warfighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.\n\nJoint Communications Support Element (JCSE):  Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., rapidly delivers secure, reliable, and scalable command, control, communications, and computer capabilities (C4) ranging from small mobile team missions to full Joint task force headquarters (JTF HQ) deployments.  \n\nCombat Data Network (CDN) (formerly Tactical Data Network (TDN) Data Distribution System - Modular (DDS-M)):  The CDN provides the commander a modular, integrated, and interoperable Internet Protocol (IP) - based Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) capability that forms the data communications backbone to tactical organizations within a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The CDN provides an extension of the Defense Information System Network (DISN), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) as well as a coalition networking. The CDN provides Marine Corps maneuver elements with a modular and scalable IP data transport capability by providing computers, servers, routers, data switches, cabling, multiple connections to various tactical transmission devices, contains integral In-line Network Encryption (INE) device supporting IP Security (IPSec), and Virtual Private Networking (VPN). CDN also provides software support for email, telephone, and internet services while in a tactical environment. CDN is currently designated as the Common Hosting Environment (CHE) for tactical networking. CHE will consolidate like capabilities from various programs of record, primarily server capacity and network access switching, under a single program of record. CHE will simplify the equipment string and will help reduce the overall Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements for the MAGTF. In FY21 the Combat Operations Center (COC) requirements transitions into the Combat Data Network (CDN) program under the title Common Hosting Environment (CHE).\n\nTactical Voice Switching System (TVSS):  The TVSS is a modular Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) circuit switch capable system that provides Voice Over Internet Protocol telecommunications, multiplexing, transmission encryption, and group modem capabilities in one system for tactical telephony voice communications.  TVSS is reaching end of life and is planned to be removed from the fleet inventory by the end of FY21."

FY19 funds supported technology refresh Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), procurement, and fielding for various CDN equipment. 3.1 Program Spt\/Fielding\/CLS\/Training funds supported management, acquisition, logistics, manpower support, personnel, and training analysis as well as training plan development and associated support.  3.3 ECP Network Equipment funds supported procurement of the Local Area Network (LAN) Services Module (Routers).  3.4 Small Form Factor funds supported procurement of additional quantities of Small Form Factor equipment to reduce size, weight, and power (SWaP). 3.9 ECP Network Equipment funds supported procurement of the Local Area Network (LAN) Services Module (Routers) for Reserve Units.  3.10 Small Form Factor (Reserve) funds supported procurement of additional quantities of Small Form Factor equipment to reduce size, weight, and power (SWaP) for Reserve Units. \n\nFY 2020: $23.781M ($19.282M Active, $4.499M Reserves)\n\nCOMSEC: $1.250M ($0.987M Active, $0.263M Reserves). Funding continues to procure replacement components for damaged COMSEC equipment, ancillary devices, and program support for product verification\/validation testing.\n\nJCSE: $0.491M. Funds the Marine Corps mandated share of efforts to keep the JCSE equipped with the latest state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish its Joint Staff Mission. The specific purpose will be determined at the annual JCSE modernization review.\n\nCDN: $22.040M ($17.804M Active, $4.236M Reserves). FY20 funds support technology refresh Engineering Change Proposals, procurement and fielding for various parts of the CDN equipment family. The Small Form Factor activities in FY20 include the execution of material optional contract line items based on the FY19 procurement engineering effort.  Additionally, Small Form Factor funds (active\/reserve) support the procurement of additional quantities of Small Form Factor equipment to reduce size, weight, and power (SWaP).  ECP Network Equipment funds support the procurement of routers.  ECP Network Equipment (Reserves) funds support the procurement of hardware associated with the technology refresh cycle which upgrades the equipment every three to five years.\n\nFY 2021 Base Appropriation Request: $40.627M ($32.564M Active, $8.063M Reserves)\n\nCOMSEC: $1.283M ($1.031M Active, $0.252M Reserves). The increase of $0.047M from FY20 to FY21 supports COMSEC modernization and Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) upgrades to currently fielded assets. FY21 funds will continue to support COMSEC modernization and Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) upgrades to currently fielded assets, in support of Expeditionary Force 21 and National Security Agency guidelines.  Additionally, funding will continue to procure replacements for COMSEC equipment, ancillary devices, and program support for product verification\/validation testing.\n\nJCSE: Active, $0.552M ($0.501M Active, $0.051M Reserves). The increase of $0.0610M from FY20 to FY21 reflects the Marine Corps mandated share of efforts to keep the JCSE equipped with the latest state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish its Joint Staff Mission. The specific purpose will be determined at the annual JCSE modernization review.\n\nCDN: $38.792M ($31.032M Active, $7.760M Reserves). The increase of $16.752M from FY20 to FY21 supports the procurement of network switches.  There is a more robust requirement moving forward to ensure up-to-date, effective equipment with the absorption of COC equipment and requirements into the Common Hosting Environment (CHE) underneath CDN.  Specifically, FY21 funds will support technology refresh Engineering Change Proposals, procurement, and fielding for various parts of the CDN equipment family. 3.1 Program Support\/Fielding\/Contractor Logistics Support\/Training funds will support management, acquisition, logistics, manpower support, personnel, and training analysis as well as training plan development and associated support.  3.3 ECP Network Equipment funds will support procurement of the Switches, which will be a multiple year procurement across FY21 and FY22. Switches are at the end of support in FY23 and the manufacturer will no longer provide cyber security updates. The program will procure over 3,300 switches and other critical components necessary across the procurement timeline.  3.7 ECP Network Equipment (Reserves) funds will also support a multiple year procurement across FY21 and FY22 of switches and other components necessary to support the reserve component equipment set.  The program office will procure over 900 switches and other critical components."

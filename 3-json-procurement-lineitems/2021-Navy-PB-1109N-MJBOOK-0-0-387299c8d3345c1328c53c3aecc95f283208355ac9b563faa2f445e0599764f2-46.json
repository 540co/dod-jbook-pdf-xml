            "val": "The Family of Ultra-light Tactical Vehicle (FULTV), which consists of the Utility Task Vehicle (UTV) and the future Ultra-light Tactical Vehicle (ULTV), provides operational capabilities for both infantry logistics and long-range surveillance and reconnaissance missions in support of distributed heliborne operations.  The vehicles are transportable in the V-22, CH53E and CH53F tilt selected rotary and fixed wing aircraft.  The FULTV vehicles mitigate the infantry and reconnaissance battalion support gaps, with the ability to operate in remote, rural regions where currently fielded ground mobility platforms may be unsuitable due to size, weight, and transportability concerns.\n\nThe UTV is a part of the family of vehicles that supports the Fleet Marine Forces by providing infantry and reconnaissance battalions with a reliable, easily maintained, inexpensive vehicle that supports the range of military operations (ROMO) including distributed operations (DO), littoral operation in a contested environment (LOCE), expeditionary advanced based operations (EABO), and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR). \n\nEfforts are being planned to replace the UTV with the Ultra-light Tactical Vehicle (ULTV). The replacement vehicle will leverage technology upgrades to improve the operational capabilities for both infantry logistics and long-range intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well as other designated missions in support of distributed heliborne operations. The desired outcomes from ULTV employment include but are not limited to, a lighter, faster, more maneuverable and more resilient force, increased ability to operate and be sustained in austere environments, reduced operational risk through reduced logistics footprint and threat exposure, and an increased autonomy and tactical mobility, particularly at the company-level and below.\n\nThe FULTV line item will provide for the implementation of engineering change proposals, safety initiatives, and quality design resolutions to fielded UTVs. This hands-on method ensures proper in-service management and vehicle sustainment while allowing the program office to develop and implement improvements as needed to respond to evolving requirements of the Marine Corps that affect vehicle reliability, safety, availability and readiness. The ULTVs will begin to replace the UTVs in FY22, which is a change from the FY20 request, which provided for procurement beginning in FY21.  Safety and reliability modifications are planned throughout the life of the FULTV's to ensure maximum readiness as vehicles age."

            "val": "FY 2019: $0.606M\n\nFunding provided product improvements to the centrally managed UTV fleet for safety and reliability issues and engineering change proposals. The funds supported the associated update of the technical documentation upon modification of the vehicles. \n\nFY 2020:  $0.647M\nFunding provides product improvement to the centrally managed UTV fleet for safety and reliability issues and engineering change proposals like  wheel well protection.  These engineering change proposals will improve operational readiness by reducing failure rates associated with the mentioned safety and reliability issues.\n\nFY 2021 Base Appropriation Request: $0.678M\nFunding provides product improvement to the centrally managed UTV fleet for safety and reliability issues and engineering change proposals like high clearance trailing arms and control arms.  These engineering change proposals will improve operational readiness by reducing failure rates associated with the mentioned safety and reliability issues.\n\nThe increase of $0.031M will be used for additional engineering change proposals required to ensure vehicle safety, reliability and enhanced performance associated with the aging UTV fleet."

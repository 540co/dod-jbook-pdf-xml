            "val": "The KC-46 will provide the capability to fuel joint and coalition receivers via a boom or drogue system on every mission and will also augment the airlift fleet with cargo, passenger, and aeromedical evacuation capabilities. The KC-46 will operate in day\/night and adverse weather conditions to enable deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of U.S. joint, allied, and coalition forces. The KC-46 will have communication, navigation, and surveillance equipment for world-wide operations; the capability to perform missions in chemical and biological environments; the ability to operate in up to medium threat environments with self-defense\/protection (both active and passive) capabilities; and the necessary battle space awareness to mitigate survivability threats.\n\nJustification:\nFY 2018 funding consists of the integration of Service Bulletins (SBs)\/Airworthiness Directives (ADs) and other reported issues to correct identified deficiencies, provide product improvements, and maintain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification compliance for the aircraft.\n\nFunding for FY 2018 is a New Start.\n\nOther modifications to the KC-46 through the FYDP include R&M and Safety Mods, Pegasus Combat Capability (PC2) (M-Code Global Positioning System (GPS), Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT) Block Upgrade (BU), and Oxygen Bottles), SBs\/ADs, and Low Cost Mods (LCMs).\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401221F."

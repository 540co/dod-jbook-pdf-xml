The M32A1 LHMBC communicates digitally on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  The M32A2 communicates digitally on the newly fielded Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Fire Support Network. Both the M32A1 and M32A2 LHMBC versions provide firing computations for all calibers of mortars as well as digital messaging capability.  The M32A1 LHMBC will utilize the Ruggedized Tactical Handheld Device (RTHD) platform and will be compatible with Common Operating Environment (COE) 1.0 compliance.  The M32A2 LHMBC will utilize Nett Warrior (NW) Mobile\/Handheld (M\/HH) platform and will be compatible with COE 3.0 compliance."

            "val": "Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) is a war reserve item used both in training and combat.  FY 2018 request supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with Army procurement goals.  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $8.117 million supports the procurement of 497 each M32A2 LHMBC Nett Warrior (NW) computers and Basic Issue Items (BII).  The M32A2 LHMBC NW with COE Version 3.0 software is urgently needed to replace the obsolete M32 Ruggedized Personal Digital Assistance (RPDA) computers in the field.  LHMBC eliminates the need of paper firing table, improves the accuracy of mortar ballistic calculation, and increases survivability of mortar crews by digitally connecting to the Fire Support network to receive fire missions and Fire Support Coordination Measures to conduct fratricide check.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

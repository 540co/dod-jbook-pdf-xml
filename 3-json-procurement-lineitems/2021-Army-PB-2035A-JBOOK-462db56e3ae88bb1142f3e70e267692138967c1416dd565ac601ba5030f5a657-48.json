            "val": "The Army Program of Record (POR) for biometrics tactical collection capability is the Biometrics Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A).  The BAT-A system consists of the BAT-A Kit with peripherals, BAT-A Handheld, BAT-A Servers, and BAT.Web.  The BAT-A system is a biometric identity tool that collects, matches, stores, shares biometric signatures (fingerprints, iris, and face) and contextual data on known & suspected terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals to inform analysis and decision-making.  BAT-A provides the Biometrically-Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) to the Warfighter enabling credible and reliable identity capabilities.  Biometric data collected from the BAT-A system is shared across the DoD, U.S. government agencies, and with Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A system was originally a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been supporting oversea contingency operations for over 19 years.  BAT-A is currently deployed across 5 combatant commands as well as in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel, Operation Inherent Resolve, and JTF Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement for the Biometrics Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A) Program of Record (POR) which has been supporting overseas contingency operations for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC supports all three objectives of the National Defense to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices.  NXGBCC initiates the data flow to the DoD Authoritative Biometrics Identification System (ABIS) and Military Intelligence systems.  NXGBCC consists of an expeditionary biometric data management system called the Local Trusted Source (LTS), biometric static collection kits with palm and credential badge capability, and biometric mobile collection kits.  NXGBCC will tactically collect, match, store, reference, and share biometric signatures and contextual data while providing data analysis capability at all echelons; enabling forces in competition, armed conflict, and re-competing in a Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) environment.  NXGBCC processes Enemy Prisoners of War (EPWs), Displaced Persons, and Refugees.  It also assists Operations in the Support in Consolidation Areas.  NXGBCC enables commanders to protect their force, deny enemy movement, increase freedom of maneuver, protect civilian populations, manage detainees identities, and to defeat near-peer unconventional threats."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement in the amount of $0.999 million for NXGBCC will procure 65 mobile kits, 25 static kits, and 2 palm scanners for use at the Combat Training Centers (CTCs) as training devices.  It will also procure the NXGBCC software licenses and sustainment contract labor.\n\nFY 2021 OCO procurement in the amount of $.537 million continues to procure BAT-A Kit hardware and BAT-A Handheld accessories for RESET\/REFRESH activities supporting overseas contingency operations.  Requested funds will refresh BAT-A Scanner Devices (45 Fingerprint and 45 Iris); 75 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A HH parts and accessories ensuring the availability of this mission critical capability.  The remaining $11.8 million of FY 2021 OCO procurement will procure NXGBCC devices (645 mobile kits and 180 static kits) to replace BAT-A Theater Provided Equipment (TPE).  It will also provide software licenses, sustainment contact labor, engineering support, and deployment logistics.\n\nIn accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110 - 181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

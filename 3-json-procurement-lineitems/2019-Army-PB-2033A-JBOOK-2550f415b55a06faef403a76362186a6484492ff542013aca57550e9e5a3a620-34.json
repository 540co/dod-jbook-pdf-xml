Initial buys of items to support or meet operational needs and lighten sniper load. It includes the procurement of rifle scope optics, spotting scopes, an accompanying Accessory Interface Mounting kit (AIM), and improved capabilities including an enhanced Army common mil-radian reticle pattern to recognize and engage targets at longer ranges and lower light levels increasing hit probability. This program also provides improved ancillary equipment such as intelligent rails, ballistic chronographs, Ballistic Weather Meter (BWM), light weight barrels, fire controls, muzzles with suppressors, other components, and support costs. The current army fleet of sniper weapons, consisting of the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (EBR) as interim Squad Designated Marksman weapon, the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS), the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle (ESR), and the M107 Semi-Automatic Long Range Sniper Rifle (LRSR), require continuous upgrades to the weapon, components, and\/or ancillary equipment. Sniper upgrades seek to enhance sniper mission capability, effectiveness, and survivability by extending the sniper's influence through emerging technologies in perfecting ballistics with exacting hardware and precise calculations, reducing sniper team burden through decreased weight and enhanced ergonomics, portability, signature-reduction, faster more precise target reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and precision aiming with automated ballistic prediction systems. Upgrades also support sniper\/spotter mission collaboration with information sharing of targets and better situational awareness."

Continued support for modifications of the M110 SASS, M2010 ESR, and M107 LRSR Modifications. These studies, modifications, and upgrades provide a more full-spectrum and versatile suite of sniper rifles that improves ergonomics, survivability, capability, and portability without sacrificing performance, accuracy and reliability. Efforts also include evaluation and\/or validation of any proposed ECP's regarding sniper optics and any ancillary equipment enhancements that can include performing engineering studies to investigate the proposed enhancements and also to procure samples for evaluation.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

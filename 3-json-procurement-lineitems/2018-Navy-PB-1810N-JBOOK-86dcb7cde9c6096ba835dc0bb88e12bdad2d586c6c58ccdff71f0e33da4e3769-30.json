            "val": "Beginning in FY 2017, effort continues in OPN Line Item 2830, Afloat ATC Equipment\n\nThe Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) provides the primary precision electronic guidance for landing aircraft under all weather conditions on CVNs, LHAs, LHDs and selected Naval Air Stations.  Many of the components in the system have been in service for more than twenty years.  This program funds maintainability, reliability and supportability improvements to existing equipment components that can no longer be maintained and supported, as well as items providing upgraded operational capability.  AN\/SPN-46 Life Cycle Extension (LCE) sustainment efforts will be supplemented with other changes, as necessary, to offset obsolescence and supportability issues, the need for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) refresh, and to support system interface requirements.  LCE efforts include Radar Control Group Unit 19, Embedded Global Positioning System and Inertial Navigation System (EGI) replacement, Computer Group replacement, Radar Receiver set replacement, Peripheral Display replacement, and Common Console replacement efforts.  AN\/SPN-41 LCE sustainment efforts will be supplemented with other changes, as necessary, to offset obsolescence and supportability issues and to support systems interface requirements.  Additionally, the AN\/SPN-41 system is the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) back-up system.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Agent:  Shipyards and Alteration Installation Teams (AITs).\nShips or facilities to receive equipment:  CVNs, LHAs, LHDs, the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA-NAWCAD, St. Inigoes), selected shore sites and the training site.\nNote:  Prior year total amount only accounts for items funded in the current FYDP."

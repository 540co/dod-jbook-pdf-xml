These funds will also support the procurement of system hardware.\n\nCOMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE) supports the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs).  The MISTCs, under the operational control of the C2 TECOE is the primary Command and Control (C2) training venue for the Marine Corps operating forces for both individual and collective C2 systems sustainment training. The yearly funding is for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems. A portion of the C2 computer systems are replaced each year to provide current systems for classroom and combat operation training in battle staff training for commanders and unit personnel.\n\nDEPLOYABLE VIRTUAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (DVTE) is a laptop PC based simulation system capable of emulating organic and supporting Infantry Battalion weapons systems and training scenarios to facilitate Training and Readiness (T&R) based training, currently being fielded at the Battalion level. Its portable configuration allows Marines to train when they otherwise could not; aboard ship, at remote reserve locations and deployed. DVTE conducts multiple types of training such as language and culture training, platoon and squad level tactics, employment of supporting arms, and various Recognition of Combatants (ROC) packages. DVTE is part of a Commander's \"training toolkit\" contributing to the building block approach to standards based training focusing on achieving an improved level of combat readiness. Funding supports hardware refresh and integration\/interoperability capabilities with operational forces' systems.\n\nFAMILY OF COMBAT VEHICLE TRAINING SYSTEM (FCVTS) consists of the active duty Marine Corps' Combat Convoy Simulator (CCS) and the Combat Vehicle Training Systems which includes the Advanced Gunnery Training System (AGTS_) for the M1A1 Abrams Tank and Light Armored Vehicle - 25 (LAV-25), and the Amphibious Assault Vehicle Turret Training (AAV-TT).  The CCS provides an immersive training environment in which Marines exercise combat skills including tactics, techniques and procedures for vehicle convoy operations in a variety of simulated road, terrain, weather, visibility and operational conditions.  Tactical scenarios include weapons usage, target engagement, driver evasive action, vehicle coordination command and control procedures, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) defeat, and calls for fire, close air support and medical evacuation.  The Combat Vehicle Training System (CVTS) provides full-fidelity, computer-based training systems for the M1A1 main battle tank, the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) 25, and the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) vehicles. It provides full crew training without the need for fuel, ammunition, training areas and ranges. Training systems can be linked together allowing for section and platoon level training. Procurement funding supports technology refresh. \n\nFORCE ON FORCE TRAINING SYSTEMS (FoFTS) provides realistic, non-live fire capabilities to perform force-on-force training and supports realistic, live fire force-on-target training. The program develops, fields and supports a suite of tactical engagement capabilities that enhance MAGTF training around the world and across the range of military operations. The program includes tactical training systems such as the Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) and advanced, instrumented, laser-based tactical engagement systems such as the Instrumented-Tactical Engagement Simulation System (I-TESS) that provide realistic weapons effects, position locating, and enhanced After Action Review (AAR) capability to support Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) events in the MAGTF Training Program curriculum. Funding supports procurement of company sets of I-TESS training systems required to meet AAO.\n\nIMMERSIVE TRAINING RANGE SUPPORT (ITRS) [FORMERLY SQUAD IMMERSIVE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (SITE)] will provide II Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) an outdoor Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) that will consist of small unit training ranges with urban structures finished and decorated to replicate geo-specific locations paired with integrated direct fire training systems, virtual simulation screens, and video instrumentation for after action review.  The outdoor training environments closely replicate current operational threats by stimulating all senses to stress small unit actions and the small unit leader's tactical, moral, and ethical decision making within the context of operational culture.  IIT provides the capability for small-unit rehearsal training and squad leader decision making for assessment and measurement.  The immersive training environment seeks to suspend disbelief by closely replicating the actual operating environment, including realistic battlefield friendly and enemy effects to the level of fidelity that the perceived difference between the actual operational environment and immersive training environment is nearly indistinguishable to the training audience.  This high-level of battlefield realism provides training exposure to operational complexities, mental and physical stressors, and tactical and ethical decision-making in a culturally accurate, threat accurate, and interactive environment.\n\nINDOOR SIMULATED MARKSMANSHIP TRAINER (ISMT) is a three (3) dimensional simulation based trainer for indoor use, capable of instructing in basic and advanced marksmanship, shoot\/no-shoot judgment, combat marksmanship, and weapons employment tactics. The ISMT is used for remedial, virtual instruction to augment live fire upon simulated targets with an indication of the rounds fired.  The ISMT systems are used both within the continental United States (CONUS) and Outside CONUS (OCONUS).  The system has five (5) firing positions and is capable of operating simulated weapons such as AT4, M2 .50 Cal, M9, M16A4, M16A2 Fully Sensored, M240G, M240B, M203, MK19, MP5, M249 SAW, M870 12 gauge shotgun, SMAW, M224 60mm Mortar, M252 81mm Mortar, M4A1, Joint Services Combat Shotgun (JSCS, M67 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR), M32 Multi-shot Grenade Launcher, and the M72 Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW).\n\nMARINE AIR GROUND TASK FORCE (MAGTF)TACTICAL WARFARE SIMULATION (MTWS) is the Marine Corps' only constructive, aggregate-level simulation system used to support the training of Marine commanders and their battle staffs in MAGTF war-fighting principles\/concepts and associated command and control procedures.  Using complex computer-simulated behavior models, MTWS provides an interactive, decision-based, real-time, war game representing the six war-fighting functional areas of fires, command and control, force protection, logistics, maneuver, and intelligence.  It's modeling breadth and flexibility enables users to represent and exercise a wide variety of combat scenarios to prepare leaders to face the military challenges of today's world.  MTWS is designed to support the training of commanders and their staffs in exercises involving live and simulated land, air, and naval forces at all operational command levels.  The system supports all levels of command throughout the MEF and Joint Task Force (JTF).  MTWS can be used as a multi-sided war game, including red, blue, civilian, and non-aligned sides.  The system can also be used to validate specific operational plans against a variety of enemy and environmental situations.  Thus command personnel may examine alternative tactical solutions on a \"what if\" basis.\n\nMARINE CORPS DISTANCE LEARNING Program (MCDLP) - provides the MarineNet E-Learning Infrastructure that enables Marines to receive training and education via interactive media, when and where training is needed. DL contributes to the Marine Corps' operational readiness by providing Marines with access to required Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), ommon skills training and Professional Military Education (PME) training at 40 Learning Resource Centers (LRCs) located at Marine Corps bases and stations both CONUS and OCONUS.\n\nRANGES AND TRAINING AREA MANAGEMENT (RTAM) Baseline program modernizes major USMC base and station live training ranges to provide enhanced after action review with ground truth feedback, realistic representation of Opposing Forces (OPFOR) and enhanced range and exercise command and control capabilities. Integrating live and simulated training technologies, the fielded capabilities enhance live-fire, force-on-target, GUAM initiatives, and force-on-force training. Major system components of modernization include Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) facilities, inter-active targetry, battlefield effects simulators, individual and vehicle tracking systems, aviation tracking systems, Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems, simulated munitions, integrated simulation, and range control and exercise control information processing and situational awareness displays. Training is required to support the complexities of command and control, live-fire coordination in support of maneuver, and logistics operations in support of units at and above company level. Deploying operational units need access to instrumented, non live-fire and live-fire capable MOUT training facilities, urban sniper training capabilities, convoy operation\/reaction course capability, Urban Close Air Support (CAS) ranges, and IED\/EOD training capability in order to accomplish this training and bring the Marine Corps into the 21st century, to include a fully Immersive Infantry Trainer (IIT). These capabilities give deploying units the opportunity to better meet training requirements before exercising as a MAGTF and deploying to the combat theaters. Additionally lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) are driving the need for new training systems supporting a seamless training environment allowing crucial core capabilities to be available for all Marines at all sites at once.\n\nSUPPORTING ARMS VIRTUAL TRAINER (SAVT) will advance the training capability, operational readiness, and tactical proficiency of USMC Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACS), Forward Observers (FOs), and Forward Air Controllers (FACs).

The $1.750M decrease from FY 18 to FY 19 is due to hardware refresh schedule and realignment of funds to align with these schedules.  The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $1.0 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nCOMMAND and CONTROL TRAINING and EDUCATION CENTER of EXCELLENCE (C2 TECOE) $0.413M will provide the procurement funding support for equipment refresh and procurement of new training systems at the five (5) MAGTF Integrated Systems Training Centers (MISTCs).  Decrease of $.103 from FY 18 to FY19 is based on the hardware refresh schedule.\n\nDEPLOYABLE VIRTUAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENT (DVTE) $.947M will provide procurement funding support for the new phase of the hardware refresh of DVTE suites which will be accomplished over the next four (4) years (2017 to 2020). The decrease of $1.591M is due to smaller allotments numbers of DVTE systems at the locations being refreshed during FY19 and also due to a realignment of funding to align with the updated refresh schedule. The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $0.50 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nFORCE ON FORCE TRAINING SYSTEM (FoFTS) $20.942M will allow procurement of additional sets of Instrumented-Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (I-TESS) to support large scale battalion and joint level training exercises with enhanced instrumentation systems for Armored vehicles and Crew Served Weapons. The increase of $13.486M from FY18 to FY19 procures Mobile Fire Support Trainers (MFST), Combat Vehicle Tactical Engagement Simulator System (CV-TESS) kits for LAV, M1A1, ACV, AAV variants, and additional systems to support the fielding of Tactical Decision Kits (TDK).\n\nINDOOR SIMULATED MARKSMANSHIP TRAINER (ISMT) $2.673M will provide for the hardware refresh procurement of simulated weapons such as AT4, M2 .50 Cal, M9, M16A4, M16A2 Fully Sensored, M240G, M240B, M203, MK19, MP5, M249 SAW, M870 12 gauge shotgun, SMAW, M224 60mm Mortar, M252 81mm Mortar, M4A1, Joint Services Combat Shotgun (JSCS, M67 Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR), M32 Multi-shot Grenade Launcher, and the M72 Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW) and to modify and alter the ISMT space aboard the LPD Class 17 platform to baseline\/backfit the compartments layout. Decrease from FY18 to FY19 in the amount of $5.485M is due to a reduction in the number of simulated weapons requiring refresh.\n\nMARINE AIR GROUND TASK FORCE (MAGTF) TACTICAL WARFARE SIMULATION (MTWS) $0.752M will provide hardware\/software refresh in accordance with four-year refresh cycle. Decrease of $.152M from FY 18 to FY19 is based on the hardware refresh schedule.\n\nMARINE CORPS DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM (MCDLP) $0.875M will provide hardware, technical support and testing for the disaster recovery site for MarineNet and purchase yearly software license renewals.  Decrease from FY18 to FY19 in the amount of $1.821M is due to having the Continuity of Operations (COOP) move from MCEITS to Amazon Government Cloud based solution.\n\nRANGES AND TRAINING AREA MANAGEMENT $22.476M will allow for procurement of training systems and devices that support multiple ranges at various locations such as inter-active targetry, battlefield effects simulators, individual and vehicle tracking systems, and aviation tracking systems for live fire and non-live fire training ranges at the MAGTFTC and home station commands which is based on priorities established by Training & Education Command Range & Training Area Management division.  The $2.998M increase in funds from FY18 to FY19 provides funding support for Expeditionary Operations Training Group (EOTG) Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS) training systems.  The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $2.529 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nTRAINING SIMULATIONS SUPPORT (TSS) $0.053M provides minimum procurement of low density, minor (low cost) MAGTF ground training equipment, simulators and simulations. These devices such as medical training kits, bleeding simulation kits, weapons models and mockups, enhance basic occupational and combat skills across the wide spectrum of tactics, techniques, procedures and proficiency.  Funding provides capability for the USMC to conduct critical training and participate as a full-fledged member of several Joint programs.  FY19 will provide minimal continued support for a determined combination of minor low cost ground training equipment, simulators and simulations.  The $.500M decrease from FY 18 to FY 19 is reduction to support procurement of only the minimal high priority low cost TSS devices.\n\nOCO: \nFY2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): N\/A\nFY2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): N\/A"

It provides area access and freedom of movement for the Commander.  SREHD consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads, consisting of detection, marking, and neutralization payloads, are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  This capability allows a soldier to remain in a protective posture while detecting and neutralizing a wide variety of hybrid and conventional explosive threats.  This item is code B, approved for restricted use.\n\n The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for SREHD is 173."

            "val": "The Army National Guard (ARNG) requires its existing older High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) fleet be modernized to the current configuration.  Prior year funding supported the procurement of new M997A3 Ambulances for the ARNG; fieldings will continue through FY21.  Funding also supported vehicle upgrades that include vehicle reliability enhancements incorporated into HMMWV production during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom to allow for installation of armor packages, by inclusion of improved suspension and vehicle cooling system enhancements.  Lastly, prior year funding supported a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between AM General and Red River Army Depot (RRAD), consisting of vehicle disassembly and reassembly, application of designated mandatory replacement parts and compliance requirements, installation of Automotive Improvement Program and Reliability Enhancement Vehicle components, and Inspection and Repair Only as Necessary (IROAN) of the HMMWV cab.  The cab was then integrated onto a new production rolling chassis to include a new engine, engine cooling system, transmission, and suspension system. \n\nThis current modernization effort consists of procuring new production, armor-capable HMMWVs for the ARNG to address their aging fleet and to reduce obsolescence burden.  The new production program procures new production armor capable HMMWVs to modernize Modification Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) units.  This allows for the divestiture of non-armored HMMWVs that currently pose readiness challenges and cannot be up-armored.  This aligns with the Army's current modernization path while also addressing identified model mix gaps.\n\nCongress added $60.0M in FY 2016 funds for this program for HMMWV Ambulance that was realigned to SSN D15406, Ambulance, 4 Litter, 5\/4 Ton 4X4."

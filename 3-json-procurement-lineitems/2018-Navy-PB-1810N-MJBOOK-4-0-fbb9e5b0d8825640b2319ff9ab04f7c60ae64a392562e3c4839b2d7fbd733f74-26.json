        "Description": {
            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is the acquisition approach and contract vehicle used to manage the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) enterprise network which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy (DoN). Additionally NGEN provides security for the non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  NIPRNET is a private IP network used to exchange unclassified information, including information subject to controls on distribution, among the private network's users.  SIPRNET is a system of interconnected computer networks used to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the \"completely secure environment.\"  NGEN forms the foundation for the DoN's future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense-provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services.  \n\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature will be called the Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS beginning in FY18, realigning funding from 8161 to 8164.  NMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract. This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model.\n\n[P5 \/ NGEN - Technical Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP)]: Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP):  TRMP is a requirement performed by Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) which focuses on upgrading the existing Hardware and or Software to mitigate End of Life, End of Support and End of Software Support issues in order to maintain network performance, Architecture\/Solution Accreditations and network security.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H\/W and\/or S\/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS and ORT) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.\n\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature will be called Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS in FY18.  NMCI OCONUS is a DoN initiative to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end information and telecommunication services to OCONUS Navy shore commands by using a common computing environment for both the NIPRNet and SIPRNet. NMCI OCONUS will provide the infrastructure and cyber security measures to support the OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net), and the operations of ONE-Net. NMCI OCONUS also includes ONE-Net installations supporting the presidential directed initiative for Ballistic Missile Defense Aegis Ashore capability in designated countries (e.g. Romania, Poland), as well as Piers IT infrastructure to support connectivity for Naval ships world-wide at pier side (CONUS and OCONUS).  ONE-Net will continue operating under the government owned\/government operated (GO\/GO) business model and will transition to the NGEN GO\/CO support structure and operating model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract in FY18.  Consequently, the NGEN TRMP funding will be used to refresh the common global Naval Enterprise Network (combined NGEN CONUS and OCONUS).\n\n[P5 \/ NGEN - Operation Rolling Tide \/ Cyber Resiliency]: Operation Rolling Tide (ORT) is an initiative developed in response to the on-going improvement of the Navy Marine Corps Intranet security posture through the following mechanisms:  Account Hardening, Server\/Workstation Hardening, Network Compartmentalization, Network Management Enhancements, Application Protection Enhancements, Security Analysis and Fusion Capabilities, Cyber Situational Awareness (Cyber Sensor Grid) Improvements, Cyber Terrain Mapping, and Cyber Terrain Hardening.  The ORT projects will result in a more robust and secure network with the goal of better real time detection and response to any malicious activity.  In FY18 and beyond, ORT will be integrated into the ongoing Cyber Resiliency program and will compliment key Cyber initiatives such as CYBERSAFE, Risk Management Framework (RMF), Navy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE) as the network migrates toward a Cloud operating model, as well as refreshed as a part of TRMP.\n\n[P5 \/ NGEN- Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS)]: The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations.  JRSS will replace the existing Navy cyber protection boundaries allowing for a common and operable cyber defense network across all of the DoD."

            "val": "NMCI OCONUS (BLII) funding was realigned from LI 8161 to 8164 beginning in FY18 and incorporated into the Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) line.\n\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature from LI 8161, will be called the Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS.  \n\nNMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy Pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract.  This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model in conjunction with the current Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) network.  In essence, the CONUS and OCONUS networks are intended to merge into a single allocated baseline as part of the NGEN Re-compete contract.  \n\nNMCI OCONUS funding will provide technical refresh of existing antiquated network equipment allowing for the refresh of 2,000+ network devices that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network, along with 9,000+ antiquated PCs which will be at the end of their warranty.  It will also provide the required systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NMCI.  This will result in a fully integrated, navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach.  Additionally FY18 funding will be used to upgrade existing End of Life (EOL) infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, etc.) for one CONUS PIERS region (Atlantic Southeast) and two OCONUS PIERS locations (Korea and Singapore).  This technical refresh will also allow for the transition of the OCONUS Enterprise Pier Connectivity Architecture, into a single global network under the next NGEN contract.\n\nTechnology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) involves the modernization and periodic replacement of NMCI hardware\/software and assigned non-IT assets identified in the NGEN TRMP plan required to support network performance.  The objective of TRMP is to improve and maintain network performance, increase network capacity based on project demand, improve security posture from vulnerabilities and integrate DoD and\/or DoN mandates.  NGEN assets are Government Owned\/Contractor Operated (GO\/CO).  A significant  amount of those assets have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported by the vendors, which makes our infrastructure vulnerable to external cyber-attacks; and diminishes enterprise solutions performance and optimization.  Our current infrastructure is aged and modernization is essential to improve storage capabilities to accommodate new emerging workforce requirements; maintain network performance, architecture\/solution accreditations, and network security.  The procurement of these assets will continue in FY18 and beyond.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H\/W and\/or S\/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS and ORT) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.Hence, future TRMP funding will be utilized to transition to 10GB networks.  The final phase of ORT cybersecurity enhancements were procured in FY16 for deployment in FY17.  Therefore, beginning in FY18, previously deployed ORT components that become obsolete will be refreshed as part of TRMP to maintain the security posture of the network, which will become part of the baseline for the follow-on NGEN contract.  New and advanced cyber security efforts, not included in the NGEN Re-compete baseline, will leverage Cyber Resiliency funding.  \n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) scope which included JRSS was laid out broadly in a series of Joint Chiefs of Staff Tank and Deputy Secretary Management Action Group (DMAG) decisions in 2012.  DoD CIO, via the JIE EXCOM, has further refined the priorities of those tasks, consistent with the implementation strategy.  JRSS is DoD's near term modernization priority, and is fielded as an Enterprise Service, as designated by the DoD CIO in November 2015.  With the designation of JRSS as an Enterprise Service, the DoD CIO required JRSS be separately identified within the DoD FY17 President's IT Budget submission.\n\nThe funding supports the planning, engineering and movement of Navy Networks behind the Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) through firewall functionality, intrusion detection and prevention, enterprise management, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), and other network security capabilities. This OSD JRSS initiative comprises several critical Joint Information Environment capabilities including network modernization, initial implementation of a single security architecture, joint management of DoD IT security, and improvements to cyber-security situational awareness.  JRSS transforms the network security, aligning the DoD Components to a common capability, which significantly improves DoD mission effectiveness through situational awareness visibility for all echelons within DoD."

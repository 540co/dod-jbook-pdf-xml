            "val": "The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $.068 million to reflect the Department of Navy's effort to support the Office of Management and Budget directed reforms for Efficiency and Effectiveness that include a lean, accountable, more efficient government.\n\nVM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC):\nThe AN\/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) program provides increased situational awareness to the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in support of force protection, primarily in the area of ASW. Through the integration of off-board sensors and signal, data and display processors, the AN\/SQQ-34 is utilized in detecting, classifying, and localizing threats. An integrated element of the Carrier Combat System, the AN\/SQQ-34 supports the tactical deployment of embarked ASW and Surface Warfare (SUW) assets. The program provides technical refreshes to legacy AN\/SQQ-34 systems on all Carriers and shore sites in support of Fleet introduction and shipboard integration of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter. Upgrades to legacy systems will enable exchange of sensor, tactical and imagery data with the MH-60R initially and eventually with P-8 and Triton Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) aircraft. It completes the Kill Chain by linking sensor platform to sensor controllers and the ASW\/SUW commanders. In order to support multiple MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopters, the Common Data Link (CDL) will also be upgraded. CDL is the Navy Aircraft Carrier ultra wide-band, digital, secure data link, comprised of radio equipment that provides configuration-controlled and standardized wide-band, digital, and secure communication paths between multiple reconnaissance sensors and their users. Initially, a single User Interface Group (UIG) upgrade to CDL will be fielded in concert with CV-TSC\/MH-60R deployments, providing a single MH-60R\/aircraft link.\n\nVM401 - SURFACE SONAR WINDOWS AND DOMES:\nAN\/SQS-26\/53 Sonar Dome Rubber Windows (SDRW) are installed on CG47 and DDG51 class ships. This program provides emergency replacement, wire-reinforced, pressurized rubber acoustic windows and attachment hardware, which experience failure due to corrosion, fatigue, and impact damage. The SDRW significantly improves the surface ship sonar performance by reducing flow-induced self-noise and by providing increased source level receiving and sensitivity resulting from reduced attenuation. This program provides production engineering in support of technical evaluations, failure analysis, implementation of the in-water one-side backscatter X-ray program, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) refurbishments, and field service engineering; and complete engineering design work and material tests. This program also provides drawings, configuration management information, new design and fabrication technology, incorporation of lessons learned and required testing, and construct sub-element to confirm single-stage cure.\n\nVM601 - UNDERSEA WARFARE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (USW-DSS)\nUSW-DSS provides an integrated, near-real time, net-centric ASW Command and Control (C2) capability across multiple surface platforms and critical shore sites. USW-DSS provides a critical C2 capability for the Sea Combat, Theater USW (TUSW), and ASW Commanders, and enables the ability to plan and conduct USW operations, alignment of sensors for exploitation of the environment, allocation of resources, optimization of operations and risk, and vulnerability assessment. It provides USW Commanders with an expanded net-centric USW capability across CSG platforms (CVNs, CG\/DDGs, and Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS)) as well as supporting shore nodes to include Theater Surface Combatants (TSC), Training, Naval Oceanographic Processing Facility (NOPF), and Commander Task Force (CTF). This program procures and installs USW-DSS on CSG platforms and supporting shore nodes via permanent ship alterations (SHIPALTs). In FY 2009 USW-DSS transitioned to a software application hosted on the Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS) and in FY 2014 started installing as part of the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES). Workstation procurements are required to support the ISNS and CANES configured ships as well as shore nodes.  USW-DSS capability is phased to effectively deliver software improvements to the warfighter. The current software version, Build 2 Release 3 (B2R3), will continue to field until the follow-on Build 3 (B3) is fielded in FY 2019.  In FY 2021, non-recurring engineering effort will begin to field Theater Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) upgrades to USW-DSS systems, with the integrated Common Operational Picture (COP), to shore nodes operating in the multi-level security environment.\n\nYEAR-TO-YEAR BUDGET CONTROL COMPARISON:\n- FY 2017 ($7.163M) to FY 2018 ($13.653M) increase ($+6.490M) is driven by the requirement for improvements and tech refreshes of USW-DSS to avoid obsolescence and improve reliability and maintainability.  The tech refresh includes all USW-DSS\/UYQ-100 hardware Technical Insertion (TI)-08 baseline afloat and shore sites, including Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) ships, Theater commands, support nodes, and Tactical Training Equipment (TTE).\n- FY 2018 ($13.653M) to FY 2019 ($10.134M) decrease ($-3.519M) is driven by the reduced (as compared to FY 2018) requirement for the USW-DSS program's procurement of shore site, tactical trainer, and tech refresh upgrades in FY 2019.\n\n[P40A \/ VM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC)]: VM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC)\n\n[P40A \/ CV-TSC Technology Insert\/Refresh & ECP Implementation]: VM301 - CV-TSC Technology Insert\/Refresh & ECP Implementation: Consists of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and hardware\/software changes\/upgrades to previously fielded and in-production AN\/SQQ-34 systems.

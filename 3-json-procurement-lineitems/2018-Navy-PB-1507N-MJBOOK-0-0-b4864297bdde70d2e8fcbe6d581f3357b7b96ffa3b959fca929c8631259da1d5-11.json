            "val": "The AGM-65 Maverick is a tactical, air-to-surface, guided missile designed for close-air support, interdiction and defense suppression missions.  It also provides stand-off capability and high strike probability against a wide range of tactical targets, including high-speed moving targets, armor, air defenses, ships, transportation equipment and fuel storage facilities.  The AGM-65E2 is a joint effort by the Navy and Air Force to modernize this capability with an enhanced laser seeker and new software that reduces the risk of collateral damage.  The AGM-65E2 is a modification to the Maverick's Guidance and Control Section (GCS) to incorporate modern components which are a suitable replacement for the obsolete components of the existing AGM-65E."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "OCO: \nBetween FY 2000 and FY 2013 the Navy expended Laser Maverick missiles in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Between August 2014 and December 2015 additional Laser Mavericks have been expended in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  FY 2018 OCO funding will procure Laser Maverick modification kits to convert AGM-65F Infra-Red Mavericks in existing inventory to AGM-65E2 Mavericks.\n   \nAs the only existing Navy Fixed Wing Air to Ground weapon suitable for engagement of fast-moving, maneuvering ground targets, the AGM-65E Laser Maverick has been heavily expended during Global War on Terrorism (GWOT)\/OCO despite having been out of production since 1991.  This Maverick modification kit effort will address those capacity shortfalls due to a limited and rapidly diminishing Laser Maverick inventory."

            "val": "The Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS) provided common inertial survey control for all U.S. Army and Marine Corps Field Artillery, Mortar, Artillery Meteorological and Radar systems.  The IPADS, enhanced with the Global Positioning System (GPS) (IPADS-G),  addresses deficiencies of the fire support community by providing the ability to maintain the current accuracy of the IPADS without stopping for zero velocity updates; therefore, increasing artillery timeliness, availability of fires, lethality, survivability, and force protection on extended convoys or artillery missions. The IPADS-G can be aided by an internal GPS receiver; however, it must also be capable of operating in an inertial fashion independently of GPS aiding."

The CDU-R is a hardware refresh effort to address obsolescence of electronic components. The requested funding supports the fielding of the CDU-R, including essential fielding costs such as engineering support, shipping to and from the contractor location, publications, software updates, and new equipment training. The CDU-R enhances capability for common survey enabling safe, accurate, and lethal fires. The requested funding will also be used to support the Simplified User Interface (SUI) software update and implementation. This software update is being executed to provide a simplified user interface to the IPADS-G framework so that a non-surveyor can easily and successfully operate the IPADS-G with CDU-R.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

            "val": "Ship gun systems equipment provides funds for the procurement of equipment, material and Ordnance Alterations to improve combat effectiveness and logistic supportability for gun and mission planning systems, and ancillary support equipment.\n\nP40A - 1\/ The Naval Fires Control System is an automated mission planning and coordination system for the Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) System.  It automates shipboard land attack battle management duties to be interoperable and consistent with joint C4ISR systems.  The system significantly improves the Navy's ability to support forces ashore.  These improvements provide enhanced capabilities and reduce total ownership costs by improving reliability and supportability of in-service systems. This system also reduces manning requirements for NSFS missions.\n\n[P40A - 2 \/ NV039 Night Vision Devices]: Procures new Night Vision Devices (NVD) for ships and shore sites.  Provides replacement of NVD and NVD Test Equipment.\n\n[P40A - 2 \/ NV051 Optical Sight Systems Production Improvement]: Procures various Product Improvements for MK46 OSS\/MK20 Electro-Optical Sight System (EOSS) on DDG 51 and CG 47 Class ships.  The OSS is an integral element of the MK 34 Gun Weapon System.  These improvements provide enhanced force protection capabilities, improve availability to address increase in Fleet underway operations, and reduce total ownership costs by improved reliability and supportability of in-service equipment systems.  System and component improvements include: Mod 0 Technical Refresh, upgrade of Daylight Imaging Sensor Field of View, system power supplies, Mod 0 console \/ monitor upgrade, system obsolescence replacement and component level product improvements."

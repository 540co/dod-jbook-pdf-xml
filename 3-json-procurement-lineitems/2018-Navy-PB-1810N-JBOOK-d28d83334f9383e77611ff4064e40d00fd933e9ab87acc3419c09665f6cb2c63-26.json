            "val": "CHEMICAL & BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE PROGRAM (INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS):\nPublic Law 103-160, Section 1703 created a Joint Service Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to address ever growing threats from the aggressive proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Joint CBDP funds the development and procurement of Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) Equipment to enhance the warfighter's ability to survive and complete their mission in a chemical biological contaminated environment. The Navy is responsible for the associated installation\/integration and sustainment funds only. The Navy's requirement for Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS), Improved Point Detection System\/Lifecycle Replacement (IPDS\/LR), Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS), Next Generation Chemical Detection (NGDS) System, and Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) system has been validated by CNO in associated Joint Operational Requirements Documents.\n\nInstallation of Equipment\nFunding is for installation of equipment including Fleet Modernization Program installations, installation of training equipment and installation of equipment in other shore facilities. Procurement of equipment is funded by the Joint\nService CBDP.\n\nDetector installation costs can vary significantly, even within ship class,  depending  on installation location (East coast, West coast, OCONUS, etc.), if installation accomplished pier side or in a ship yard (i.e. availability type during which installation actually occurs), ship as built and as found conditions,  and installation growth work (i.e. unplanned\/unexpected work) driven by as found conditions.\n\n[P3A \/ CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM IPDS\/LR]: - FY16 installations include four (4) MCM Class ship at $193.4K each, one (1) LSD 41 Class ship at $203.4K, three (3)CG-47 Class ships at $205K each, two (2) DDG-51 Class ships at $189.4K each, and one (1) LCC-19 Class ship at $205.9K. Total installation costs for IPDS-LR in FY16 is $2,177K for eleven (11) ships. FY16 DSA cost is $672K.\n\n\n- FY17 installations include three (3) MCM Class ship at $180.3K each, three (3) LHD-1 Class ship at $196.5K each, one (1) LPD-17 Class ship at $158.4K, two (2) LSD-49 Class ships at $185.4K each, one (1) CG-47 Class ships at $205K each, one (1) DDG-51 Class ship at $190K, and one (1) CVN-68 Class ship at $182K. Total installation costs for IPDS-LR in FY17 is $2,237K for twelve (12) ships.  FY17 DSA cost is $552K.\n\n - FY18 installations include two (2) LCS Class ships at $219.4K each, two (2) LSD-41 Class ships at $206.5K each, three (3) CG-47 Class ships at $215.8K each, and four (4) DDG-51 Class ships at $187.7K each. Total installation cost for IPDS-LR in FY18 is $2,250K for eleven (11) ships.  FY18 DSA cost is $406K.\n\n\n- FY19 installations include three (3) LSD-49 Class ships at $200.5K each and two (2) CG-47 Class ships at $194.9K each.  FY19 DSA cost is $312.7K.\n\n- FY20 installations include two (2) CG-47 Class ships at $203.4K and one (1) LSD-49 Class ship at $198.2K.\n\n[P3A \/ IPDS\/LR]: The IPDS\/LR (formerly SEACADS\/IPDS) will improve the existing shipboard point detection system for detecting and identifying chemical nerve and blister agent contamination presence. Inventory objective for shipboard installations is 123.\n\n[P3A - 2 \/ CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM JBAIDS]: JBAIDS plan - \n- FY16 installations include one (1) LHA-6 Class ship at $89.1K and one (1)CVN-68 Class ship at $89.1K. Total installation costs for JBAIDS in FY16 is $178.2K for two (2) ships.\n\n[P3A - 2 \/ JBAIDS]: The JBAIDS will provide U.S. operating forces with a biological organism identification and diagnostic device that will identify and quantify biological organisms of operational concern and other pathogens of clinical significance for confirmatory and prognostic purposes. Inventory objective for shipboard JBAIDS installations is 23 and Refrigeration installations is 17.\n\n[P3A - 3 \/ CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM JBAIDS REFRIGERATION UPGRADE]: JBAIDS Hardware Upgrade plan - \n- FY17 installation includes one (1) CVN-68 Class ship at $84.3K.\n\n[P3A - 6 \/ NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)]: The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is a technology replacement for the IPDS and IPDS-LR systems. The program consists of four variants for multiple applications; the Navy will be installating variant 1 for fixed chemical agent detection capability. The inventory objective for shipboard installations is 185.\n\n[P3A - 7 \/ ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)]: The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) system is a lifecycle replacement kit for existing JBPDS installations. Intended as a retrofit kit which will be installed using the Joint Service CBDP budget, there are seven (7) ships that will not receive the JBPDS system prior to EMBD entering the fleet, and will thus require full EMBD kits (EMBD retrofit kit + shell) with installation funded through this budget. LCS-2 and LCS-4 had JBPDS partially installed during new ship construction by the shipyard and will require installation of the EMBD retrofit kit and re-installation of the system properly to make the systems functional.  The inventory objective for shipboard installations is 9."

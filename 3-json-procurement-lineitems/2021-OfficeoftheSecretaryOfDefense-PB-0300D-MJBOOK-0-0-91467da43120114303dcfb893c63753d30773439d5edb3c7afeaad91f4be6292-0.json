            "val": "In FY 2020 the Office of the Secretary of Defense request for $43.7 Million supports funding initiatives such as the Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, Enterprise Portals Program, Joint Capability Technology Demonstration, Long Range Planning, and the U.S. Mission to NATO.  The funding requested is for the modernization of office automation and Information Technology (IT) infrastructure requirements, procurement of mission essential new and replacement equipment for these components and for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Systems to address National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) and a Defense-wide Countering Nuclear Threats (CNT) Materiel development Program.  The funding also supports the DoD's Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts through the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (AWCFT). \n\nAs a result of Defense Wide Review, Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program (MPP) program funding was zeroed. However, the MPP business model will shift from a cost reimbursable program to an allowable cost program to attract and expand participation in the MPP.  The Department is committed to working with industry to define the new program requirements, cost structure, and agreements to strengthen the DoD supply chain to address warfighter needs. The total reduction across the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) reads as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\nResources ($ in Million) \t\t\t\t                      \n\nFY 2021    -$29.7\nFY 2022    -$30.1    \nFY 2023    -$30.5   \nFY 2024    -$30.8    \nFY 2025    -$31.2          \nFYDP        -$152.4\n                 \n\nThe FY 2021 request facilitates the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the National Defense Business Operations Plan (NDBOP) by supporting:\n\nStrategic Goal 1:  Build a More Lethal Joint Force, and\n\nStrategic Objective 1.2 - Lay the foundation for future readiness through recapitalization, innovation, and modernization\nStrategic Objective 1.3 - Enhance information technology and cybersecurity capabilities\nStrategic Objective 1.4 - Ensure the best intelligence, counterintelligence, and security support to DoD operations"

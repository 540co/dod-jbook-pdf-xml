BEC 0 is an Army Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24\/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected threat actors across the full range of military operations.  DoD ABIS enables actionable intelligence supporting offensive operations and preventing espionage, sabotage, terrorist operations and other coercive actions against US forces and partner nations.  DoD ABIS enables the Army, all other DOD components, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions.  DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation, and improve business practices."

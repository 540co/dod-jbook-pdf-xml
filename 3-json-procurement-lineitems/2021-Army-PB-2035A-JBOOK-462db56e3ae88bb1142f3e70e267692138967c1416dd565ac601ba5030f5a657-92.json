            "val": "This program supports the procurement and upgrade of the Automated Integrated Survey Instrument (AISI) and Global Positioning System - Survey (GPS-S). This equipment supports the survey mission of both the Topographic and Construction Engineer. Capabilities provided by this equipment enable engineers to establish the geodetic control necessary for construction and topographic surveys with centimeter level precision in electronic contested environments. GPS-S integrates Selective Availability, Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), and Precise Positioning System GPS software upgrades into a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) GPS for military survey applications. Additionally, this equipment supports Construction Engineering surveys (e.g., roads, buildings, logistics sites, staging areas, and airfield construction). Software functionality, included as part of this procurement, allows the user to accomplish the design work necessary for site design and construction (e.g., materiel calculations, labor, resources). GPS-S interfaces with current Army Survey equipment to perform integrated GPS\/optical surveys. Additionally, this leverages the Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (ENFIRE) tablet PC to post process survey data files and import survey design files. GPS-S meets FAA standards for airfield survey and allows for standardized commercial data exchanges such that it is interoperable with commercial software and hardware equivalents. GPS-S kits are comprised of Commercial Off the Shelf equipment. GPS-S Hardware and Software are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) procurements.\n\nThe GPS-Survey Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 520."

GPS-S kits are comprised of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) equipment. Funds were also used to field and provide new equipment training to units CONUS and OCONUS.\n\nFY 2020 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.000 million support the procurement of up to 30 Global Positioning System - Survey (GPS-S) kits for Active Duty, National Guard, and Army Reserve units. GPS-S kits are comprised of Commercial Off the Shelf equipment.\n\nFY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.995 million will further support the accelerated procurement, fielding and NET of COTS GPS-S that was initiated in FY20. There will be 30 kits acquired and distributed to Active Duty, National Guard, and Army Reserve units. The equipment will leverage the latest surveying technologies and will be used to support CONUS and OCONUS operations.\n\nIn accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110 - 181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

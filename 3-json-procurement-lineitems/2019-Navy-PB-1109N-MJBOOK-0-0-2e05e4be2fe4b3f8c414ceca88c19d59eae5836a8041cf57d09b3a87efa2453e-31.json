            "val": "BASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) provides all Marine Corps installations with the base area network communications infrastructure that connects the end-user to the DISA network.  BTI modernizes, sustains, upgrades and enhances the telecommunications systems infrastructure for all Marine Corps Installations in order to meet the demands required to support the 5th Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  BTI is designed to maintain current industry standards as they relate to technological capabilities for all voice, video and data services and are transported via each installation's infrastructure.  These data services include, support for but are not limited to: Enhanced 911 (E911), Video-Teleconferencing, Integrated Services Digital Network, Marine Corps Enterprise Network, Energy Monitoring Control Systems, Intrusion Detection Systems, Access Control Systems, Fire Alarm Control Networks and Fleet Training Systems.  This includes supporting systems such as optical networks, telecommunications management systems, primary power, voice mail, teleconferencing, and outside plant infrastructure.  The ongoing focus is technology refresh and standardization on DISA Unified Capabilities (UC) (voice, video, collaboration, and data)  through modernization of installation infrastructure in order to maintain connection to the DISA network.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) is a framework of laws, policies, procedures, and technologies for the use of digital credentials, which provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in electronic communications and transactions. PKI allows secure access to IT systems. PKI has the ability to electronically sign documents, encrypt messages and documents, and to authenticate and protect web access... In compliance with DOD policy and direction, the USMC Public Key Infrastructure Program (PKI) program provides the resources, manpower and equipment (hardware and software), dedicated to the management (i.e.: generation, production, distribution, control, accounting and destruction) of keys and certificates used by public key-based security services to include NIPRNet and SIPRNet both garrison and deployed.  The PKI program operates the USMC Certificate Validation Infrastructure necessary to ensure that only authorized users and server based applications are allowed to operate on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN).  These services are required for user access to all information system components on the MCEN including network accounts, applications and web sites.  PKI must be operable in garrison and tactical\/deployed environments.\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS) is a centrally managed program to field a technology solution in support of emergency dispatch personnel that facilitates timely responses when emergency calls for service are received.  CERS provides command and coordination dispatch functions for first responders to support All-Hazard missions.  It standardizes Emergency Dispatch Centers to provide notification functions, resource management and situational awareness in order to increase efficient emergency and day-to-day first responder operations.  CERS capability is achieved through delivery of Enhanced 911 (E911) and emergency dispatch capabilities consisting of Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Fire Station Alerting (FSA) and Mobile Data Computers (MDC) for first responder's vehicles. \n  \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR): E-LMR is a modern, digital, Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 Trunked radio system at all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS).   It provides the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) communications that are required to support the Consolidated Emergency Response System and First Responders (i.e. Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services) as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiative.  Specifically, the radio system provides RF coverage to BPS populated areas and roads in-between, permitting positive command and coordination between Dispatchers and First Responders and enables their ability to respond to incidents during normal, crisis, and recovery operations.  In the wake of 9\/11 and the Ft. Hood incident, DoD recognized that effective emergency communications and mutual aid support operation are key elements in providing homeland security, reducing the loss of life and the preservation of property.  Thus, the objective for the E-LMR acquisition is to bring forth a reliable interoperability wireless communication system with a limited data capability.  \n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEER ENVIRONMENT: Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides the only Marine Corps organic, operationally relevant, MAGTF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) architecture for testing and engineering tasks. This environment is the sole organic solution in the Marine Corps for Link-16 Tactical Data Link Networks for air-to- air, ship, and shore targeting and messaging, validated at MCTSSA before Marine\/Navy use in theater. The environment also provides Marine Corps organic equipment, environments, operators, and testers for Joint Communications Exercises, Joint Interoperability Testing, and Systems of System testing. Funding supports modernization and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers. The environment is essential to operating forces support for fielded C4I systems, as well as evaluating USMC and Joint C4I systems in a controlled, repeatable, and re-configurable manner that reduces program risk and identifies significant deficiencies prior to fielding to the operating forces. More than forty Marine Corps C4I programs and systems rely on MCTSSA support.\n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum information operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and a comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO into Marine Corps operations.  Multiple classification levels require separate Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support each classification level in accordance with National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency standards.  This includes equipment necessary for connecting internal MCIOC IT infrastructure (voice, video, and data) with the existing Marine Corps Base Quantico support infrastructure."

            "val": "Beginning in FY19, MCIOP and TEEE funding has been realigned from BLI 4635 COMM & ELEC INFRASTRUCTURE SUPT, to BLI 4620, ITEMS UNDER $5 MILLION (COMM & ELEC).\n\nFY2018 Justifications: $44.455M\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $32.893M:\n\n$10.110M will support DPRI. FY18 funding is required to install base telecommunications infrastructure for two Japanese funded MILCON projects in Guam. These projects will establish a non-live fire training area in Andersen South and a waterfront headquarters facility in Apra Harbor. The Andersen South training facility will provide Marines with the ability to maintain readiness by conducting convoys, military operations on urbanized terrain, and breaching. The waterfront headquarters facility is required for the mobilization and de-mobilization of cargo and personnel in\/out of Guam.  These requirements are directly related to the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  \n\n$22.783M will support the technology refresh and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at two Marine Corps installations. The funding increase of $13.582M from FY17 to FY18 is due to the increase in the number of installations receiving the UC\/DWDM upgrade and the alignment of the DPRI BTI installation schedule with the Guam construction schedule.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI):\n$1.409M funding will support the continuation of PKI hardware and software implementation across the (NIPRNet and SIPRNet) for both garrison and deployed networks in order to meet CYBERCOM's Tasking Order requiring the use of hardware tokens for access to networks, network resources and secure email in accordance with DODI 8520.02 and DODI 8520.03.

Realignment of effort to new BLI 4620 in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP):\n$0.251M Funding is for the refresh of hardware required on both the classified Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and unclassified Open Source Information System (OSIS) networks.  JWICS and OSIS are both provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) through Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). JWICS provides MCIOC with classified network connectivity and OSIS provides MCIOC with unclassified network connectivity.  \n\n\nThe FY 2019 funding request was reduced by ($.648) million to reflect the Department of Navy's effort to support the Office of Management and Budget directed reforms for Efficiency and Effectiveness that include a lean, accountable, more efficient government.\n\nFY2019 Justifications: $83.971M\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $54.349M:\nGrowth from FY18 to FY19 is due to the BTI Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) install schedule and UC\/DWDM schedule.  The funding increase of $21.456M from FY18 to FY19 is due to greater size, scope and complexity of completing the modernizations at the installations receiving the UC\/DWDM upgrade in FY19 and the alignment of the DPRI BTI installation schedule with the Guam construction schedule.  \n\nDPRI BTI ($30.630M): FY19 Funding, executed by Space and Naval Warfare Center (SPAWAR), will procure, install and accredit, Information Technology (IT) systems.  The scope of the work will support the ongoing eight MILCON projects. Of which, there are two Japanese funded MILCON projects ( J-007 Waterfront HQ and J-755 Urban Combat Trng) and six U.S. funded MILCON projects (P-250 MALS Fac, P-260 Corrosion Ctrl Hangar, P-270 ACE Gym & Dining, P-295 Ordnance Ops, P-601 Aircraft Maintenance #2, and P-715 KD Ranges). The IT systems are integral to making the facilities complete and useable. All projects are vital to supporting the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  \n\nUC\/DWDM Upgrades($23.719M): FY 19 Funding will support the upgrade and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at one large Marine Corps installation. Modernization and upgrade of the network telecommunications infrastructure is necessary to ensure the delivery of voice, video, and data services that support the day-to-day operations of the Base, Post, and Station.  These services impact unit coordination (deploying personnel\/organizations), Base operations (air operations, live fire ranges, First Responders, Force Protection, etc.), and critical life safety (i.e. E911, Fire Alarm Control, Intrusion Detection, and Access Control Systems).\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI):\n$.119M funding will support the continuation of PKI hardware and software implementation across the (NIPRNet and SIPRNet) for both garrison and deployed networks in order to meet CYBERCOM's Tasking Order requirement. Funding decrease of $1.290M from FY18 to FY19 is the result of virtualization of tactical hardware and the reclassification of NIPRNet Enterprise Alternate Tokens and SIPRNet Tokens from equipment to consummables.\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS):\n$8.391M will support technical refresh engineering and system hardware\/software upgrade. The increase of $3.682M from FY2018 to FY2019 is the result of funding provided for the mandated system hardware\/software upgrade. \n \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR):\n$13.485M funding will support multi-band radio (MBR) technical refresh and associated fielding support as well as system hardware\/software upgrade.  The increase of $9.213M from FY2018 to FY2019 if the result of the start of Multi Band Radio refresh and the mandated system hardware\/software upgrade.\n\nE-LMR DPRI ($7.627M) - Funding is required to procure equipment to expand the current ELMR network that supports Joint Region Marianas (JRM). JRM provides ELMR support for all DOD and Federal organizations on the island of Guam.  The Marine Corps is increasing the active duty population on Guam by ~5,000 personnel. The increase of personnel drives additional requirements for fire and emergency services, which in turn increase radio communication requirements. The Marine Corps is only expanding the current system to accommodate additional subscriber bandwidth.  ELMR expansion is vital to supporting the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.\n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT - EQUIPMENT & TECHNICAL SERVICES (TEEE):\nRealignment of effort to new BLI 4620 in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP):\nRealignment of effort to new BLI 4620 in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR."

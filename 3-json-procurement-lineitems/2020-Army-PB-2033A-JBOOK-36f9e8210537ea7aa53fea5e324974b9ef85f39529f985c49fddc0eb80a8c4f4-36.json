This includes but is not limited to mounting systems, tripods, bipods, rails, barrels, stocks, optics, coatings and lubrications. In addition, engineering studies will investigate modification and production issues of all small arms weapons."

            "val": "FY 2020 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.327 million supports the Active Army by procuring 1,190 M192 MWO Kits to modify fielded systems and 75 M205 Tripod MWO Kits.  The M192 MWO Kit delivers a system improvement to this lightweight tripod. Fielded in 2005, the M192 is no longer compatible with the various body armor designs fielded in recent years.  The M192 MWO Kit addresses identified shortcomings in the design and provides increased height of the pintle as well as improved performance of the traversing and elevation mechanism.  The M205 Tripod MWO Kit improves performance of this lightweight tripod for the dismounted M2\/M2A1\/MK19 Machines Guns.  Funding also supports the M197 MWO Kit that upgrades the existing M197 Vehicle Mounts to add a link\/spent case deflector and ammo handling system.  These upgrades provide capability improvements addressing issues that Soldiers have identified as shortcomings of the current system. During the year of execution additional unplanned work efforts may be required to support small arms modifications as listed in the description. \n\nThe M205 Tripod MWO Kit is a New Start in FY 2020.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

User activity monitoring is the technical capability to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device access US Government information in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. The OPA program supports three objectives. First, it provides advanced analytics (including user behavior modeling software) to increase UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. Second, it provides additional system hardware, and third, it support the procurement of the next generation Army UAM tool in FY 2021. Advanced analytics procurement includes commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and open source software. This capability will increase UAM analysts' effectiveness and efficiency. The primary objective is to employ COTS technology to identify potential insider threats by monitoring behavior between users, user interactions with data and network capabilities (especially in regards to privileged users), and monitoring user compliance with network and data standards and policies."

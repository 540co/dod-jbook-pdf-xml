            "val": "The equipment procured under the Other Ships Training Equipment line supports Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) and Combat Systems training requirements. Funding for Surface Ship Training Devices were consolidated under LI 5664 starting in FY17.\n\n[P40A \/ (H5265) SURFACE SUSTAINING TTE]: Funds procure Hull Mechanical & Electrical (HM&E) and Combat System technical training equipment (TTE) identified by the Naval Education & Training Command (NETC) for the training activities.  Provides equipment to augment existing TTE due to increased student throughput; replaces equipment beyond economical repair and procures new equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ (H5374) LCS SEAFRAME SIMULATORS]: Funds procure LCS Simulators for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS), in Newport, RI. Simulators are needed to meet the Train to Qualify Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers and installing this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities in each homeport and at SWOS. Trainers are required for both of the ship variants, with initial procurements for the San Diego homeport and SWOS, followed by procurements for the Mayport and Norfolk homeports within the FYDP. Throughput of LCS crews requires multiple  simulators in a homeport.\n\nLCS Part Task Trainers - Devices that permit selected aspects of a task (Bridge, Combat Systems, Mission Bay Components) to be practiced independently of other elements of the task, and independently of the Intergrated Tactical Trainers (ITTs) to most efficiently address Train to Qualify (T2Q) and Train to Certify (T2C) objectives while managing student throughput.\n\nLCS Virtual Ship Training System - Comprehensive network infrastructure and computing environment, including Virtual Reality Labs (VRLs), within the LCS Training Facilities to support delivery and management of all components of LCS Training.\n\nLCS Mission Bay Trainers - Enable the qualification, training, and team certification of the individuals and teams working in the Mission Bay, to include preparation and launching\/recovering of mission module off-hull remote vehicles, and operating of the cranes, doors, and other associated equipment in the Mission Bay. The Mission Bay Trainer includes full-scale replicas of the Mission Bay. FY16 funding supports outfitting the LCS Training Facility in Mayport, FL.  (The first ship assigned to Mayport , LCS 9, arrives in FY16.)\n\nLCS Integrated Tactical Trainers - These are full scale simulations of Tactical Software that enable integrated team training of Bridge, Combat Systems, Engineering, and Mission Package systems\/watchstations. Follow-on Integrated Team Trainer procurement (FY16 and follow) will include crew served weapon simulators (discussed below). FY16 funds the procurement of one FREEDOM variant Integrated Team Trainer for Mayport and a second INDEPENDENCE variant Integrated Team Teainer for San Diego (for a total of two (2) Integrated Team Trainers procured in FY16).\n\nSurface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) Bridge Trainer - This trainer supports Officer pipeline training at SWOS, Newport in support of Division Officer, Department Head, and PXO\/PCO pipeline training for Officer of the Deck Training. This trainer permits selected aspects of Bridge tasks (including Engineering Control tasks) to be practiced independently of Combat Systems Operations to support individual or individual bridge team training, vice the integrated training in the more complex Integrated Team Trainer. This training facilitates more efficient accomplishment of Train to Certify and Train to Qualify objectives. \n\nCrew Served Weapons Simulators - Funds procure tactical training crew served weapons stations. Stand-alone units will be procured for follow-on integration with the Integrated Team Trainers in San Diego and Mayport.\n\n[P40A \/ (H5276) SUBSURFACE SUSTAINING TTE]: Funds procure Subsurface HM&E Fleet and Team Trainer Technical Training Equipment (TTE), Training Enhancement Changes (TECs), support equipment, and various upgrades to simulators \/ stimulators, such as the Submarine Bridge Trainer (SBT), Submarine Ship Control Operator Trainer (SCOT), and Next Generation Firefighter Trainer (FFT) identified by the Submarine Learning Center (SLC) and approved by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), for use at the submarine training activities.  This TTE\/Training Unique Equipment (TUE), sustains a better quality of training and replaces equipment beyond economical repair or procures new equipment.  Funds also procure Submarine High Risk Trainer procurement for Pressurized Submarine Escape Trainers and Damage Control Wet Trainers.\n\nFleet Interactive Display Equipment (FIDE) trainers are provided for nuclear power plant training. FIDEs support multiple ship classes and FIDE configurations at 9 different geographic sites, each requiring different levels of installation work; thus the cost for the program varies widely from year to year depending on the combination of these factors.\nVirginia (VA) Class trainers are procured for the 2nd and 3rd home ports and for configuration updates to existing trainers."

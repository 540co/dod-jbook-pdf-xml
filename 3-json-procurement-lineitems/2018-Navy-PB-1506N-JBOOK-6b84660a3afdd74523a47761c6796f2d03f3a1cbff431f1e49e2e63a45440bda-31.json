            "val": "The FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $123.314M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.\n\nThe F-35B Program will develop and deploy a family of highly common, affordable, next generation, stealthy, multi-role strike fighters that meet the needs of multiple services and countries.  The United States Marine Corps Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) correction of deficiencies effort provides near and long term improvements to the fleet, focusing on documented deficiencies related to safety, maintainability, and aircraft systems.  These modifications and selected component changes are being accomplished by field and depot retrofit.  In order to meet emerging deficiencies the airframe and integrated systems must be modified as critical corrections\/changes are identified.  Funds will be used to manage, prepare, process and incorporate concurrency changes to sustain and improve F-35B system operations.  Concurrency changes are implemented to coincide with resources and aircraft availability.  Block upgrades provide more robust performance in navigation, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, maintainability, and mission deployment of the F-35B platform.  This modification program will bring early production aircraft and integrated systems to a common fleet configuration as fielded capabilities evolve over the course of the F-35 program.  \n\nThe modification funding requested in FY18 enables several distinct efforts pertaining to the Marine F-35B aircraft to include post aircraft delivery concurrency retrofits, to correct deficiencies, the block upgrade of hardware and software to a Block 3i configuration, and the block upgrade of software components to a full Block 3F configuration. \n\nDEVELOPMENT STATUS\/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES\nThe overlap of development with production and operations results in the need to manage a concurrency program and conduct retrofits on jets with life-limited parts or impacts to capabilities. Block 3i Fleet Release occured 4th Qtr FY15. Block 3F Fleet Release is planned by 3rd Qtr FY17."

The retrofits to enable the final Block 3F configuration are comprised of hardware and software.  The hardware per aircraft includes new radar modules, new Integrated Core Processor modules and rack, and new electronic warfare modules.  Aircraft need to be updated to a final Block 3F configuration to avoid cost associated with maintaining multiple configurations of aircraft at operating locations.  Some will require multiple modifications to reach the final Block 3F configuration.\n\nThis effort (OSIP 015-14) focuses on upgrading Blocks 1B, 2A, and 2B aircraft from LRIPs 2-5 to a Block 3i configuration.  Block 3i is a stepping stone to the Block 3F configuration.  It includes the procurement of Tech Refresh 2 (TR2) hardware for the Block 3i configuration.  The parts include new radar modules, new Integrated Core Processor (ICP) modules and rack, and new Electronic Warfare (EW) modules.  The Gen III Helmet will also be introduced as part of the Block 3i upgrade.  This effort includes tooling and test equipment for Military Service Depots to support the execution of the Block Upgrade program.\n\nDEVELOPMENT STATUS\/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES\nBlock 3i Software Fleet Release occured 4th Qtr FY15."

The retrofits to enable the final Block 3F configuration are comprised of hardware and software.  Aircraft need to be updated to a final Block 3F configuration to avoid cost associated with maintaining multiple configurations of aircraft at operating locations.  Some will require multiple modifications to reach the final Block 3F configuration.\n\nThis effort (OSIP 005-16) focuses on the Block 3F configuration upgrade effort for 36 LRIP 2-5 and 18 LRIP 6-8 F-35B aircraft and integrated systems.  All of the LRIP 2-5 F-35B aircraft receiving the Block 3F software under this OSIP will have already received the Block 3i hardware under OSIP 015-14. This effort purchases all necessary software and installation labor to ensure LRIP 2-8 F-35B aircraft are upgraded to a Block 3F baseline for full warfighting capability.\n\nDEVELOPMENT STATUS\/MAJOR DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES\nBlock 3F Fleet Release planned 3rd Qtr FY17."

                        "val": "This effort (OSIP 023-14) funds retrofits due to concurrency changes to correct deficiencies discovered after DD-250 of the last aircraft in a given production lot. This includes modifications required to extend aircraft service life currently limited by low-life parts, and relieve capability limitations driven by concurrency of production with development.  \n\nThe concurrency funding line will procure the highest priority modifications from the Tri-Service Modification Prioritization List, as they become supportable from an engineering, production, and installation standpoint.  The list is vetted by the Services and Partners every 6 months to ensure the list accurately reflects existing requirements as well as emerging issues.  Per-kit costs will vary for each modification being implemented, and in some cases will also vary for aircraft from different LRIP lots to implement an individual modification.  \n\nTotal cost reflects procurement and installation costs in each fiscal year.  Support costs include overall modification program planning, scheduling, and management; and support of Military and Service Depots and Depot Field Teams for incorporation of modifications.  \n\nThe following modifications will be the highest priorities for accomplishment throughout the STOVL fleet using funds from this OSIP.  \n\nTI Number          CR Title   \nTI-0000-0015 Stress Failure of Hydraulic Tube Support Bracket\nTI-0000-0031 Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) Motor Qualification Failure\nTI-0000-0045 CTOL\/STOVL MLG SDD & LRIP Part Number Rolls\nTI-0000-0049 Ordnance Quick Latch System (OQLS) FS 424 Latch Corrosion Control\nTI-0000-0055 IPP Bay Vent Fan Electrical Bond\nTI-0000-0056 IPP Controller Part Number Roll\nTI-0000-0058 Back-Up Radio Tray Clearance\nTI-0000-0063 Bootstrap Accumulator Redesign\nTI-0000-0064 Counter Measures Door Control Valve Life Limitation on AF:6\nTI-0000-0098 CTOL Nose Landing Gear\nTI-0000-0117 CTOL Trestle Inst Cotter Pin Alignment and Joint Clamp up (PR-45840)\nTI-0000-0119 Production Ejection Seat (LRIP I & II) MWARS Replacement with Negative G Strap & New Cartridge Set Part Numbers\nTI-0000-0122 28V BATTERY AND CHARGER CHANGES\nTI-0000-0124 Controller, Motor Pump Qual Failure\nTI-0000-0129 MLG Control Valve Part Number Roll\nTI-0000-0130 Emergency Control Valve Qual Failure\nTI-0000-0132 Valve, Mechanical Sequence - T Qual Failure\nTI-0000-0133 Filter Module, Pressure Qual Failure\nTI-0000-0135 Engine Driven Pump Life Limit\nTI-0000-0137 Pump, Motor GND Maint Qual Failure\nTI-0000-0138 Wingtip Light Improvement For FAA Compliance\nTI-0000-0145 2AF:0006-0007 and AF:0017-0020.

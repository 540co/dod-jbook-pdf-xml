            "val": "The Family of Environmental Control Equipment consists of Environmental Control Units (ECU), Field Refrigeration Systems, Integrated Trailer ECU and Generator Systems, and Cooling and Refrigeration Expeditionary Tool Kits. These systems provide required heating, cooling, storage, and servicing for systems throughout the Marine Corps. Current efforts seek to replace all legacy ECUs with systems of higher reliability and higher efficiency using EPA-approved refrigerants, more energy efficient enhanced mobility, easier to repair, and quieter than their predecessors. With environmental control systems consuming 50-70% of tactical electric power in theater, this savings will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum-derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road). The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.\n\nEfforts include procurement of the following principal end items and ancillary equipment:\n(1) Field Refrigeration Systems (FRS) Refrigerant Unit (RU) replacement. This effort seeks to replace legacy RUs in current USMC Large and Small FRSs complying with EPA regulations while increasing efficiency thus reducing overall power requirements\/demands.\n\n(2) The Enhanced Environmental Control Unit (E2CU) program is the second generation of a family of environmental control units from 9,000 BTU to 60,000 BTU\/Hr cooling output. The E2CU program will provide tactical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and superior reliability for all MAGTF units in all operational concepts. E2CU will have significant average fuel efficiency improvements over the current ECU family has been demonstrated while complying with newer EPA regulations on refrigerants."

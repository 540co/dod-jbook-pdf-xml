            "val": "This budget line item funds procurement of various items of equipment to support the operating forces at Naval Stations and related facilities, including, but not limited to the following:\n\nMobile Aircraft Fire Training Devices:  Procurement of a trailer mounted fully-contained device that allows firefighters to conduct live fire fighting techniques to meet Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) requirements. The device has interior and exterior fire scenario props to fully prepare the firefighters for aircraft firefighting and rescue missions. Combination Interior and Structure Training Device:  Procurement of combination confined space, SCBA, Shipboard Sub, and structural fire fighter mobile trainer focused on interior aircraft and structure fire training evolutions to meet NAVAIR, DoN, and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.  The unit is used for live fire training and practical rescue exercises.\n\nMobile Aircraft Training Devices are necessary for the Navy's firefighters to meet minimum firefighting requirements and qualifications. Baseline budget replaces dilapidated equipment and procures new systems to ensure that the Navy's firefighters are able to keep up to date on technology and techniques of interior and\/or exterior firefighting.  Strategic placement of these devices will also minimize travel training costs and maximize our members training opportunities.\n\nCranes and\/or Boat Hoists:  Procurement of cranes\/hoist of various types and sizes (Davit\/Bridge\/Portal\/Gantry\/Mobile Harbor).  All are weight handling systems designed\/selected to meet the specific requirements of the intended facility. \n\nFender\/Bumper\/Separator Systems:  Procurement includes various size and shaped energy absorbing cushions placed between a pier and a ship\/submarine or between two ships\/submarines. Multiple fenders may be used with different size and types of ships.  Various types of filling of air or other material may be procured.  Standard type is hydro-pneumatic rubber fender made IAW ISO 17357.  May be used for both submarine and surface ships.\n\nComposite CVN Camels:  Procurement of large floating metal or composite structures designed to maintain the proper distance for CV\/CVNs to keep the ships from being damaged or damaging the pier structure.  When USN Carriers are placed alongside a pier the hull design dictates the need to use standoff equipment.  The camels requested provide the necessary standoff. These composite camels offer considerable reduction in maintenance due to constructed material.  As currently utilized ship support equipment ages it becomes necessary to replace that equipment.  Equipment procurement budgets are not adequate to keep up with the demand for ship support equipment.  As more ships are placed into service the requirement exceeds currently available support equipment.  \n\nSubmarine Deep Draft Camels:  Procurement of very large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance for submarines to keep them from being damaged by the pier.  These may be for specific submarine classes (e.g. Fast Attack), or universal (i.e. for all submarine classes).\n\nUniversal Submarine Composite Camels:  Procurement of universal pierside, composite camels used to breast submarines from piers\/wharves.  They are fabricated of universal composite material with a modular design.  Size is approximately 36 ft W x 18 ft H x 17.6 ft D.  Made per a standard NAVFAC drawing.  Suitable for all classes of submarines.\n\nUtility and Maintenance\/Paint Floats and Barges: Procurement of floating assets that are used by Port Operations and Ship's Force personnel to facilitate external ship work (blasting, painting, other maintenance).  They can also be used as separators or camels.  These can be towed into place, or may even be self-propelled.  They may have permanent or movable work platforms installed as needed to assist in reaching work sites.  Some may have self-ballasting mechanisms to help maintain stability.  They come in various sizes.\n\nComposite Sub camels - as constructed the composite Submarine camels significantly reduce the amount of maintenance required to keep the units serviceable.  Older models, reaching the end of serviceability are made of steel and in some cases wood.  To overhaul these units requires considerable manpower. The older units do not provide the same level of hull protection the composite units provide.  Equipment procurement budgets are not adequate to keep up with the demand for ship support equipment.  As more ships are placed into service the requirement exceeds currently available support equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ DDG Separators]: Large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance for DDG's when nested outboard of another DDG. Also, provides protection from ship-to-ship damage due to vessel maneuvers or where vessel-to-pier contact may occur.\n\n[P40A \/ Composite Submarine Camels]: CNIC'S phased replacement program for submarine camels has taken significant negative budget marks during the past fiscal years.  These reductions have negatively affected CNIC ability to sustain a viable phased replacement program along with reducing funding new purchases.  Continued budget reduction will erode CNIC's ability to protect the Navy's platforms (submarines and surface ships) at the waterfront.\n\n[P40A \/ ESS & IDS NA-283]: Intrusion Detection System (IDS): IDS equipment includes the interior and exterior sensor, surveillance devices and associated communications subsystems that collectively detect intrusion at a specified site, facility, or perimeter.\n\n[P40A \/ THALES MK-20A Instrument Landing Systems]: Procurement of NAVAIR supported Instrument Landing Systems to provide landing capability in adverse weather conditions\n\n[P40A \/ CVN Camels]: 6E70 - CVN Camels:  Procurement of very large floating composite structures, designed to maintain the proper standoff distance for CVNs to keep the ships from being damaged or damaging the pier structure.  This budget request supports the Navy's CVN 21 Future Carrier ship coming online.  Currently, there are no viable assets (CVN Camels) to support homeporting for the Navy' new CVN. The cost increase is associated with using composite material vice steel. These CVN camels are designed to last 25 years. The current inventory of steel CVN camel are past their service life and require an overhaul, without which they may only keep afloat for a couple of years."

The equipment consists of ship and submarine separators\nas well as different types of maintenance barges that are at the end of their service life. Investment in this area had been deferred due to sequestration and other fiscal constraints and equipment recapitalization is necessary.\n\nAdditional Equipment includes:\n\n5 DDG Separators at Navy Regions SW, Hawaii, Japan, and Guam, required to maintain the proper distance of DDGs when nested outboard of another DDG\n2 CVN Camels at Midlant and NW respectively, which are very large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance of CV\/CVNs\n3 Deep Draft Sub Separators at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (2) and Midlant (1), designed to maintain proper distance of Fast Attack or Universal Submarines\n2 Paint Maintenance Barges at NW and GUAM\n1 3-Tier Paint Float Barge at SE used to paint the sides of vessels when in port\n1 4.5 meter Hydro Sub Separator at SW which is a hydro-pneumatic rubber fender used for both Subs and Surface Ships\n2 4.5 meter Fender-Bumper-Separator Systems at Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia (EURAFSWA) and Japan, used as energy absorbing cushions placed between the pier and vessels or between vessels of different size and shapes.\n2 Portable Dock\/Docking Systems at CNRJ that are moveable docking systems that can be used to berth small Navy boats e.g. harbor security boats, utility and work boats known as the Pontoon Section\n\nOCO: \nOCO\/OPN for Isa Air Base F18 Live Fire Training Device ($0.700M):\n\nIn the past, ISA Air Base's (AB) Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) personnel were on a six-month rotation and would receive their required NAVAIR live fire training at home station, prior to arrival.  This rotation period has changed to allow F&ES personnel to permanently stay in-place on ISA AB.  Currently, workarounds are used to acquire required NAVAIR live fire training.  ISA AB's Structural and Combination Helicopter\/Car live fire trainers are acting as substitute training aids; with minimal realism and effectiveness.  \n\nTo meet NAVAIR requirements, an on-site, F18 Jet Live Fire Trainer is needed for ISA AB F&ES personnel to: provide training fires and realistic, forcible entry into and rescue from burning aircraft to obtain and maintain the desired standards of proficiency; conduct a minimum of six, semi-annual live fire training evolutions; and obtain the desired realisms by ensuring aircraft mockup is constructed as close to scale and appearance of actual aircraft.   \n\nNew training device will allow CNIC to meet OPNAVINST, NAVAIR, Department of Defense and National Fire Protection Association standards for Fire Service training requirements. The live fire training device will ensure proficiency of aircraft fire rescue personnel.\n\nPatrol Craft SIGINT Capability:\n\nPersistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) in the Maritime Domain and Choke Points are on the USCENTCOM FY18-22 Integrated Priorities List.  Funding is needed to provide a cryptologic capability on all PC units to the USCENTCOM AOR.  There are currently two PC units outfitted with a similar capability (PC-SCOUT).  The original PC-SCOUT project was funded with FY12 OPN and was executed in 2014 with installations onboard the two PCs in November and December 2014. The original PC-SCOUT initiative filled critical gaps in NAVCENT's collection posture and provided unique access to targets of interest.  OCO funding is needed to upgrade existing capability and increase NAVCENT\/C5F's Organic Persistent ISR capability and allow NAVCENT\/C5F to meet its intelligence requirements in the littorals not accessible by current collection platforms and POR systems.\nCOMFIFTHFLT has a mission critical operational need to provide ISR in support of Named Operations and other maritime activities in the USCENTCOM area of responsibility.  Small littoral vessels (PC) with enhanced collection systems are exceptional platforms (at reduced operating and maintenance costs when compared to DDG and CG program of record systems), due to their operational employment, low electromagnetic interference (EMI) profile, coupled with remote capabilities\/resources has resulted in increased awareness of NAVCENT\/C5F intelligence priorities.  Without adequate OCO funding to support PC SIGINT collection system, NAVCENT\/C5F's ability to collect, monitor, and target significant adversarial maritime activity in the littoral area will increase the risk of miscalculation and translate into potential mission failure and loss of life.\n                                                                                                                        Cost Breakdown:\n                                                                        \nSALVAGE ((Manufacturer: National Security Aagency (NSA) MUSKETEER)), RF Distro, antennas, etc.: $820K X 10 = $8.2M                                                                                                                  \n(U)  SALVAGE is a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) collection, geolocation, and survey software defined radio (SDR) suite, that is a fully automated SIGINT collection and survey capability, which interacts with NSA-standard data flow processes.

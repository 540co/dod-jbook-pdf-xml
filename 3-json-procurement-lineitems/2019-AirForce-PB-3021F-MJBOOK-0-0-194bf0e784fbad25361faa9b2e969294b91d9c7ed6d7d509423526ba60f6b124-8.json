IBS provides intelligence producers and information sources the means to analyze and disseminate strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence and threat warning information directly to the warfighter. The IBS operational baseline represents the migration, integration, and consolidation of existing tactical data dissemination into a future common architecture message format.\n\nIntegrated Broadcast Service Procurement was previously funded in PE 0305179F in FY17 and FY18 Other Procurement\/ BA 03: Electronics and Telecommunications Equip\/BSA 2: Intelligence Programs P-1 Line #14; 832070 Intelligence Comm Equipment BP83."

            "val": "PE 1203179F Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) - P40A\nFY19 funding for IBS procurement efforts are focused in the following areas:\n\n1. CIB UPLINK SITE (CUS) TACTICAL INFORMATION PROCESSOR AND ONLINE FUSION FACILITY (TIPOFF): TIPOFF serves as the control system for the CIB Uplink Site and interface to the IBS Network Services (IBS-NS). Each major release of the software incorporates approved requirements as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability requirements, and system security. The new release supports migration to CIB Uplink Sites.\n\n2. COMMON INTERACTIVE BROADCAST PLANNING TOOL (CIB-PT): The CIB-PT provides the COCOM Planners an integrated software\/hardware mechanism to allocate space-based communications resources to theater and national producers, specifically to reliably optimize the timeliness of scarce bandwidth allocation of extremely time-critical messages. Each major release of the software\/hardware incorporates updated producer prioritization, bandwidth allocation, mission monitoring and interfaces to the STRATCOM systems as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security compliance to achieve threshold requirements. \n\n3. COMMON MESSAGE FORMATE PARSER LIBRARY (CMFPL): The CMF repository is required for the automatic exchange of data among processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) systems. This effort procures the infrastructure for dynamic software library updates for multiple operating systems essential to broadcast operation.\n\n4. IBS V&V Environment: Procures simulation and stimulation tools to certify and verify mission equipment for operational use. Included is the MULTI-AREA REMOTE SIMULATOR (MARS) a component of the IBS verification and validation process used to emulate multiple systems messaging under operational conditions and the UNIVERSAL CIB TEST SET (UCTS) a component that emulates the UHF SATCOM environment.\n\n5. TERMINAL, DATALINK, & ENTERPRISE SERVER MITIGATION: Funds direct mission support activities such as verification & validation documentation; uplink receive and transmit terminal upgrade, enhancements and spares; mitigation; CMF product support; JOINT TACTICAL DATA LINK, i.e., Link 16 support; product documentation; studies and analyses; IBS Web Support and contractor system engineering activities.\n\n6. IBS-NS: Scaling capability is required for messaging under operational use. Funds approved modernization of Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and Theater Interface Nodes (TINS), technology refreshment and integration as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security."

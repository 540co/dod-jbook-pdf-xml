            "val": "ASSAULT BREACHER VEHICLE (ABV) is a tracked, armored combat engineer vehicle designed to breach minefields and complex obstacles and provide a deliberate and in-stride breaching capability. ABV consists of a rebuilt and upgraded M1A1 Tank chassis with the integration of Non-Developmental Items (NDI), which includes a Full-Width Mine Plow, a Dozer Blade, a Surface Mine Plow, a Rapid Ordnance Removal System, two M58 Linear Demolition Charges, a lane marking system and a self-defense weapon system. The ABV will provide crew protection and vehicle survivability while having the speed and mobility to keep pace with the maneuver force. The M1A1 Tank Chassis will provide economic supportability of the system through its commonality with the tank fleet and armor protection for survivability.\n\nMK 154 MODERNIZATION is a line charge launcher system installed in the Amphibious Assault Vehicle Personnel variant (AAVP7) used to breach mine fields in shallow water and inland areas, providing the USMC with an amphibious operations breaching capability.\n\nFAMILY OF EOD EQUIPMENT (FEOD) is comprised of over forty Table of Authorized Material Control Numbers (TAMCNs)  providing the required tools and capabilities to detect, locate, access, identify, triage, diagnose, stabilize, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit, and dispose of unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO), improvised explosive devices (IED), and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  The portfolio includes specialized diagnostic equipment, robotics and energetically actuated tools, which enable EOD to provide the Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) and Marine Special Operations Forces with critical enabling capabilities that deliver responsive, scalable, strategic depth for special operations, crisis response, and littoral access.\n\nMINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV) provides Warfighters multi-mission platforms capable of mitigating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats, which are currently the greatest casualty producers in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Multiple MRAP vehicle categories (CATs) have been procured, fielded, and sustained: MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) - Combat operations (ops) in rural, mountainous, urban terrain.  Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance. Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle. Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal. Funding includes required Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)\/subsystems and Engineering Change Proposal (ECP)\/Capability Insertion in response to an UUNS and Warfighter safety and survivability requirements.\n\nMRAP funding has been realigned to BLI 5050 beginning in FY19.\n\nMARINE ELECTRONIC WARFARE GROUND FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (MEGFoS) provides interconnected electronic warfare systems for use at fixed sites, on tactical vehicles, and dismounted that will operate across a range of frequencies in order to provide the Marine Corps that ability to maneuver efficiently inside the electromagnetic spectrum.  MEGFOS provides the ability to protect friendly use of spectrum, sense all spectrum usage in an area of responsibility, and to target adversaries inside spectrum with the intent to deny, delay or degrade an adversary's decision making cycle.  MEGFOS also includes the ability to use spectrum for force protection to counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) and Unmanned Aerial Systems.  MEGFOS is the follow on capability to MFEW and will begin developmental efforts in FY20 with production efforts beginning FY23. \n\nFAMILY OF COUNTER-IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (C-IED) CAPABILITIES (F2C) provides capabilities not found in the current Joint land force structure to defeat explosive hazards and protect Marines and equipment while conducting route and area clearance operations. The Family of Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) Capabilities (F2C) will enable Commanders to deliberately operate in explosive hazards environments by detecting and marking explosive hazards, enabling the Commanders to make timely and informed decisions to avoid the explosive hazards, or, if necessary, neutralize explosive hazards that impede their missions. Multiple detection and marking capabilities will detect a broader spectrum of explosive hazards and achieve higher overall effectiveness rates. Standoff and remote-controlled detection and marking capabilities will remove Joint forces from direct contact with explosive hazards and enhance force protection and the vehicles' system survivability. Operational speeds and rates will increase and better support the operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of the current and future force. ENFIRE is a digital surveying kit designed to collect and disseminate engineer-related information while minimizing exposure to enemy observation."

This capability will yield faster, more effective route clearance missions, significantly improve chances of avoiding an explosive hazard strike, and better awareness of the enemy's tactics, techniques, and procedures.

PCCIE program is structured\ninto small projects (from 3 - 125 kilovolt amps (kva)) and large projects (greater than 125 kva) and includes associated ancillary equipment.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

Reduce overall footprint and weight by 50-60%.\n2. Reduce operating and sustainment costs by 30%-50%.\n3. Reduce acquisition costs as it applies to installation since many newer systems consist of more internal pre-wiring.\n4. Lower parts count dramatically improves reliability by reducing the potential points of failure within the system.\n5. Produce greater energy savings and higher operating efficiency in all configurations, typically between 92% and 93.5%; with all types of loads."

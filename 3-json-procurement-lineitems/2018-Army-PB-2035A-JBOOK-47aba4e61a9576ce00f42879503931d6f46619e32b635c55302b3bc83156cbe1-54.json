The GFT program satisfies the Active, the National Guard, and the Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo-specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. GFT comprehensively trains Company and below formations to operate in today\u2019s dynamic combat environment. GFT trains higher multi-echelon units and staffs without troops to meet Combatant Commanders\u2019 requirements."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.406 million allows for the Games for Training (GFT) program to enable sustained readiness by efficiently and effectively building Soldier, leader, and unit competency on technical skills necessary to perform multiple mission types in accordance with current tactics, techniques and procedures in preparation for Force 2025 and beyond. Funding primarily supports the procurement hardware technical refresh of ten systems and perform concurrency of the Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) Flagship software license that provides Army Enterprise use rights. The GFT program will also provide other commercial and Government off-the-shelf game software applications used to train Active, Reserve, and Army National Guard soldiers in a PC based, shared environment. Government Management will provide program management, engineering and technical oversight, contract support and travel for the GFT program. Government Furnished Material provides a Web Portal for the centralized distribution, repository of content and tech support of the VBS3 and gaming software for the Army training community. GFT is a critical program enabling other virtual and constructive training capabilities and the Integrated Training Environment (ITE).\n\nThe Flyaway cost increase from FY16 to FY17 listed on the P-5 is a result of the required refresh for the 15 previously procured Gaming Hardware Suites. The increase in unit cost after FY16 is due to increase of performance technology and the addition of Risk Management Framework (RMF) requirements for information assurance regulations. FY17 unit costs for New Gaming Hardware Suites and Gaming Hardware Refresh cost elements should reflect a Unit Cost of $200.000 thousand; this information is not accurately reflected in the P-5 and P-5a and will be updated in the next available future cycle. FY17 Software, Production Engineering and Program Management costs will be adjusted to accommodate this unit cost increase. FY18 is a concurrency year for GFT flagship software.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the Active and Reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

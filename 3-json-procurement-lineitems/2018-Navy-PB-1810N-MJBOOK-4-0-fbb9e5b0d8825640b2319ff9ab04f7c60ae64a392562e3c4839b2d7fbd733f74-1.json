The maintenance\/utility trucks are used to transport tools\/materials necessary for maintenance personnel performing facility maintenance. Panel and multi-stop trucks are used primarily for the movement of material\/equipment requiring protection in an enclosed van-type body and freight trucks are used to move palletized material from warehouses to users. Funding is also included in this line for specialized operations such as the Joint POW\/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), and other mission specific equipment."

Funds requested are for replacement of general purpose trucks at a core installation that provides key logistics services supporting ship and aircraft movements and command and control services for the warfighter in support of Overseas Contingency Operations. The life expectancy of the cargo trucks being replaced is 6-7 years and the average age is 16 years. Replacing inventory will minimize mission impact by moving towards equipment standardization of parts-stocking, minimize maintenance downtime waiting on parts from the states, and eliminate the need for costly commercial leasing to meet mission requirements.\n\nCargo Trucks, QTY=14, $0.390M\n\nIncluded in this request is FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the European Resource Initiative in the amount of $0.106M. The request supports Naval Expeditionary Combat Command's participation and support of additional bilateral and multilateral exercises and training with allies and partners; in support of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nUtility Trucks, QTY=5, $0.106M"

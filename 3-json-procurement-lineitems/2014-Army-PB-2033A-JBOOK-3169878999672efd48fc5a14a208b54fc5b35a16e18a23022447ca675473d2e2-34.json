            "val": "FY 2014 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.024 million supports the Active Army by providing the funding for standalone shotguns and enhanced capabilities for the designated marksmen found in each infantry fire team.  The funding also supports the AMU.  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis.  Between competitions the AMU is firing constantly to hone their skills and the man\/weapon interface so important at that competitive level.  Weapons of all types are fired and the weapons exceed their stated effective life projection faster.  This requires that the weapons be maintained at an extremely high level of maintenance and the weapons must be coded out and replaced regularly.   \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

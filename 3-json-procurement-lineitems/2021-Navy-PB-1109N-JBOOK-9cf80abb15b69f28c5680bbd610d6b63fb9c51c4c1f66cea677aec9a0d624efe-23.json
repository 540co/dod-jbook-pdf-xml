            "val": "This is a Military Intelligence Program (MIP) budget line item.\n\nDistributed Common Ground\/Surface System Marine Corps (DCGS-MC) is integral to delivering decision advantage at the speed of operational relevance outlined in the 2019 National Defense Strategy.  DCGS-MC provides an analysis and production capability within garrison and deployed Marine Corps organizations. DCGS-MC complies with the Department of Defense (DoD) DCGS Enterprise interoperability and information sharing requirements by migrating select processing, exploitation, analysis, and production capabilities into a single, integrated, net-centric baseline within the Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Enterprise (MCISRE). This baseline will enable MCISRE analysts to deliver tactically focused, operational, and strategic intelligence at the tactical edge throughout all phases of operations and will provide relevant, precise decision support for Joint Task Force (JTF), Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), and subordinate Marine units. The DCGS-MC portfolio currently consists of enterprise services and functional analytic and production tools that provide analysts with the ability to process, disseminate, exploit, analyze, and produce intelligence for discovery via the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB). The functional capabilities are grouped by DCGS-MC GEOINT, DCGS-MC All Source, and DCGS-MC SIGINT.  Future capabilities will be delivered via clearly defined Capability Drops determined by an integrated assessment of user needs, technology readiness, risk mitigation, and affordability.\n\nDCGS-MC Geospatial Intelligence (DCGS-MC GEOINT)\n\nDCGS-MC GEOINT provides geo-referenced data and products that establish the GEOINT foundation for battlespace visualization and a common frame of reference to support the Commander's decision making process.  It enables the ability to rapidly respond to, or predict, threats around the world by providing near real time geospatially referenced data and products that serve as the Authoritative Data Source for the full spectrum of Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), joint, and multinational partner's operations. DCGS-MC GEOINT enables mission accomplishment across the range of military operations and with all mission partners. The DCGS-MC GEOINT provides the tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, analysis, production, storage, and dissemination of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, produce, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the Earth. DCGS-MC GEOINT will incorporate those capabilities formally provided by the Tactical Exploitation Group, Topographic Production Capability, Virtual Imagery Processing - Marine Corps, and Target Materials Production legacy systems.\n\nDCGS-MC All Source\n\nDCGS-MC All Source incorporates those capabilities formally provided by the Intelligence Analysis System (IAS) project. This acquisition program is the Marine Corps' primary intelligence analytical toolset at all levels of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  DCGS-MC All Source enables global collaboration with Marine and joint analytical systems. It provides Marines the capability to conduct all-source fusion, analysis, and production of intelligence by automating multiple intelligence functions and processes. This includes the display of current enemy situation, collection requirements, asset management, message parsing, and database updates. DCGS-MC All Source automatically logs intelligence activities into a journal and provides access to intelligence produced by tactical, theater, and national systems and agencies. It facilitates the dissemination and exchange of intelligence and information with other echelons through tactical local area networks and wide area networks from the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) garrison facility down to the infantry company level. DCGS-MC All Source consists of intelligence servers and workstations with their associated peripherals and software.\n\nDCGS-MC Signals Intelligence (DCGS-MC SIGINT)\n\nThe Technical Control Analysis Center (TCAC) FoS is the DCGS-MC SIGINT capability and consists of the TCAC Remote Analysis Workstation (RAWS), the Transportable Workstation (TWS) and the Cross Domain Solution (CDS), and is the focal point of Radio Battalions (RADBN), Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARFORSOC), and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) operations. TCAC automatically collects, stores, retrieves and plays back digital audio signals.  It fuses and analyzes SIGINT data from tactical, theater, and national collectors and databases for dissemination to tactical commanders. TCAC provides SIGINT analysis applications to deployable MAGTF units capable of directing and managing the technical and operational functions of other RADBN SIGINT\/EW assets. Additionally, TCAC provides a focal point for national, theater, and tactical data networks for data exchange with tactical SIGINT\/EW assets, the IAS and national databases. TCAC will enable the transfer of USMC tactical SIGINT collection and analytical data into the Real-Time Regional Gateway (RT-RG) and by producing DIB enabled products that will be discoverable by any DCGS enabled Marine. The system provides ground processing of Electronic Warfare (EW) information including EW Support and Electronic Attack (EA) data collected by the RADBN and JSF aircraft. The Cross Domain Solution also enables the TCAC to transfer approved and sanitized file types from Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) networks (e.g. JWICS\/NSAnet) to Marine Corps Enterprise Network-SIPR (MCEN-S) networks for delivery to Tactical Commanders."

Additionally, funding supports the collapsing of GEOINT\/Target Intelligence, hardware\/software baselines and sustaining and advancing critical technology investments in AI\/ML and intelligence cloud services. \n\nDCGS-MC All Source: $7.770M supports the procurement of hardware associated with the Tier II common components and Tier III technical fielding support.  The IAS program was previously funded in BLI 4747 in FY 2019 and prior.\n\nDCGS-MC SIGINT: $4.276M will procure the Transportable Work Station (TWS) hardware, fielding and initial engineering, and tech and management support. The TCAC program was previously funded in LI 4747 in FY 2019 and prior. \n\nFY 2021 Base Appropriation Request: $38.260M (active)\n\nDCGS-MC GEOINT: $23.571M will support the Common Data Link (CDL) Antenna Refresh.  Additionally, funding will support advancing GEOINT critical technology investments in AI\/ML and intelligence cloud services.  The $3.055M increase from FY 2020 to FY 2021 supports procurement and fielding of GEOINT hardware and software necessary to support Marine Corps Future Force 2025 intelligence structure increases, this will include the Contingency Operations (COOP) server stacks in support of MCISRE cloud initiative (eHUB).  \n\nDCGS-MC ALL SOURCE:  $8.228M will support the procurement of Common Intel Workstations, Fielding and Initial Engineering, and Tech and Management support for the Common Intel Server and software enhancements in support of Advanced Analytics Technical Solution (AATS).  $0.458M increase from FY 2020 to FY 2021 reflects software enhancements to the Advanced Analytics Technical Solution (AATS) required in order to keep pace with emerging technology and to meet the needs of Marine Corps Intelligence Analysts.  \n\nDCGS-MC SIGINT: $6.461M will procure Cross Domain Solution (CDS) hardware refresh, fielding and initial support, and software procurement for TCAC Family of Systems (FoS).

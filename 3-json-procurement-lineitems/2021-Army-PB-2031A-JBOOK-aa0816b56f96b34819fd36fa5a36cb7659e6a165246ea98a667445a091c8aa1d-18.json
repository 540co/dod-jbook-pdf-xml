            "val": "The RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a fixed-wing, airborne Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection and precision targeting location system. GRCS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify\/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. The Army's Acquisition Objective\/Army's Procurement Objective is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd Ml; and seven (7) fielded to the 204th Ml, and five (5) trainers within Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and INSCOM.  \n\nThis funding line supports Army RC-12X aircraft performing the AISR mission. It provides for the following: procurement and associated testing of civil and military aircraft equipment, future integration efforts, and procurement of replacement and spare engines and props. These modifications address all Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to current and evolving international and Army Standards. These modifications ensure continued worldwide deployment capability and safe operations. Lastly, this line supports future modifications in service.\n\nThe overall GRCS procurement\/modernization efforts are found in the following two lines: AZ2052 Guardrail Payloads (Aircraft Procurement Army (APA) Military Intelligence Program (MIP) P-1 Line #20) and A02111 GRCS SEMA MODS (Aircraft Procurement Army (APA) Military Intelligence Program (MIP) P-1 Line #23). Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Office for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors."

This line also funds the integration of ARC 201 Single Channel Ground Air Radio Systems (SINCGARS) kits to address modernization issues, and modifications to the communications suite.\n\nAll COMPO 1. In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

The ISSPA is the only means to collect COMSEC requirements, procure and field solutions, key management capabilities and Information Assurance (IA)\/ Cyber tools to secure the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) against growing Cyber threats.  The ISSPA supports the identification and allocation of new and emerging COMSEC capabilities required to protect Army's architectures and to replace current and legacy cryptographic systems with technologically advanced (network centric\/DoDIN compliant) devices.  These actions ensure Army keeps pace with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic modernization, advanced key management and network centric performance capability mandates."

Additionally, funds support COMSEC acquisition functions enabling Army to equip the force with critical cryptographic solutions and services during peacetime, wartime, and contingency operations."

            "val": "The Naval Tactical Command Support System (NTCSS) is a multi-function program designed to provide standard tactical support information systems to various afloat and associated shore-based fleet activities.  The mission is to provide the full range of responsive tactical support Automated Data Processing (ADP) hardware and software in support of the management of information, personnel, material and funds required to maintain and operate ships, submarines, and aircraft.  NTCSS is to provide an efficient management of afloat tactical support data, through the use of standardized hardware and software, to meet the mission support information management requirements for force sustainment.\n\nNTCSS incorporates the functionality of the Shipboard Non-Tactical ADP Program (SNAP) systems, the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS), and the Maintenance Resource Management System (MRMS).\n\nSNAP is an automated information system that supports organizational level maintenance, supply, financial and administrative functions on afloat units, at Marine Aviation Logistics Squadrons (MALS) and at associated shore activities.  SNAP improves equipment supportability and maintainability and thus readiness through:  improvement in the accuracy of maintenance, supply, financial and related support data maintained and reported by the ship; and acceleration of management report preparation and data transmission.  The scope of SNAP includes approximately 300 sites.\n\nNALCOMIS is an automated, real time, interactive, management information system that provides a modern management tool for day-to-day management of aircraft maintenance at the organizational and intermediate levels.  NALCOMIS automates management of the aviation repairables inventory, providing nose-to-tail tracking through the repair and operations cycles.  The scope of NALCOMIS includes 66 aviation intermediate maintenance activities located afloat (CVN\/LHA\/LHD\/MALS), at Naval Air Stations (NAS), and approximately 326 Navy and Marine Squadrons.\n\nMRMS is an automated information system that supports ship intermediate maintenance management of the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets.  MRMS supports Type Commands, Group Commanders, Area Coordinators, Readiness Support Groups, Submarine Squadrons, Ship Repair Facilities, and various Intermediate Maintenance Activities, both afloat and ashore, for budgeting, planning, production and analysis of ship maintenance.  MRMS improves ship readiness through improved maintenance and ship repair management, information resource management, and maintenance data processing.  The scope of MRMS includes approximately 16 shipboard and 65 shore based intermediate and maintenance and planning activities.\n\nDY005, Ship Set Equipment Upgrades procures afloat ruggedized, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) computing equipment, which includes servers to support the NTCSS application and database, personal computers (PCs) that will interface with the servers for maintenance and supply transactions, and printers to display output.  COTS software, which includes the operating system, comes loaded on the servers and PCs.\n\nDY006, MALS\/Shore Equipment Upgrades procures ashore ruggedized, COTS computing equipment, which includes servers to support the NTCSS application and database, PCs that will interface with the servers for maintenance and supply transactions, and printers to display output.  COTS software, which includes the operating system, comes loaded on the servers and PCs."

            "val": "Funding for FY18 procures:  1) NTCSS system upgrades for ships; 2) NTCSS system upgrades for Naval Air Stations (NAS), Squadrons, Shore Support Facilities, Fleet Training Centers, Marine Aviation Logistics Squadrons (MALS), Navy Expeditionary Combat Command sites, Special Warfare units, and Commander Naval Surface Forces; and 3) necessary production engineering and installation support.\n\nNTCSS-Optimized software will continue to be fielded at program-of-record (POR) afloat and ashore sites.  Ship set and MALS\/Shore equipment upgrades continue; hardware and software upgrades required for obsolescence avoidance."

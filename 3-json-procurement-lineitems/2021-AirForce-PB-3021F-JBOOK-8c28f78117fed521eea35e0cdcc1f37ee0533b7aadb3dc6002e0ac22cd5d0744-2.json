            "val": "In FY2021, P-1 Line Item CTRSPC\/Counterspace Systems efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nThe Counter Communications System (CCS) Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) program provides expeditionary, deployable, reversible offensive space control (OCS) effects applicable across the full spectrum of conflict. It prevents adversary satellite communications (SATCOM) in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Command and Control (C2), Early Warning, and Propaganda; and hosts Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to Urgent Needs. Acquisition Decision Memorandum (24 April 2009) directed all capabilities identified in the October 2006 CCS Block 20, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved Capability Development Document (CDD) shall be accomplished as P3I upgrades to the CCS Block 10.\n\nBounty Hunter (BH) supports the Defensive Space Control of US systems in several AORs and provides the capacity to prevent effective adversary use of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I). The system was originally a response to Joint Urgent Operational Need.  In 2013 AF Requirements Oversight Council directed incorporation of BH capabilities into a Program of Record. In March 2019, Bounty Hunter was designated as a Program of Record. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1206421F."

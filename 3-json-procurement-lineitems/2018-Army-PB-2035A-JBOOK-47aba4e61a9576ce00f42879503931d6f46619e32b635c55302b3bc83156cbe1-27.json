Tool load includes pneumatic nailer, blow gun, router, jig saw, 10\u201d table saw, 10\u201d circular saw, 14\u201d cut off saw, 12\u201d miter saw, nibbler, electric shears and tile cutter.   VSECK Type III replaces one legacy system through modernization, consolidation and optimization.  The legacy system this replaces does not meet current mission requirements and does not have any warranty associated with the current components. Army Acquisition Objective for Type III is 314.\n\nVSECK Type IV Electricians Tool Kit (ETK) enables 3 electricians to perform construction & maintenance tasks related to distribution & transmission of electrical power: interior & exterior lighting, installation & repair of lighting & wiring aboard ships.  Kit contains conduit benders, auger bits, pliers, knives, wood chisels, crimpers, tube & PVC cutters, key sets, levels multimeter, strippers, wrenches, ladders, electric saws & drills and flood lights.   VSECK IV replaces one legacy system through modernization, consolidation and optimization.  The legacy system this replaces does not meet current mission requirements and does not have any warranty associated with the current components. Army Acquisition Objective for Type IV is 928.\n\nVSECK Type V Mason and Concrete Tool Kit (MCTK)  includes brick hammers, levels, chalk line, rulers, plumb bobs, trowels, floats, bull floats, specialized floats, screeds, edger, groover, brooms, hoses & nozzles, mortar mixer, scaffolding, sealant sprayer, pliers, vibrator, cut-off saws, grinder, rebar cutters & benders, hacksaws, knee  boards, mortar boards & stands, buckets, brushes, laser level, come-a-long, tarps, hoes, rakes & shovels.  VSECK Type V replaces one legacy system through modernization, consolidation and optimization.  The legacy system this replaces does not meet current mission requirements and does not have any warranty associated with the current components.Army Acquisition Objective for Type V is 892.\n\nVSECK Type VI Plumbers and Pipefitters Tool Kit (PPTK) is specialized equipment required by a team of plumbers and pipefitters stock to perform construction and maintenance tasks working with metal, brass, aluminum, PVC or PEX. Contains hand tools enabling performance of individual & collective tasks related to heating & air conditioning, water distribution, waste water removal & solid waste removal. The tool load includes: hammers, hack saws, chisels, wrenches, pliers, putty knives, screwdrivers, saws, level plumb bob, tool box, ladder, powered saws & drills, pry & line up bars, tubing & pipe cutters, floodlight, key set, & plunger.

            "val": "This is an All Types line covering ground vehicle mounted or towed landmine detection, marking and neutralization systems. This Program Element contributes to Area Access (A2) to support unified land operations and improve soldier survivability. This line is used to procure Improvise Explosive Devices (IED) and landmine detection, interrogation, neutralization, protection, Area Access, route clearance and area clearance capabilities.  Procurement of improved detection, interrogation, neutralization and protection capabilities for mine, IED and Explosive Hazard threats are needed as technology becomes available.  \n\nThis exhibit contains the following programs:   \n\nExplosive Hazard Pre-Detonation (EHP)\nEHP provides the capability of a Roller System (on the Medium Mine Protected Vehicles (MMPV) Type II), Debris Blower (on the Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle), and Wire Neutralization (on the Husky based Vehicle Mounted Mine Detection system). EHP enhances route clearance capabilities while on the move to detect (by encounter), neutralize and survive against a full spectrum of explosive hazard landmines, IEDs, Explosively Formed Penetrator, unexploded ordnance, battlefield munitions and trigger their mechanisms while conducting route clearance operations.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the Roller System is 336, the Debris Blower is 176, and the Wire Neutralization System (WNS) is 128. \n\nMine Clearing Vehicle (MCV)\nThe M1271 Mine Clearing Vehicle is a medium, commercially available, blast protected, mechanical flail. The MCV is a manually controlled, self powered vehicle with an adjustable depth flail head designed to clear large areas of anti-tank and anti-personnel land mines.  The AAO for MCV is 41.\n\nRoute Clearance Virtual Clearance Training Suite (VCTS)\nThe VCTS provides soldiers at 14 sites the capability for virtual training on Route Clearance vehicles, EHP, and MCV systems.\n\nVehicle Optics Sensor System (VOSS) \nVOSS provides a telescoping, gyro-stabilized, high resolution, triple sensor (day camera, Image Intensify Night Vision Sensor and an Infrared Sensor) surveillance system to optically detect from standoff distances, explosive hazards (Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs) and landmines), and their trigger sources.  VOSS is mounted on MMPV located within Route Clearance Platoons and Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Companies. PM Ground Sensors is pursuing an acquisition approach which harvests Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) procured systems for refresh into the Program of Record (POR).  The refresh effort will be conducted at Tobyhanna Army Depot."

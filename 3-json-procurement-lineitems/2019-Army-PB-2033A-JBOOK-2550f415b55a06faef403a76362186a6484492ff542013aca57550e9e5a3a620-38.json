Funding will also purchase Non-Standard weapons to support the Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF) as well as world class Olympic Grade marksmanship weapons and accessories to support the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and Army National Guard to include Biathlon Teams to maintain and procure the specialized target rifles, pistols and accessories:  Air Rifles, 22 caliber Pistols and Rifles, Shooting glasses and scopes, Free Pistols, Shot Guns and bolt action rifles."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.174 million supports the Active Army by providing funding for M150 and M68 optics. The base funding also supports the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and National Guard Biathlon Teams.  The AMU competes worldwide on a regular basis.  The man\/weapon interface at this competitive level is important.   Between competitions the AMU fires constantly to hone their skills and maintain their competitive edge.  Weapons of all types are fired, and even with the extremely high level of maintenance provided, these weapons exceed their stated effective life projections faster.  This requires the weapons to be coded out and replaced regularly. Base funding will also provide for the procurement and training of various Non-Standard Weapons to support the regionally engaged Active Army.  These weapons are required to facilitate training of US Army units on host nation weapon systems prior to deployment in support of regionally aligned force missions.  Starting in FY2019 the Army will procure Biathlon  Rifles for the Army National Guard Biathlon Teams.  \n\nThe FY2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) dollars in the amount of $1.397 million supports COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI).  Funding will support the procurement of M150 and M68 optics.\n\nNew Starts : Biathlon Rifles will be procured for the Army National Guard Biathlon Teams.  Regionally Aligned Forces (RAF) weapons will also be procured as Non-Standard Weapons.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

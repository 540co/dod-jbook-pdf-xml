It is the command and control point for managing the training being conducted while the students are in the POW camp; it serves as the primary safety observation point for the training and is primary focal point for the POW camp scenario driven training.  The tower is in poor condition and needs to be replaced.\n\n[P40A \/ YPYAV - AUDIO\/VISUAL EQUIPMENT FOR JPME]: Naval War College (NWC) requires audio visual educational and research support equipment to complete P103 MILCON conversion of current Library  and underground garage parking spaces of Hewitt Hall into a integrated learning commons for the Naval War College, CNO's Strategic Studies Group and Command Leadership School.  This $12M MILCON project is in direct response to the repeat accreditation findings by Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff that NWC has inadequate spaces to support to student study and collaboration spaces.  Additionally CNIC has previously documented inadequate NWC facilities space for its mission requirements.  The project is also required because the library is considered a key mission deficit area, as cited by the CJCS during the last two accreditation Inspection.  To complete the renovations, the P-103 requires $376K of A\/V capabilities to make the Library and Learning commons spaces usable as intended for the MILCON renovation. A modern higher education institution must support the use of the most current instructional and pedagogical tools and technology to deliver and support a 21st century curriculum for the proper development of  21st century leaders.\n\n[P40A \/ YPYOE- OTH EQUIP: SPPT EQUIP & COMPUTER STATIONS]: Naval War College (NWC) requires audio visual educational and research support equipment to complete P103 MILCON conversion of current Library  and underground garage parking spaces of Hewitt Hall into a integrated learning commons for the Naval War College, CNO's Strategic Studies Group and Command Leadership School.  This $12M MILCON project is in direct response to the repeat accreditation findings by Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff that NWC has inadequate spaces to support to student study and collaboration spaces.  Additionally CNIC has previously documented inadequate NWC facilities space for its mission requirements.  The project is also required because the library is considered a key mission deficit area, as cited by the CJCS during the last two accreditation Inspection.  To complete the renovations, the P-103 requires $124K of A\/V capabilities to make the Library and Learning commons spaces usable as intended for the MILCON renovation. A modern higher education institution must support the use of the most current instructional and pedagogical tools and technology to deliver and support a 21st century curriculum for the proper development of  21st century leaders.\n\n[P40A \/ YPYIP - NPS- INTERNET PROTOCOL VERSION 6 (IPv6) INITIATIVE]: Upgrade Network, Telephone Switching and Education Delivery Systems to attain Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) compliance as mandated by OMB Memo to CIOs:  Transition to IPv6 September 28, 2010 and DoD and DoN directives.  This upgrade leverages BUPERS\/Naval Post Graduate School's (NPS) lifecycle replacement schedule to meet the mandates.  The current network electronics, telephone switch, and educational delivery systems have either reached or have exceeded end-of life in FY14.  These devices will be IPv6 capable and allow implementation of the external facing compliance requirement as well as establishing the platform to fully implement IPv6 capability on the internal network for secuirty, applications and web services.\n\n[P40A \/ YPYTD - TRAINING DELIVERY SERVICES (TDS)]: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Initiative. The training enterprise is moving forward with implementing more efficient technologies to meet the training delivery mission via a virtual desktop infrastructure solution. The virtual desktop solution will be implemented over the next several years at each location in lieu of conducting the traditional one-for-one workstation refresh. The goals and benefits of VDI are to establish an agile, sustainable enterprise training delivery environment; standardize the processes, services and technology used to deliver training; improve the enterprise security posture; refresh outdated electronic classroom workstations and operating systems; and provide a solution that enables a streamlined, centralized IT workforce.\n\n[P40A \/ ECR VDI IMPLEMENTATION (VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE)]: NETC requires OPN funding in support of meeting  the enterprise training delivery operations across the enterprise.  Funds are utilized on virtual solutions that enable NETC to meet the DoD\/DoN requirements ofconsolidating footprint while ensuring optimized performance of the desktops and servers in support of the Sailor 2025 and Ready, Relevant Learning.\n\n[P40A \/ YP010 - CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS (COOP)]: Continuity of Operations (COOP):  Existing IT infrastructure for training applications is insufficient to support the projected growth in content, users, and requirements for continuity of operations.  Funds will be used to expand the capacity of servers, storage, and networks in addition to providing fail-over capability in the data center for storage of data and application code at an alternate site. These systems are vital to the operational readiness and effectiveness of education and training.  Failure to make these investments could lead to immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness."

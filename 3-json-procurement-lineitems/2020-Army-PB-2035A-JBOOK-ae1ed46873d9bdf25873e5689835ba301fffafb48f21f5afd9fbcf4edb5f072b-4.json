            "val": "Joint Incident Site Communications Capability supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 4 - Command Post \n\nThe Joint Incident Site Communications Capability (JISCC) funding line procures the Disaster Incident Response Emergency Communications Terminal (DIRECT) capability. DIRECT provides communication to each of the 50 States and 4 Territories to meet the information exchange requirements of the States National Guard (NG) operational commanders while performing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions. The program leverages Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Cellular and Commercial Capabilities to provide seamless network connectivity to support first responders and emergency managers.\n\nDIRECT Capabilities consist of:\nCommercial Coalition Equipment (CCE): Provides commercial internet access to civilian and multinational partners  to reduce Size Weight and Power (SWaP) technology, thus fully addressing the increasingly high demand for accelerated capabilities. Interconnects disparate voice communications networks\/devices used by multiple response agencies at an incident site.\nCellular Solution (Commercial Wireless and 4th Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE)): Provides immediate cellular and wireless network connectivity to first responders, state authorities, and federal authorities allowing for enhanced Command and Control (C2) and shared situational awareness at an incident site."

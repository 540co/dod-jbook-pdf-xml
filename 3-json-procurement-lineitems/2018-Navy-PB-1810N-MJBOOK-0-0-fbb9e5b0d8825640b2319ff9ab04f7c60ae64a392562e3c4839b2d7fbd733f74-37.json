            "val": "The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission package enables the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) to conduct detect-to-engage operations against modern submarines that pose a threat. Specific ASW capabilities include protecting forces in transit, protecting joint operating areas, and establishing ASW barriers. ASW Modules are developed to provide the warfighter capabilities that can be employed for ASW area search as well as high value unit escort missions.  Module components include a torpedo countermeasures system, a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) and a Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA). The Aviation Module provides airborne threat localization and engagement capability through an MH-60R helicopter with MK54 torpedoes and the ability to incorporate a Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.\n\nAn ASW Mission Package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) and the full complement of mission systems that comprise the LCS ASW Mission Module (Line Item Number 1602). If mission systems are removed from the mission module in any given Fiscal Year, the ASW Mission Package will be non-deployable until the mission system is replaced in a subsequent Fiscal Year.\n\nThe number of LCS mission packages must not only keep pace with the number of ships, more are required to account for the mission packages that will be forward staged or unavailable due to periodic maintenance requirements.\n\nOther Related Budgets: BLIs: OPN 1600, OPN 1601, OPN 1603, RDT&E 0603596N\n\nASW MP Quantities Procured:\nPrior Years: ASW = 0\nFY 2016: ASW = 1 (RDTEN funded)\nFY 2017: ASW = 1\nFY 2018: ASW = 0\nFY 2019: ASW = 3\nFY 2020: ASW = 2\nFY 2021: ASW = 3\nFY 2022: ASW = 3\n\n\nTotal ASW MPs Delivered\/Deployable:\nPrior Years: ASW= 0\nFY 2016: ASW = 0\nFY 2017: ASW = 1\nFY 2018: ASW = 1\nFY 2019: ASW = 2\nFY 2020: ASW = 2\nFY 2021: ASW = 4\nFY 2022: ASW = 7\n\n[P5 \/ (AS001) - ASW Escort Module]: The ASW Escort Mission Module (MM) contains the sensors and signal processing required to detect, classify and localize submarine threats.  The Escort MM consists of two towed sensors; a VDS active source and an MFTA passive\/bi-static active receiver; launch, handling and recovery equipment for the towed sensors, and AN\/SQQ-89 V(15) active and passive signal processing applications.\n\n[P5 \/ (AS002) - Torpedo Defense Countermeasure Module]: The Light Weight Tow (LWT) system is a towed persistent torpedo countermeasure optimized for use in littoral conditions.  LWT is a standalone autonomous system capable of defeating threat torpedoes through soft-kill to independently increase LCS Platform Probability of Survival.\n\n[P5 \/ (AS005) - ASW Mission Package Containers]: The foundation of each ASW Support Container (SC) is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) compliant shipping container. The ISO shipping containers are outfitted with Unistrut rails (for shelving and drawer attachments), lighting (standard\/emergency), fire\/smoke alarms, service panels for power, and a circuit breaker box. From this base container configuration, a variety of racks, cradles, and handling gear can be installed as needed to form a SC.\n\n[P5 \/ (AS900) - Consulting Services]: Provides program management support, engineering and technical support, studies, analysis and evaluation on mission module systems."

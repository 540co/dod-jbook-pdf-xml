            "val": "Identity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC) is a multi-modal (fingerprint, iris and face) biometric collection system that provides the United States Marine Corps (USMC) a reliable and effective capability to collect, share, match, access, verify, and store identity information. IDS-MC will enable the Marine to collect appropriate biometric, biographical and reference information on an individual and match this locally developed information with pre-existing information available to the expeditionary force. The system will display match results with linkage to the respective individual's biographical and reference information as well as help to analyze the response, update records as appropriate, create reports, and disseminate updated information in accordance with current Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) policy. The primary mission of IDS-MC is to provide the MAGTF with the means to identify persons encountered in the battlespace. While IDS-MC is not an intelligence analysis system, it does provide identification information in support of military intelligence and law enforcement operations by providing positive identification of persons of interest. IDS-MC is an enabler in the areas of detainee management and questioning, base access, counterintelligence screening, border control, law enforcement, displaced persons' management and aiding in humanitarian assistance missions. IDS-MC supports the tactical application of identity dominance and fully supports a forward presence, crisis response and contingency response capability.\n\nExpeditionary Forensic Exploitation Capability (EFEC) is a portable, expeditionary laboratory capable of conducting Level I and II forensics analysis of captured enemy material, evidence and information. It is comprised of 4 Table of Authorized Material Control Numbers (TAMCN), which include Chemical, Media, and Site Exploitation, and a Laboratory kit."

            "val": "Prior to FY19, IDS-MC funding is included in BLI 6438, Physical Security Equipment.\n\nFY2018 Base Appropriation Request: N\/A\n\nFY2019 Base Appropriation Request: $0.971M\n\nIdentity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC): $0.971M to initiate procurement of the hardware and software for IDS-MC Increment 2 in accordance with a MS C\/FRP procurement decision. FY19 increase is due to realignment from BLI 6438 to 4652. Realignment of effort to new BLI in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR.\n\nFY2020 Baseline Appropriation Request: $4.945M\n\nIdentity Dominance System-MC (IDS-MC): $4.945M will procure the full system (Hardware and Software) for IDS-MC Increment 2. IDS-MC Increment 2 is a multi-modal identity system that provides the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) the ability to collect, match, store, and share biometric data in support of operations. The IDS-MC program strategy is evolutionary, structured to deliver capabilities incrementally, recognizing the need for future capability improvements.  The increase from FY19 to FY20 is due to the procurement of full system hardware and associated software.\n\nOCO: \nFY2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Request:  $0.750M\n\nExpeditionary Forensic Exploitation Capability (EFEC) will procure hardware for replacement of legacy obsolete IT equipment and other peripherals such as Sabre 5000 Handheld Trace Detectors for explosives, chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals and narcotics.  Forensics Exploitation has become a key capability in counter insurgency (COIN) warfare.  This system provides the Marine Corps the ability to provide the Combatant Commander with required Identity Operations\/Biometrics\/Forensics capabilities identified in COCOM CONOPS, CONPLANS\/OPLANS, and Theater Campaign Plans in support of the Joint Force requirement."

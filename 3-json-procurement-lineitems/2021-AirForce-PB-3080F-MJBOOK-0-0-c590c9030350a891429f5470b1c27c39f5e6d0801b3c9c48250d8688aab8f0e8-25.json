This program procures GCCS components which include, but are not limited to, items such as servers, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and associated peripherals to provide users with the full suite of joint baseline capability (including the common operating picture and Integrated Imagery & Intelligence). GCCS-AF is integrated at the following locations to establish initial and full joint connectivity and operational capability across the spectrum of intelligence, operations, war planning, manpower, and logistics: AF-supported war-fighting commands, AF critical sites, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major Command headquarters (MAJCOM), numbered air forces, wings, Air National Guard (ANG) bases, Air Force Reserve (AFR) bases, and remote sites. Each site will comply with current Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) network initiatives by employing a standardized interface among AF base-level classified C2 networks, AF base-level network control centers, and the joint Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This program provides a flexible open system and distributed C2 architecture necessary to support the joint GCCS. GCCS supports AF operations by installing and upgrading a site's classified C2 system through extensive use of COTS technology that adheres to AF command and control, communications, and computer architectures and standards. \n\nFunding for the exhibit contained in PE 0303150F: GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe FY 21 funding request was reduced by $1.719 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

GCCS-AF will procure and install GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J) version 6.0 hardware and software (government-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf) at warfighter Combatant Command (CCMD) and MAJCOM locations, providing a full spectrum of command, control, war planning, logistics, and intelligence capability from strategic to unit level operations with total joint service connectivity. The GCCS architecture supports functional users on each base and specifically incorporates war planning functions into GCCS. These fielding activities are consistent with the AF's Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) C2 structure and integration with DoD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler."

The cable connectors, which were installed in DTRA facilities a decade ago, are no longer manufactured, supported, or available on the market, causing compatibility issues with new end-user devices as well as network switching and routing equipment;\n     -  IT infrastructure core routing and switching, DTRA Experimentation Lab\/Reachback systems, analytical equipment for CBWMD search missions, and the life-cycle replacement of DIAMONDS enterprise server equipment located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; and\n     -  Continued support to the NACT program for IMS component replenishment and monitoring system acquisition necessary to meet on-going operational responsibilities.\n\nThe FY 2019 budget of $5,592 thousand will fund the following new and continuing efforts:\n     -  Chemical Biological (CB) analytical equipment kits\/hardware for the Computer Network Defense Tool, expanding DTRA's capability to execute cyber vulnerability scanning in support of Balanced Survivability Assessments (BSAs);\n     -  Enterprise records management application, making DTRA compliant with Presidential OMB Directive M-12-18.  The directive is requesting federal agencies to manage all permanent electronic records in an electronic format by the year 2019;\n     -  Information technology enhancements to the DTRA Experimentation Laboratory supporting Technical Reachback;\n     -  IT Infrastructure; and \n     -  Continues support for the NACT program to meet on-going operational responsibilities through the recapitalization of U.S. IMS stations, ensuring the continued delivery of nuclear explosion monitoring data in support of U.S. and DoD objectives.\n\nThe decrease from FY 2018 to FY 2019 reflects completion of the one-time cable plant infrastructure lifecycle replacement bringing DTRA's cable plant up to current industry standards and revised acquisition strategy for cloud services."

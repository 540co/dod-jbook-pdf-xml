            "val": "Items Less Than $5 Million (Maintenance Equipment):  Acquire and field maintenance support equipment, such as the Machinist Measuring Tool Set (MMTS),  Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP), Refrigeration Tool Kit Type I and Type II with improved, modernized, standardized, and centralized maintenance Sets, Kits, Outfits, and Tools (SKOT).\n  \nThe Machinist Measuring Tool Set (MMTS) provides necessary components for general machinist's use.  The MMTS facilitates fabrication, repair, and modifications of metallic and nonmetallic parts, and supports metalworking shop activities.  The MMTS supplements the Metal Working & Machining Shop Set (MWMSS) by providing an authorized set of hand tools and personal protective equipment necessary for the 91E Soldier to conduct welding and machining operations.The set consists of a tool box and 73 components (i.e. gauges, calipers, rulers, hammer, punches, etc.). Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for MMTS is 2511.\n\n\nThe Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP) maintenance equipment enables units to properly maintain equipment and perform the mandatory maintenance operations as well as perform diagnostics and post-verification testing on all small and medium tactical generators (2 to 60 kw) which enable readiness of weapons systems.  This equipment allows Soldiers to properly and adequately maintain reliable systems that meet Soldier safety, supportability, and mobility requirements, thereby reducing the risk to the warfighter.\nThe Load Bank System is a key maintenance enabler for the Tactical Electric Power (TEP) generator sets. TEP generator sets provide power to critical life saving operations such as field hospitals that provide medical support to combat wounded soldiers, satellite and land communication systems to communicate with Soldiers in convoys and foot patrols, Tactical Operation Centers and various Soldier life support operations. The Load Bank is a critical maintenance tool for TEP generators. It is a Soldier-portable system required for performing diagnostics, repairs and post verification testing on all small and medium tactical generators of the Army's tactical fleet. Load Banks are required to: verify the generator can provide clean uninterrupted  power output without electrical fluctuations which can injure soldiers and damage Army equipment, perform accurate diagnostic, repair, scheduled maintenance, troubleshooting and post repair performance verification testing; verify that small and medium generator sets can provide 100% of rated power output; allows maintainers to 'burn out' fuel\/carbon accumulations due to under-loading the generator set for extended periods. The capability that Load Banks provide to load test generator sets is an essential function that Army maintenance units require to support combat and peacetime operations. This is an Army requirement expressed in generator set field level maintenance technical manuals. There is a recognized Table of Equipment (TOE)\/Modified TOE (MTOE) requirement for TEP generator sets. Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP) is 1270.\n\nThe Refrigeration Tool Kit (RTK) consists of two kits, the individual Soldier kit (Type I) and the base kit (Type II).  These kits provide the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 91C Utilities Equipment Repairer Soldiers all the tools and equipment required to test, maintain and repair every environmental Control Unit (ECU) on and off the battlefield.  Proper functioning ECUs facilitate hospital\/medical activities such as laboratory operations, blood banks, aiding mortuary affairs, safe transportation and storage of perishable foods; providing environmentally-controlled conditions for troops, signal, and command\/control equipment; and Humanitarian Support, Disaster Relief and homeland Support Security deployments.  The RTK operates in all environments where United States Armed Forces deploy.  The RTK provides field level maintenance for all Army equipment that requires an Environmental Control Unit (ECU).  The RTK provides the capability to support maintenance operations as far forward as possible on the battlefield by providing on-system maintenance repairs to Army equipment and\/or components, which allows major combat systems to return to the fight rapidly.  RTK Type I Army Acquisition Objective (AAO)  4762 and Type II 2655"

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY18 Base funding in the amount of $1.015 million will procure 175 Machinist Measuring Tool Sets,  $1.273 million will procure 202 Load Bank System Tactical Electric Power (TEP), $.260 million will procure 26 RTK - Individual Soldier Kit, and  $.180 million will procure 6 RTK - Base Kit. \n\nThe maintenance equipment is essential for units to properly maintain equipment, perform the mandatory maintenance operations and perform diagnostic testing which maintains the readiness of weapons systems. This equipment allows Soldiers to properly and adequately maintain vehicles and systems. Properly maintained systems perform at maximum capability, with improved safety and reduced risk to the warfighter. This equipment supports combat operations, Army Forces and unit Mission Essential Task List (METL) requirements. The Army requires reliable systems that support Soldier safety, supportability, and mobility requirements. SKOT systems require continuous review, revision, and upgrades to support Army requirements.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), these item are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

The CATV will employ four carrier variants: General purpose carrier variant capable of providing transport for not less than 9 Soldiers, plus the driver within a cab\/enclosure (10 Soldiers) with equipment and supplies to sustain three days of combat operations. Ambulance capable of transporting medical equipment, two caregivers, and not less than two litter patients or four ambulatory patients in addition to the driver within a cab\/enclosure. Command and Control (C2) providing the space weight and power to hosting standard Joint communications and common operating picture (COP) platforms. The C2 and COP equipment should be able to be used enroute or with minimal setup upon halt by six Soldiers in addition to the driver within a cab\/enclosure. Cargo\/flatbed capable of carrying outsized equipment and cargo. The cargo variant should allow for loading cargo with a forklift from either side (i.e. dropside or flatbed configuration) and have a cab\/enclosure for two Soldiers (driver and vehicle commander)."

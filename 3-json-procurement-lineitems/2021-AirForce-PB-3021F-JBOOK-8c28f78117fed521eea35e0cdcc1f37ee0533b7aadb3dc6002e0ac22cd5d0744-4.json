        "Description": {
            "val": "The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997), and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.\n\nWGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3. WGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites are designed with slight modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  A United States-Australia WGS partnership was codified in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 14 November 2007.  WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) consists of satellites 7-10. WGS Satellite vehicles 1-10 have all successfully launched.\n\nIn the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY 2018, Congress added $600.0M SPAF in FY 2018 for \"full funding for WGS 11 and 12.\"  A sole source Request for Proposal was released to Boeing in June 2018.  The Air Force assesses the procurement of WGS-11+, with twice the operational capacity of WGS-10, as the best approach to delivering the directed additional WGS capacity in a cost effective manner.  An Undefinitized Contract Action was awarded in April 2019 for the WGS 11+ satellite.  International Partnerships are being explored in support of WGS 11+, Checkout and Launch, etc. \n \nCurrent International Partnerships: Australia provided funds to buy WGS-6 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (satellites 1-6) resources. A multilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand was codified in an MOU in January 2012.  Norway and the Czech Republic joined the multilateral partnership in mid-2017.  The United States' contributions include existing and programmed infrastructure, to include the acquisition, launch, operations, and sustainment costs of WGS 1-8, and the launch, operations, and sustainment of WGS-9.  Other Partners' contributions funded WGS-9 acquisition and support activities.  Each Partner provided funds needed to buy WGS-9 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (satellites 1-9) resources commensurate with its level of contribution. \n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space & Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified\/classified enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new or repurpose capabilities.\n\nAs of the FY 2016 PB submission, space programs' satellite procurement funding has been re-categorized from Appropriation 3020, Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF), to Appropriation 3021, SPAF, in FY 2016 and beyond.  Total MPAF\/SPAF procurement funding is $3,768.939M.  Total WGS SV1-SV5 MPAF funds are $1,619.426M.  There are no WGS SV1-SV5 SPAF funds.  Total WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) MPAF\/SPAF funds are $2,149.513M. The total WGS B2FO procurement funding includes the FY 2018 $600M congressional add for WGS 11-12.\n    \nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203600F.    \n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation funding in PE 1206433F."

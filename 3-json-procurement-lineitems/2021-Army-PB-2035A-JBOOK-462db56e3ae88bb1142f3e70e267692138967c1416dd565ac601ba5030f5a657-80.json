            "val": "GCSS-Army Increment 1 gives combat forces a decisive edge by providing soldiers a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure logistics information to get combat power at the right place, at the right time.  GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan.  The GCSS-Army program has two components; a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component provided by the Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP) Hub.  \n\nGCSS-Army Increment 2 builds on the current foundation by providing auditable Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence\/Business Warehouse (BI\/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities and will sunset legacy systems:  the Aircraft Notebook and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS).   Increment 2 will establish a single disconnected operations architecture for GCSS-Army to support the ground and aviation missions.   Increment 2 will deliver greater efficiencies to Aviation Logistics warfighters and improved information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield."

Currently the Army has battlefield gaps without network connectivity:  inability to maintain or regenerate combat power, order\/process spare parts, track battle losses, or conduct maintenance.  The SAP licenses to stand up a disconnected architecture will alleviate these problems when there are disruptions in communications or cyber-attacks.\n\n$1.998 million supports AESIP and will be used to purchase hardware and software products required for new data management initiatives and data analysis such as the Chief of Staff of the Army Commander's Dashboard:\nSplunk HW procurement (includes server hardware\/storage) = $988,000\nSplunk SW procurement (includes professional services) = $310,000\nCisco Nexus 7000 F3-Series 48 Port 10GbE Ethernet Modules (to comply with IAVA 2019-A-0353) = $700,000\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

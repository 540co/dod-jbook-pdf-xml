        "Description": {
            "val": "This program procures and fields Scope Command High Frequency (HF) radio equipment, network infrastructure, and transmit\/receive antennas for 13 strategically located ground stations worldwide. All hardware and software, including radios and antennas, is commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) with the exception of the software that provides the military functionality required for the COTS equipment to operate as a HF radio system. This software is a COTS-based product that has been configured for the DoD to provide the unique capabilities required. The need for modern, robust, and dependable stations with beyond line of sight radio coverage has been identified to ensure HF radio communications is available in additional areas of interest to the United States.\n\nHigh Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS) is the only global, strategic high-power HF Command and Control (C2) network serving the Department of Defense (DoD). HFGCS consists of the two major components: the radio\/ network infrastructure (Scope Command) and the antennas (Antenna Program Support) which communicate with mobile assets (aircraft, Navy ships, Coast Guard ships). HFGCS supports aircrews, ground forces, naval operations, and control stations and is the primary C2 resource for Air Mobility Command cargo and tanker aircraft. Additional customers include White House Communications Agency (WHCA), Defense Communications System HF Entry, US Navy High Command Network, and other US government agencies. HFGCS supports war plan dissemination and daily operational requirements for WHCA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), US Strategic Command, National Military Command Center's Emergency Action Message distribution, Special Air Mission communications, Nuclear Command, Control & Communications (NC3), Major Air Force Commands and Combatant Commanders. HFGCS provides radio connectivity to other governmental organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the State Department. The HFGCS network supports Overseas Contingency Operations by providing secure, robust, physically diverse terrestrial and airborne transmission paths providing information services between fixed and deployed operating locations. HFGCS has also been identified as a key communications component in supporting operations in an anti-access area-denial (A2AD) environment.\n\nThe HFGCS program recently updated system consoles to replace end-of-life components and to provide increased system security and operations capabilities. The program also installed additional radios at HFGCS stations to consolidate with US Navy operations, allowing the Navy to close obsolete HF stations. FY18 funds Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) external interfaces to replace the obsolete switches and communications infrastructure supporting C2 operations, Direct Mission Support\/Program Management Administration (DMS\/PMA), System Engineering, Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC) Installation Testing and shipping costs for these procurement efforts.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0303133F.\n\nMilitary Necessity:  Controlled Item will be funded with investment funds to purchase military communications equipment classified as critical protection items."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "1. SCOPE COMMAND RADIO\/NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE: The Scope Command Radio\/Network Infrastructure requires continuous sustainment to replace technically obsolete and logistically unsupportable equipment to maintain existing capability. These projects continue the implementation of updated COTS radio and console capabilities into the HFGCS network. The current projects update the system efficiencies within radio operations and mission control, as well as maintain interoperability and compatibility with the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). The HFGCS FY18 program supports three main projects within the Scope Command Radio\/Network Infrastructure Program and continues the Antenna Replacement program. The FY18 HFGCS Network Infrastructure program includes the Audio Communications Functionality (ACF) Phase II, Hekimian Systems Test Equipment Replacement and the Receive Matrix Replacement.\n\nA. The ACF program provides updated audio functionality at an individual HFGCS radio station by replacing the obsolete Digital Electronic Switch (DES), as neither the DES nor Liberty Star-3 (LS-3) switch is on the Approved Product List. The use of these switches also limits the ability to maintain information assurance certification for HFGCS. Removing the IDPX-1000 DES and LS-3 from the HFGCS and replacing them with Open Architecture, non-proprietary, commercially available, modular components ensures the circuit interfaces are compatible with DISA architecture evolution as identified in the DISN Technical Evolution Plan and the DISN Overarching Technical Strategy 2011. This follows the effort in FY17 which demonstrates the Network Control Station capability. Installation of the final ACF capability will be in FY20-21. This continues the transition of the HFGCS network from an analog based to internet protocol (IP) based network.\n\nB. FY18 funding purchases replacement system test equipment for installation in the 13 stations and will update the existing Control and Management System (CCMS) software to control the replacement equipment. The existing Hekimian System Test Equipment is obsolete and no longer supportable by the manufacturer. The test equipment is critical to maintaining operational capability of the radio and antenna equipment for efficient operation. \n\nC. FY18 funding purchases 15 new Receive Matrices and installs them at the 13 stations, with one installation at the Systems Integration Lab and 1 spare. The funding will also update existing CCMS software to control the new Receive Matrix. The existing receive matrices have become obsolete and there are no longer spare parts manufactured to maintain the capability to interface between the radios and antennas.\n\nD. Next Generation Console\/Unified Capabilities: No Budget Year (FY18) funding requested..\n\n2. HIGH FREQUENCY GLOBAL ANTENNA REPLACEMENT: A majority of the HFGCS system antennas have been in operation for 25 to 40 years and have been subjected to degradation due to exposure to severe environmental conditions, salt water, and hurricane force winds. FY18 funds continue the replacement of critical antennas at HFGCS sites; actual locations and antenna selections will be based on technical assessment of the antenna condition and the operational requirements of the weapon system during execution. Planned replacements for FY18 have been identified at Ascension, Croughton, and Offutt. Additionally mandatory surveys will be conducted to prepare for future antenna installations at Lajes, West Coast, Puerto Rico, Sigonella, Elmendorf, Yokota, and Hawaii scheduled for follow-on efforts. \n\n3. FY18 funds for program management administration costs will provide financial management, engineering and technical support for the program office. FY18 also funds Direct Mission Support, including support associated with equipment installation, engineering, technical orders, sustainment engineering, shipping, and implementation. This includes interoperability testing and technical interchange meetings."

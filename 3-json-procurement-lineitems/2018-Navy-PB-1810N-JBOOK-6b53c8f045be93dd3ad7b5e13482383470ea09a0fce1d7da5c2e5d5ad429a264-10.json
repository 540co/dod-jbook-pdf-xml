            "val": "Note: Efforts within this budget line were consolidated from BLI's 1320, 2762, and 5662 in FY16 and prior.\n\nThis line provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment.  Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.\n\n[P40A \/ LCS SEAFRAME SIMULATORS]: Funds procure Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) training simulators and equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) in Newport, Rhode Island. Simulators are needed to meet the Train to Qualify Train to Certify  (T2Q\/T2C) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers and the installation of this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) in each homeport and at SWOS. Trainers are required for each ship variant, with initial procurements for the San Diego homeport and SWOS, followed by procurements for the Mayport homeport within the FYDP. Throughput of LCS crews requires more than one simulator of each variant in a homeport.\n\n1.1) LCS Virtual Reality Labs & Networks - Funds comprehensive network infrastructure and computing environment and Virtual Reality Labs (VRLs), within the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) to support delivery and management of all components of LCS Training. Without the VSTS network infrastructure, no systems within the LTF (currently being built in San Diego, and funded for Mayport) will interoperate or communicate with each other.  Both LTFs are being built and designed around a central computer server farm that houses all courseware, training scenarios, and student records.  Without the network infrastructure, there is no way to distribute the required courseware and software around the LTF, making the building essentially unusable.  Without the VRLs, there is no method of presenting previously developed Immersive Virtual Ship Environment (IVSE) courseware to students. Modernization efforts include regular\/scheduled updates\/upgrades to VSTS and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, along with the procurement of replacement Virtual Reality Lab (electronic classroom) equipment.\n\n1.2) LCS Mission Bay Trainers & Modernization - Enable the qualification, training, and team certification of the individuals and teams working in the Mission Bay.  Scenarios include prepping and launching\/recovering of mission module off-hull remote vehicles and operating of the cranes, doors, and other associated equipment in the Mission Bay.  They include full-scale replicas of the Mission Bay for both variants.  Without the Mission Bay Trainer, there will be no homeport training in the Mission Bay operations for the San Diego or Mayport-based crews and detachments during training pipeline, or off-hull, rapid refresh crew team training, and the primary warfare area (the Mission Bay) for the LCS ships will have no shore-based, controlled training capability in San Diego and Mayport, in this high-risk area of Mission Bay operations.  \n\n1.3 & 1.4) LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers & ITT Modernization - These are full scale simulators and\/or stimulations of Tactical Software enabling integrated team training of Bridge, Combat Systems, Engineering, and Mission Package systems\/watch stations. The quantity and type (based on variant) of trainers in San Diego and Mayport is dependent on the Navy's Strategic Laydown of the Littoral Combat Ships.  Follow on ITT procurements (FY16 and follow) will include integrated crew served weapon simulators (discussed below).  If the ITTs are not funded, there is no way for the LCS crews and detachments to train in-port, as the LCS ships do not have an onboard training system.  Without the shore-based trainers, the ships must get underway, and use real targets and Fleet assets, such as drones, and training aircraft for all of their training.  The LCS Concept of Operations does not support such at-sea intensive training requirements.  Modernization efforts include regular\/scheduled updates and upgrades to the ITTs and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, as well as new consoles, joy sticks and communication equipment. IAW draft maturing Life Cycle Sustainment Plan for Trainers, Integrated Tactical Trainers (ITTs) require first upgrade to keep current with changing ship configurations five years after delivery of the trainer, and every two years after  FY18 provides the second installment of funding for the INDEPENDENCE ITT in San Diego. \n\n1.5 & 1.6)  Bridge Trainers - Devices that permit selected aspects of Bridge tasks (including Readiness Control Officer [RCO] tasks) to be practiced independently of Combat Systems Operations as found in more capable ITTs. This facilitates more efficient accomplishment of T2Q and T2C objectives. This trainer supports Officer training pipeline at SWOS, Newport in support of Division Officer, Department Head, and PXO\/PCO training pipeline for Officer of the Deck Training and rapid refresh and skills enhancement in Mayport.\n\n1.7) Crew Served Weapons Simulators - Funds support tactical deployment of small arms weapons stations topside. Crew Served weapons simulators will be integrated into procurement of follow-on ITTs. Without these simulators installed and integrated with the Integrated Tactical Trainers, the crew's tactical teams have no way to exercise ashore their Surface Warfare Detect-to-Engage sequence. The LCS ships are built to operate close to land. Proper execution and employment of their small arms (.50 Cal) are critical to the safety of the ship, and her crew.\n\n1.8) Combat Systems Part Task Trainers (C2 PTT) (LCS 1 and LCS 2) .  These devices permit training in selected aspects of Combat Systems Operations that are found in the more capable ITTs, to support individual skills development and practice, reduce the wear and tear on the ITTs, and allow the ITTs to more efficiently accommodate team training and certifications.\n\n[P40A \/ LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers & ITT Modernization]: In accordance with draft maturing Life Cycle Sustainment Plan for Trainers, Integrated Tactical Trainers (ITTs) require first upgrade to keep current with changing ship configurations five years after delivery of the trainer, and every two years after.  This provides the second installment of funding for the INDEPENDENCE ITT in San Diego.\n\n[P40A \/ MB040 - BFTT SHIP SETS]: Note: FY16 BFTT Ship Set Procurements are installed in FY17. The procurements costs are shown in FY16 in the BLI 2762 budget.\n\n[P40A \/ CVN 78 Class Training Equipment]: This provides for several initiatives oriented to developing the formal life cycle training solutions for multiple mission critical CVN 78 contractor furnished equipment (CFE) systems. Funds procure CVN 78 Class training simulators and equipment for the applicable Navy Education and Training Command Centers of Excellence to achieve Ready For Training (RFT). In particular, the CFE items procured include: training simulators, ship system mock-ups, electronic classrooms, intelligent tutoring systems, and all engineering and facilities upgrades necessary for installation at the training facilities. Simulators are needed to meet warfighter mission and safety readiness requirements of the Naval Aviation Carrier Training Manual. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers' hardware and software for future installation at the applicable Centers of Excellence in Norfolk, Great Lakes, and at SWOS Newport. Trainers are required for each major new CVN 78 specific system, with initial procurements for the Norfolk homeport and SWOS, followed by procurements for the Great Lakes training center and the homeport of San Diego. This funding represents initial training systems procurement for Advanced Weapons Elevator (AWE), Machinery Control and Monitoring System (MCMS), valve actuators, Solid State Voltage & Frequency Converter (SSVFC), Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) System, video network, Voice Telephone System (VTS), Zonal Electrical Distribution System (ZEDS), Oxygen (O2) Systems, Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS), Steering Gear Control System (SGCS). Additionally, this funding supports all associated site preparations and installation costs for the procured training systems. The Formal Life Cycle Training program provides training delivery for effective warfighter skills required for safe operations and maintenance of the ship.  There is no schoolhouse established for any of these new CFE systems being introduced on the CVN 78.\n\n[P5 \/ TS004 Surface Training Device Mods]: This line provides funds to procure, modify and upgrade trainers to include Aegis Weapon Systems, Aegis Ashore, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), DDG 1000, Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), and other Surface Warfare related Training Programs; Navigation, Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E),  combat systems, engineering, damage control and amphibious warfare individual and team Technical Training Equipment, Training Devices, Training Unique Equipment, Training systems, and the Surface Training Advanced Virtual Environment (STAVE). STAVE methodology provides students with an immersive and interactive learning environment as well as hands-on training equipment as part of a blended solution, which accelerates learning, improves student performance, and supports both CNO High Velocity Learning and Ready Relevant Learning intent. Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan (SEWTP). Additionally, funds support establishment and improvement of ship on-board training curriculum for the purpose of maintaining perishable operator and maintenance skills.\n\n[P5 \/ Navigation Trainers]: NAVIGATION TRAINERS - Funds are provided for modifications\/upgrades to Navigation Shore Based Trainers.\n\n[P5 \/ AEGIS Ashore Trainer\/C4I\/Tech Refresh]: AEGIS ASHORE TRAINER\/C4I\/Tech Refresh -Funds modernization, delivery, installation and life-cycle maintenance support of a high fidelity Aegis Ashore Team Trainer in support of the land-based Aegis Ashore Training Continuum.  Funds also provide for the integration of a C4I component, BMD Upgrades, and tech refresh.  Also funds the training system to train Navy Sailors who will man European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) land-based BMD facilities in Poland and Romania. The Aegis Ashore Team Trainer (AATT) at Dam Neck, VA will serve as the single site for individual watch team tactical training, certification events, and sustainment training for Aegis Ashore rotational crews assigned to AA BMD Host Nation Sites.\n\n[P5 \/ Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT)]: Combined Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)\/Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) Trainer (CIAT): From the Aegis Weapon System\/SPY Radar Readiness Task Force, Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) sponsored Fleet Integrated Air and Missile Defense and Anti-Submarine Warfare Improvement Programs, Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA), and C5I training requirements documents, one of the areas identified for long term investment was to meet the requirement for a high fidelity integrated air and missile defense and anti-submarine warfare training capability. Due to the cost and operations prohibitive realities associated with modifying onboard training systems, which currently meet only 60% of the CNO requirement for ship training systems to be commensurate with tactical system capability, this shore-based, high fidelity trainer is being procured and installed to emulate most current AEGIS Baseline 9 configurations. The CIAT High Fidelity trainer includes all necessary tactical IAMD, ASW and Electronic Warfare (EW) systems, associated hardware and work stations, the simulation and stimulation software and network hardware, training brief\/debrief capabilities and instructor operating control system. Due to the complexity and size of the system being procured , a spiral procurement and installation process will be utilized and executed in stages to maximize training capabilities that align with Fleet requirements. The CIAT will field in the Fleet Concentration Areas of San Diego and Norfolk in support of program of record Phase II, Advanced Warfare Training (AWT). The effort began in FY 14 and supports procurement and installation of two systems across the FYDP.  Funds also include costs associated with tactical and other software licensing, Information Assurance, computer program procurements and patches to ensure alignment with DON CIO Cyber requirements and ship tactical modernization.\n\n[P5 \/ Navy Training System Plan (NTSP TTE\/TD Mods)]: Funds procurement, installation, and upgrades for surface and expeditionary training systems in multiple Fleet Concentration Areas (FCA) in accordance with the results of CNO directed and OPNAV and Fleet sponsored studies, NTSP updates, and Technical Training Audits from 2011 through 2016. One of the key items identified in the Fleet Review Panel of Surface Force Readiness, LPD 17 Class Wholeness Task Force, Navigation Wholeness Study, Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV)-sponsored Surface Engineering Training Wholeness Review, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Front End Analysis (FEA), DDG 1000 wholeness review, and LHD 8\/ LHA 6 MPT analyses done by the Surface Warfare Enterprise was the outdated or lack of training equipment in the schoolhouses. Based on this analysis, funding supports requirements identified in approximately 80 Navy Training System Plan updates and 130 Technical Training Course Audits. This investment will be for the procurement and installation of Training Equipment at Learning Centers to keep training courses in alignment with current configuration of equipment in the fleet.

                        "val": "The Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT)\/Advanced Training Domain (ATD)\/Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) family of systems provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict; realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas; a means to link ships together which are in different homeports for coordinated training; external stimulation of shipboard training systems; and simulation of non-shipboard forces. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT uses a distributed architecture, integrating existing training systems, and uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Strike Group\/Battle Force (SG\/BF) Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Groups (ATGs), the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Training (FSTs)\/Live Virtual Constuctive (LVC) exercises. The Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) integrates existing and emergent onboard training and assessment system capabilities to simulate realistic, \"train like you fight\", combat-like conditions across weapon sensor and combat systems. Migration to TSTC improvements is required to ensure continued, persistent FST\/LVC interoperability to deliver training that is commensurate with tactical capabilities. Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Obsolescence mitigates replacement and upgrade of obsolete and out-of-production COTS components in BFTT systems installed throughout the Fleet to include the AN\/USQ-T46D upgrade. BFTT T46D and ATD\/T52 are core components of the TSTC.\n\nBFTT T46D Ship set configurations vary depending on AEGIS or SSDS installation.  T46D's for SSDS include additional materials and units to be integrated for stimulation of the ships sensors.\n\nFY17 - TSTC\/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (19) T46D's and subsequent variants of hardware and software Build 5.x series in support of AN\/SQQ-89 upgrades, AEGIS Baseline 9 upgrades and SSDS upgrades. Installation funding supports installation of (11) BFTT AN\/USQ-T46D Systems.\n\nFY18 - TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (9) T46D's and (2) T52's and subsequent variants of hardware and software Build 5.x series in support of AN\/SQQ-89 upgrades, and ATD software builds in support of AEGIS Baseline 9 TI-16 upgrades and SSDS upgrades -- which drives the difference in unit cost. Installation funding supports installation of (19) BFTT AN\/USQ-T46D Systems.  Additional costs will be incurred to procure more materials needed to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with NCTE to meet shipboard integrated training demands.\n\nIncreased materials and quantities installed in FY18 are required to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with NCTE to meet shipboard integrated training demands."

            "val": "Description:\nThe impact of the FY20 Congressional mark resulted in the elimination of 1 LOS ANGELES class replacement battery, elimination of the planned tray set, deferral of recapitalization efforts at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) battery shop, and reduced funding of Battery Monitoring Systems (including ABMS tech refresh).\n\nThe $8.6M increase in controls from FY20 to FY21 includes increased procurement funds for battery shipsets based on current and projected fleet needs, adjustments to annual production-engineering costs at the ISEA, recapitalization efforts at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) battery shop, and sustainment of Battery Monitoring Systems (including ABMS tech refresh).\n\nThis program procures and installs initial and replacement Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries for all classes of submarines (LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, OHIO SSBN\/SSGNs and VIRGINIA). This program funds, manages and supports the VRLA In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) at NSWC Crane. The efforts of the ISEA are directly tied to maintaining readiness of the batteries in the fleet and testing, verification and validation of design and procedural changes to ensure battery performance meets operational needs. ISEA assessments and production engineering efforts support determinations of battery End-Of-Life (EOL) and allow proactive scheduling of battery replacements to minimize operational availability impacts (Ao) for the fleet. \n\nBattery operation and capacity is critical to ship safety and reactor safety. Without acceptable battery capacity submarines cannot deploy, which reduces the submarine force at a time when strategic requirements, force protection and intelligence gathering capabilities are in high demand by combatant commanders.\n\nBatteries have a finite life and are consumables; this budget procures replacement VRLA batteries throughout the submarine service life on a notional 4 to 5 year replacement cycle.\n\nBeginning in FY19, program requirements were increased to provide funding for three specific production-engineering efforts needed to maintain, improve and sustain critical support infrastructure and materiel readiness of batteries and related components to operational submarines. These three specific production-engineering efforts are funded via HM830 and are the three 3 year efforts (FY19 - FY21) of recapitalization at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) battery shop, installation of Submarine Battery Evaluation Center (SUBBEC) at the ISEA and ABMS tech refresh.  \n\nBattery Installation Test Equipment\/Fixtures: Recapitalization effort at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) to maintain battery shop capabilities in support of VRLA efforts. The capability and capacity of the PSNSY battery shop to support the VRLA program has proven vital to meeting fleet needs. In FY19, the Navy would have seen serious schedule impacts for multiple hulls if the PSNSY battery shop had not been available among the VRLA resources. These battery shop capabilities need recapitalization to help carry them forward in support of future VRLA needs, especially as PSNSY serves as the conduit for batteries bound for every class of ship in Bangor, San Diego, Pearl Harbor and Guam. The recapitalization effort addresses battery shop building infrastructure requirements and procures battery charging and test equipment to support the testing, balancing, and charging of submarine batteries at PSNSY. This effort replaces the current PSNSY Battery Shop 1,500 Amperes (AMP) Motor Generator with a 5,000 AMP solid-state battery charger and other improvements required to conduct pre-installation battery testing and troubleshooting prior to installation on submarines. \n\nSubmarine Battery Evaluation Center (SUBBEC): Improvement effort at ISEA procures needed equipment and test stands for a full battery test station at NSWC Crane to aid ISEA efforts to conduct performance testing of a full submarine battery (250+ cells). Full string testing is vitally needed to help solve the battery life issues currently experienced in the fleet. The proposed system would allow 24\/7 unmanned testing and evaluation within the existing submarine battery test activity at NSWC Crane. Current capability must be constantly manned and monitored and only allows for testing of a small quantity of cells.  This does not provide a completely accurate representation of submarine battery operating profile or battery reaction to changes in profiles, due to inherent imbalance in the strings of cells, as installed on a submarine.\n\nAutomated Battery Monitoring System (ABMS) Tech Refresh: The battery monitoring equipment sustainment effort to validate and field upgrades and replacements for legacy ABMS\/BCMS units aboard operational submarines. For LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF and OHIO SSBN\/SSGNs this will be in the form of an ABMS tech refresh and long term sustainment support for ABMS\/BCMS units. The currently fielded 2002 ABMS\/BCMS system is suffering from continued obsolescence issues that are directly affecting fleet operations. NSWC Crane Power and Energy Division has managed legacy sustainment efforts but parts availability and maintainability have become barriers to continued support of the legacy system. Procurement of tech refresh assets is crucial for the future supportability and maintainability of the ABMS\/BCMS legacy assets aboard LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF and OHIO SSBN\/SSGNs.  Implementation of a BMS ShipAlt for VIRGINIA class assets will be vital for the projected future reliability and maintainability needs of the fleet.\n\nHM002 LOS ANGELES SSN, HM008 OHIO Class SSBN\/SSGN, HM009 SEAWOLF Class SSN, and HM010 VIRGINIA Class SSN: Procures replacement low maintenance sealed VRLA batteries for all submarines. This replaces flooded battery technology for which the industrial base ceased manufacture and support of in 2005. Replacement batteries that can be delivered in shipping\/installation trays speeds change-out during short availability and refit periods and reduces the rigging and handling evolutions needed per cell. Battery replacement funds are provided based on a reduced 4 to 5 year planned replacement cycle. Shipping\/installation trays are identified as discrete one-time buys based on funding availability and logistics needs. \n\nHM830 Production Engineering: Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane, as the designated procurement activity and In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) monitors battery performance and schedules replacements with the fleet. NSWC Crane is tasked with leading a Government & Industry Root Cause Analysis (RCA) team to identify and address battery performance issues and provide corrective actions to operational submarines. NSWC Crane conducts qualification testing of delivered VRLA batteries and analysis of poor performing VRLA cells returned from operational submarines, proven very beneficial to the Navy in detecting battery deficiencies before installation thus alleviating critical emergent fleet impact and assisting in identifying failure modes to improve long term performance. Funding provided to Puget Sound and Portsmouth Naval Shipyards includes responsibilities for the VRLA and flooded battery inventory management, maintenance and storage, SHIPALT support, and Alteration Installation Team (AIT) management. Also, Planning Yard and Lead Yard Services are funded through this line. ***Starting in FY19 Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) and FY20 Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) Battery Teams originally funded from within the battery installation costs (HM5IN) are funded in this line (HM830). This will enable the battery warehouse, battery shops and the subject matter experts to complete critical diagnostics, balancing, boosting, cabinets, shipping crates, testing and reporting, etc. ***"

            "val": "The increase in controls from FY20 to FY21 includes procurement funds for battery shipsets based on current and projected fleet needs. Number of batteries needed per class of ship changed and battery shipset costs vary by class type. \n\nThe increase in controls from FY20 to FY21 also funds the required adjustments to annual production-engineering costs at the ISEA, recapitalization efforts at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) battery shop, installation of Submarine Battery Evaluation Center (SUBBEC) at the ISEA and sustainment of Battery Monitoring Systems (including ABMS tech refresh).\n\nBeginning in FY19 - FY21, program requirements were increased to provide funding for overdue realized and required adjustments to annual production-engineering costs at the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) and for three specific production-engineering efforts needed to maintain, improve and sustain critical VRLA support infrastructure and materiel readiness of batteries and related components to operational submarines. These three specific production-engineering efforts are funded via HM830 and are the three 3 year efforts (FY19 - FY21) of recapitalization at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNSY) battery shop, installation of Submarine Battery Evaluation Center (SUBBEC) at the ISEA and ABMS tech refresh.  \n\nOverdue realized and required adjustments to annual production-engineering costs: The increased annual production-engineering (HM830 Production Engineering) starting in FY19 and maintained through the FYDP provided for procurement of necessary quantities of VRLA batteries to meet operational fleet needs based on current End-Of-Life (EOL) realizations and estimations. New VRLA IDIQ contract awarded in FY18 allowed re-baselining of unit costs to lower the cost per VRLA battery. Individual battery lines in HM002, HM008, HM009 and HM010 now reflect costs related to the individual battery only. Trays are on a separate line. This was coupled with realized EOL values below estimated (decreased from 5 years to 4 years for some batteries), which increased the quantity of batteries needed per FY to maintain fleet readiness. Dedicated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) efforts were expanded with intrusive and proactive monitoring and management of batteries installed in the fleet to minimize the impact to submarine Operational Availability (Ao). The additional RCA efforts and fleet interactions yielded valuable insights and targeted areas of improvement with regard to controlling manufacturing variability and applying procedural changes. The operational tempo for maintaining fleet readiness and re-baselining of unit costs highlighted that the ISEA had been underfunded and undermanned in previous FYs. The increased annual production-engineering (HM830 Production Engineering) starting in FY19 and maintained through the FYDP provided for addressing the required funding level for currently executed ISEA operations at the appropriate manning level. \n\nThree specific production-engineering efforts needed to maintain, improve and sustain critical VRLA support infrastructure: Starting in FY19 and going through FY21, a series of critical 3-year projects for the Submarine VRLA Battery program that includes the Battery Installation Test Equipment\/Fixtures, the Submarine Battery Evaluation Center and the Automated Battery Monitoring System Tech Refresh. Details on these projects are included in the description above."

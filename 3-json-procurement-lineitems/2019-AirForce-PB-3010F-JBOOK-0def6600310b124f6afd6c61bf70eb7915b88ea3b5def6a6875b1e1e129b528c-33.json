The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 ft.) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity compared with legacy C-130Hs and the C-130J (short).  \n\nOther variants of the USAF C-130J fleet are short-bodied aircraft and include the EC-130J (airborne psychological operations), WC-130J (weather reconnaissance), HC-130J (combat search and rescue), MC-130J (special operations), and the AC-130J (close air support and armed reconnaissance).\n\n\nProgram funding includes Diminishing Manufacturing Sources.\n\n\nTraining systems are required for both initial qualification and continued proficiency and the funding for this exhibit is contained in the Air Mobility Training PE 0401879F."

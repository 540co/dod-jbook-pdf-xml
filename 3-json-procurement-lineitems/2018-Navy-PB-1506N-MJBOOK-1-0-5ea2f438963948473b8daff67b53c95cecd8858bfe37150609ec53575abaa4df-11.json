            "val": "This line item funds modifications to a group of trainer aircraft systems which includes the T-44 and TH-57.  \n\nThe T-44 is a twin-engine, multi-seat turboprop aircraft produced by Hawker Beech Aircraft and is utilized to provide training for simulated operation of multi-engine training.  Specifically, this aircraft provides pipeline training for the P-3, P-8, EP-3, KC-130, E-6, E-2, C-2, and MV-22.  FY 2017 inventory is 54 aircraft with service life thru 2025 with possible multiyear extensions.  \n\nThe overall goal of modifications for T-44 is to modify and\/or upgrade aircraft avionics and associated sub-systems to include upgrades to avionic systems for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance.  Efforts also include, Avionics modifications to address safety, reliability, maintainability, obsolescence, and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) requirements.  Modifications, particularly to avionic systems, may also be driven by new Cyber Security requirements.   \n\nThe TH-57 is a single engine, multi-seat rotary wing aircraft utilized to provide rotary wing training.  FY 2017 inventory is 126 aircraft with no documented service life remaining.  The airframe and dynamic components can be sustained indefinitely (although at higher costs as time goes on).\n\nThe overall goal of modifications for TH-57 is implement safety updates as well as required upgrades to avionic systems for FAA compliance.  Efforts also include, modifications to airframe, avionics, and sub-systems, necessary to address safety, reliability, maintainability, obsolescence, and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) requirements.  Modifications, particularly to avionic systems, may also be driven by new Cyber Security requirements."

This submission incorporates corresponding schedule updates throughout the Future Years Defense Program modification efforts with a focus on maintaining ADS-B(Out) procurement and installation schedules to meet 1 January 2020 Federal Aviation Administration compliance deadline for ADS-B(Out)."

            "val": "This budget line implements the Army's plan to synchronize the reset and upgrade to common configurations of the Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected (MRAP) fleet returning from theater for Army enduring requirements, as well as produce\/procure materiel solutions to evolving threats in response to urgent warfighter requirements. These vehicles were originally procured in response to Operational Needs Statements, Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements, and Universal Urgent Needs Statements to meet wartime requirements to mitigate the effects of Improvised Explosive Devices, underbody mines, rocket propelled grenades, and small arms threats. The Army reduced the MRAP enduring requirement from 8,585 vehicles to 8,222 vehicles in Feb 2016.  All other MRAP variants will be divested.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY18 OCO of $17.508 million will complete the configuration standardization  of the MRAP enduring variants MATV, MaxxPro DASH Independent Suspension System (ISS), and MaxxPro Long Wheel Base Ambulances, and fund total package fielding to units. These efforts will baseline the MATV fleet to the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 22 configuration and baseline the MaxxPro Dash fleet to the LRIP 21 configuration plus MaxxPro survivability enhancements. Configuration standardization activities will include, but are not limited to: 1) Safety, 2) Survivability, 3) Capability set network communication equipment\/integration, 4) MRAP Associated Items of Support Equipment (ASIOE)\/Components of End Items (COEI) (i.e., Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station\/CROWS, Vehicle Intercom System - 3\/VIC-3, Driver Vision Enhancement\/DVE, Blue Force Tracker\/BFT, Counter-Radio controlled improvised explosive device Electronic Warfare\/CREW, etc) and 5) Produce\/procure materiel solutions to evolving threats in response to urgent warfighter requests. These configuration standardization efforts will also consolidate variant types, reduce MRAP fleet sustainment costs and facilitate Type Classification and Full Materiel Release for MRAP enduring vehicles. This request complies with the Department's funding guidance for the MRAP OCO funding request to include costs to retrograde and repair vehicles to its original or standardized configurations. MATV and MaxxPro configuration standardization activities will be conducted at Red River Army Depot (RRAD), Leghorn Army Depot (LAD), MATV Key Leader Vehicle configurations will also be standardized at Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR).\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

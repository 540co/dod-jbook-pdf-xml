            "val": "FY2021 through FY2025 funding levels support procurement of Submarine Rescue Chambers (SRC) material and planned upgrades to Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS). \n\nFY2022 increase includes the procurement of a shallow water transfer skirt, including long lead forging, and other assistive equipment for pressurized submarine rescue. Pressurized shallow water mating is a critical capability gap. The US submarine rescue system currently mates to US and Foreign submarines through an articulating transfer skirt. Current capability only covers 60 percent of the world's rescuable waters. Funding provides for forging and procurement of a new Transfer Skirt and assistive equipment to allow for shallower submarine mating capability and improve the ability to rescue submariners from a Distressed Submarine (DISSUB).\n\nThe Submarine Escape and Rescue Program, formerly Deep Submergence Systems Program (DSSP), is responsible for the procurement, life cycle support, improvement and modernization of assigned platforms and programs.  The Submarine Escape and Rescue Program provides for the procurement of equipment to support the establishment and maintenance of fleet capability for a number of programs which perform submarine search and rescue, inspection, and object location and retrieval from the ocean environment.  Submarine Escape and Rescue procurements replace obsolete, non-supportable equipment and subsystems through phased improvement and modernization projects.  These projects may include special ship alterations, field change kits, and design corrections.\n\nSOURCES:  The sources for these acquisitions are limited.  There are few private companies actively engaged in deep ocean engineering and even fewer with the specialized certifications, experience, knowledge, and facilities to meet the exacting requirement of the Submarine Escape and Rescue Program.  Accordingly, sole source contracts are sometimes required; however, where possible, contracting via open competition is utilized.\n\n[P40A \/ HJ030 - RESCUE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: INTERVENTION SYSTEMS (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE (ROV)\/SRDRS\/SUBMARINE RESCUE CHAMBER (SRC) Intervention assets (ROV) are required to support the SRDRS and SRC world-wide rescue capability mission.  Intervention assets are used to clear disabled submarines seating surfaces, attach the SRC downhaul cable, attach salvage fittings, deliver emergency life support stores, and assess disabled submarines.  The ROV is an unmanned system that reduces operational risk from the previous Intervention Assets that were a manned system, ATMOSPHERIC DIVING SYSTEM (ADS); full transition from ADS to ROV is pending availability of funding for a second ROV.  SRC provides shallow water un-pressurized rescue capability.  SRDRS is the deep water rescue ready system for the U.S. Navy.  SRDRS was delivered in increments; the Submarine Rescue System-Rescue Capable System (SRS-RCS) completed OPEVAL in FY08, and the final component of SRDRS was the Transfer Under Pressure (TUP) or Submarine Rescue System-Submarine Decompression System (SRS-SDS) which completed Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in FY2019."

FY21 funding is required to complete planned upgrades and obsolescence to the SRDRS."

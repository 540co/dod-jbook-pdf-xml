The Raptor is the USAF's top priority for ensuring air dominance in support of Joint Forces' operational access and homeland defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is the first operational multi-mission fighter that combines stealth, super cruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the most capable anti-access, area denial combat aircraft.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0207138F."

            "val": "The F-22 funding procures the following requirements, but is not limited to those listed below:\n\nF-22 Mission Critical Replenishment Spares (MCRS) commensurate with the service life of the F-22 and increases in the fleet's annual flying hour program.  Spares include leading edge flaps, wings, wing tips,  horizontal stabilizers, main weapons bay doors, and other large surface area components to support expedient repairs from aircraft mishaps or condemnation identified during the fleet-wide reversion repair.  The majority of these spares are long-lead items with a diminishing manufacturing base.\n\nFunding also supports the procurement of test stations, necessary to test and troubleshoot aircraft components as well as procurement of support equipment required to enable on\/off aircraft maintenance. \n\nFunding may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, respond to field support equipment issues, and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other mandates to ensure continued aircrew safety maintenance capability and mission effectiveness."

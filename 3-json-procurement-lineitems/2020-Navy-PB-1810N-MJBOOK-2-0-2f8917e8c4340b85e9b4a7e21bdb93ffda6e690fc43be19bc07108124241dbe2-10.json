            "val": "This Budget Line Item funds The Unmanned Carrier Aviation (UCA) Mission Control System (UMCS) program. This program builds, integrates, installs, and sustains control systems required to operate the MQ-25 and other ship installation associated with MQ-25.\n\nUMCS consists of the Mission Control Station (MCS), the Video Management System (VidMS), ARC-210 the Radio Communication System (RCS), and the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Radio Communication System (MRCS).  The MCS has a ship and shore variant designated the MD-5A and MD-5B, respectively.  The MD-5 consists of the following susbsystems:  Common Display System (CDS), Common Processing System (CPS), Network Processing Group (NPG) which includes a redundant Network Attached Storage (NAS), and the Integrated Communication System (ICS), along with the Stingray Operating Software Suite (SOSS).  MD-5A and B use the same common components with slight differences in the ICS, SOSS, and networking and transmission systems. The MD-5B requires an Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) Shore system and dedicated Command Data Link (CDL) terminals.  The VidMS provides MQ-25 operators the required video situational awareness of the unmanned carrier environment.  The ARC-210 RCS provides narrow band Line of Sight (LOS) command and control (C2) transmissions with the MQ-25A while the MRCS provides narrow band Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) C2 transmissions with the MQ-25A using the MUOS satellite system. UMCS government personnel are performing the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) role across all the hardware and software systems within UMCS which includes assembly, integration, system checkout and delivery.\n\nUMCS integrates with the MQ-25A air system, local networks, voice networks, C2 networks, tactical networks, intelligence systems, and launch and recovery systems. The government also performs the LSI role between the control systems listed in the aforementioned paragraph and the externally managed systems required for MQ-25 operations. \n\nUMCS will install aboard all NIMITZ class carriers (with the exception of CVN 68), all delivered and planned FORD class carriers, and the operational shore sites.  All installation and some integration activities aboard NIMITZ and FORD class carriers are planned and executed using the Ship Change Document (SCD) process. These installation and integration activities are conducted serially across up to three carriers availability periods for each carrier where each availability period is preceded by three years of labor and material procurement in accordance with the NAVSEA SCD process. Normally, each availability is executed in four phases. Phase 1 begins with the SCD planning and technical data preparation three years prior to availability. Phase 2 starts with material procurement of hardware two years prior to availability. Phase 3 starts with installation final design one year prior to availability and finally Phase 4 is installation during the availability period.  Installation and integration activities at the operational shore site are planned and executed via a method similar to the SCD process tailored to shore facilities.\n\nThe MD-5 control station production effort includes production planning (methodology), non-recurring engineering (NRE) for one MD-5 control station, quality plan and procedures, and the movement of the production line into a dedicated, government owned facility for systems storage, integration and checkout in order to provide sufficient capacity for future production demands."

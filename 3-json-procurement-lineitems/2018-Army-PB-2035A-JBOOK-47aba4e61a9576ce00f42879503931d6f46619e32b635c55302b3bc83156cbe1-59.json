            "val": "The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) supports Combatant Command (COCOM)\/Army Service Component Command (ASCC) based on emerging rapid equipment requirements.  The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF). \n\nThe REF is the Army\u2019s Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and non-standard equipment solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.   The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.\n\nThe REF bridges the gap between the Army\u2019s traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase U.S. Army Force readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the COCOMs\/ASCCs in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.\n\nThe Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the needs of Soldiers serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army \/Acquisition Logistics\/Technology (ASA (ALT) visibility, oversight, and direction."

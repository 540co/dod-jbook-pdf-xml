            "val": "The Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) acquires small launch services to deliver affordable, flexible spacelift for small payloads.  The small launch program complements the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program with multiple options to acquire dedicated spacelift and rideshare services for developmental, demonstration, and small operational space vehicles.  The Spacelift Capability Production Document approved 31 May 2016 supports the requirement for small spacelift capability (0-8,000 lbs to low Earth through geostationary transfer orbit). \n\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Air Force is establishing this procurement line to satisfy the small launch procurement requirements.  Previously, small launch funding resided in the satellite program budgets.  This change aligns launch service procurement activities with the necessary funding under SMC's Launch Enterprise.  This approach is now consistent across Air Force procured launch services and allows the Air Force the flexibility to manage dynamic manifest requirements as new launch service providers emerge.\n\nThe current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to \"fight through.\" \n\nThis program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares.  Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix of vehicles in the program.  RSLP procures launch services and is not a weapon system.  The program provides launch capacity for the Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements, but does not take ownership of any specific launch vehicle.  The requirements for small launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1206860F."

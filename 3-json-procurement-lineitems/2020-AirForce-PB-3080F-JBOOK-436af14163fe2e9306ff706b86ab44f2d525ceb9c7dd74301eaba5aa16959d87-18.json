            "val": "CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)\n\nThe CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN\/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN\/TSC-147, AN\/TRC-213\/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN\/TPS-75 Radar, CRC's organic radar. Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Roadmap provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037.Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues. \n\nIn order to meet warfighter requirements, incremental updates are required. In the FY19 PB, these efforts were categorized as Phase 2 capabilities to include, but not limited to: Procurement of radio kits for the AN\/TRC-213\/214 RRSVS radios, and procurement of a Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) tracker to be incorporated into the CRC. In FY20 and out, these efforts will be broken out into separate thrusts and IML names and will no longer be referred to as Phase 2. The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $11.852 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. Due to program execution, program funding in FY20 has been deferred and previously planned efforts will now begin in FY21. \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207412F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

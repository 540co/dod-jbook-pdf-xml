            "val": "The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate time, three-dimensional position, and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. GPS satisfies validated joint service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid navigation for military aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and personnel. The system is comprised of three segments: (1) satellites, (2) a ground control, and (3) user equipment. The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The ground control network updates the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to provide system vectors to target location or navigational way points. Funds in this line support various GPS specific production efforts associated with the ground control and user equipment segments. \n\nKEY DATA LOADING INSTALLATION FACILITY (KLIF)\/GPS SECURITY DEVICE: The KLIF facilitates the programming of black key (cryptographic) algorithms into the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to provide accurate positioning solutions for GPS users using secure equipment. \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 1203164F NAVSTAR GPS (User Equipment)(Space)."

Funding will procure support for Key Data Processors (KDP), ensuring uninterrupted support to SAASM vendors. SAASM vendors are required to use government-provided KDP as part of the security architecture of GPS User Equipment.\n\nContinue program office and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, etc."

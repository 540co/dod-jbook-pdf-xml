            "val": "The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24\/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counter-fire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket\/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets\/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.\n\nIn FY2017, the Army decided to extend the operational life of the HIMARS fleet until FY2050 or beyond.  This decision to increase the fleet\u2019s life by >20yrs drives numerous obsolescence mitigation, technology refresh, and future recapitalization activities of the launcher fleet.\n\nArmy Acquisition Objective is 363 HIMARS launchers."

HIMARS Mods address obsolescence mitigation and other design modifications via design, production, and implementation of Modification Kits to the HIMARS fleet.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

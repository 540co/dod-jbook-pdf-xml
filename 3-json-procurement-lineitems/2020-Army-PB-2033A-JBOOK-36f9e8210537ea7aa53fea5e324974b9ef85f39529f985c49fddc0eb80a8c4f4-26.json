        "Description": {
            "val": "The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (LW155), also known as the M777A2, is a Joint Service program between the US Marine Corps (USMC) and US Army which provides direct, reinforcing, general support fires to maneuver forces and direct support artillery. The LW155 was first introduced into the USMC in April 2005 and the Marines have fielded the howitzer to all active units. The Army fielded the howitzer to its Stryker Brigade Combat teams (SBCT), Fires Brigades and National Guard. Fielding of the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) commenced in FY2014 and will continue through FY2018. The LW155 saw extensive action in Afghanistan, receiving high marks for its performance. It replaces all howitzers in all USMC missions and replaces the M198 howitzer as the general support artillery for light forces in the Army. The LW155 fires unassisted projectiles to a range of 30 kilometers (km) and assisted projectiles to 40km. The addition of the digital fire control system enables the weapon to program and fire the improved Excalibur precision-guided munitions to ranges in excess of 40km with better than 10-meter Circular Error Probable (CEP) accuracy. The LW155 is the first ground combat system whose major structures are made of high strength titanium alloy and the system makes extensive use of hydraulics to operate the breech, load tray, recoil and wheel arms. The combination of titanium structures and the use of hydraulic systems resulted in a significant weight savings of 7000 pounds over the M198 system. Compared to the M198, the LW155 emplaces three-times faster and displaces four-times faster. It traverses 32-percent more terrain worldwide and is 70-percent more survivable than the M198. It is a successful joint service program between the USMC and US Army working together to develop, produce, field, and sustain the howitzer."

It is used to procure hardware, materials, and hardware installation cost required to complete the modification. Modifications are performed to correct safety deficiencies, increase mission capabilities, extend the useful life, improve supportability, upgrade existing technology, increase efficiency, improve readiness and to meet new legal and regulatory requirements. By modifying existing equipment, the Army maintains a ready, supportable inventory of equipment that meets current requirements and regulations at a cost considerably below that of buying new equipment."

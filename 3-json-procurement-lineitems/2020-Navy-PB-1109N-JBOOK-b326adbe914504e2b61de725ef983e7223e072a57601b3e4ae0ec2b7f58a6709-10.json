            "val": "The M41A7 Saber weapon system is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor precision assault capability for USMC Infantry, Tank, and Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalions across modern operational environments. The M41A7 is the replacement for the M220 Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire\/Wireless-guided (TOW) 2 weapon system.  GPS-based location detection and an altitude determination subsystem generate a 10-digit grid coordinate of a target's position, and superior surveillance capability enables the warfighter to identify targets at long range and  engage with TOW missiles or other weapon systems.\n\nTOW missiles (BGM-71 Series) are the munition for the M41A7 system. The TOW missile is a highly lethal, cost effective, interoperable, multi-purpose anti-armor round that is used in either direct-fire or \"fly-over, shoot down\" mode against field fortifications and structures.  In its current configuration, the combination of the M41A7 and the TOW missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. \n\nThe M41A7 is mounted from a variety of combat vehicle systems such as the Joint Lightweight Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP), and Light Armored Vehicle - Anti-Tank (LAV-AT), as well as having the capability for ground mounted operations.\n\nOrganic Precision Strike (Medium) will meet the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) requirement for a lethal precision capability by procuring the Spike NLOS (Non Line of Sight) system to support current combat operations.\n\nSpike NLOS is a multi-purpose, electro-optical (EO), Man-in-the-loop (MITL) missile system with a real-time wireless data link for ranges up to 32 km (minimum range of 1 km).  It's manufactured by the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and is being delivered to US Special Forces via Lockheed Martin in partnership with Rafael. Spike NLOS is in operational use by USSOCOM, Spain, United Kingdom, South Korea, and Columbia. Spike NLOS or a like capability is a solid candidate to replace our aging Saber\/TOW systems and modernize our infantry to meet the requirements identified in the Marine Corps Operating Concept.  The Spike NLOS launcher and High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) and Penetrator Blast Fragmentation (PBF) missiles match or exceed the capabilities of the Saber\/TOW systems in range and effects.  Such precision fires organic to the infantry would enable small units to achieve greater effects, shorten the kill chain at the tactical edge, counter threats within and outside complex and compartmentalized terrain, and harness the capabilities of our organic UAS.  Capability \/ Shortfall: MARSOFs require the ability to strike stationary and mobile point targets in real time out to the limits of their ability to positively ID targets with organic ground and airborne ISR (AISR) assets while minimizing collateral damage. Potential target sets include personnel in the open or under light cover, light frame or single layer brick buildings, and unarmored or lightly armored vehicles (moving and stationary), to include vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) or high value targets (HVT) moving at speeds up to 45mph."

The unit price per missile is influenced by the demand in production quantities per year through foreign military sales and combined service purchases. The estimated missile unit prices for FY19 and FY20 are based on a Government Estimate for procurement of the TOW 2A Practice missile variant. The increase in unit price is due to an Engineering Change Proposal cut-in for TOW obsolescence mitigation and safety program, as well as inflation.\n\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $60.501M ($60.309M Active; $0.192M Reserve)\n$33.712M will procure 500 missiles (the maximum amount as the current government estimate) as well as recurring missile surcharge to support both missile expenditures and training requirements. $4.839M will also be used for engineering and program management efforts associated with the refurbishing and retrofitting of missiles in order to extend their service life and will also support product improvement upgrades for the Saber System, engineering, logistics, program office support, and reserve equipment support. The unit price per missile is influenced by the demand in production quantities per year through foreign military sales and combined service purchases. The estimated missile unit prices for FY19 and FY20 are based on a Government Estimate for procurement of the TOW 2A Practice missile variant. The increase in unit price is due to an Engineering Change Proposal cut-in for TOW obsolescence mitigation and safety program, as well as inflation.\n\nFY19 to FY20 indicates a funding increase of $9.269M due to a Spike NLOS (Non Line of Sight) requirement for $21.950M being added to the program in FY20. The actual available funding in FY20 for the TOW missile program is $38.551M, which is a decrease of $12.681M from FY19 funding and results in 197 fewer missiles based on the current unit cost for FY20 missile procurement.\n\nThe $21.950M procures Spike NLOS for Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), with future capability for expansion to additional systems. The estimated project cost of one MARSOC Spike NLOS System is $7.317M per system, which includes the missile launch\/guidance system, an associated vehicle or adaptation of an existing vehicle, an inventory of 10 missiles, initial training\/logistics support.  This will buy 3 systems.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO): $4.460M\nFunding in the amount of $4.251M covers replenishment of 83 TOW missiles in combat operations in theater as well as training specific ammunition for units in direct support of operations. Funding also provides for engineering, logistics, and program management support required to place TOW missiles in service."

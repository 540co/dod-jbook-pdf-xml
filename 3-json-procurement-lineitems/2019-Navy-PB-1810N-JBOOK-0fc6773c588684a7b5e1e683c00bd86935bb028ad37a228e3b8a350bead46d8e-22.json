            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is the acquisition approach and contract vehicle used to manage the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) enterprise network which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy (DoN). Additionally NGEN provides security for the non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  NIPRNET is a private IP network used to exchange unclassified information, including information subject to controls on distribution, among the private network's users.  SIPRNET is a system of interconnected computer networks used to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the \"completely secure environment.\"  NGEN forms the foundation for the DoN's future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense-provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services.  \n\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature became the Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS in FY18, realigning funding from 8161 ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY to 8164 NEXT GENERATION ENTERPRISE SERVICE\n \n.  NMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract. This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model.\n\nMILCON Project P-013 - MILCON Project P-013 provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams in Hawaii Wahiawa, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards.\n\nMILCON P-913 project combines the cyber defense missions from two buildings (M-51 and NH-95) into one 187,000 square foot integrated communications facility with SCIF capability at Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMSLANT).\n\n[P5 \/ CONUS -Technical Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP)]: CONUS Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP):  TRMP is a requirement performed by Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) which focuses on upgrading the existing Hardware and or Software to mitigate End of Life, End of Support and End of Software Support issues in order to maintain network performance, Architecture\/Solution Accreditations and network security.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H\/W and\/or S\/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. Cloud Migration and Productivity Services) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.\n\n[P5 \/ OCONUS ONE-NET Transition]: NMCI OCONUS funding will provide for the technical refresh of antiquated server farms that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network, along with antiquated PCs which will be at the end of their warranty.  It will also provide the funding for systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into the NGEN business model.  This will result in a fully integrated navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach.\n\n[P5 \/ OCONUS ONE-NET Tecnical Refresh]: ONE-NET FY19 funding will provide for the technical refresh of antiquated server farms that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network, along with antiquated PCs which will be at the end of their warranty.  It will also provide the funding for systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NGEN business model.\n\n[P5 \/ OCONUS Piers Technical Refresh]: Additionally FY19 funding will be used to upgrade existing End of Life (EOL) infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, etc.) for global Navy PIERS locations which will allow for the transition of the OCONUS Enterprise Pier Connectivity Architecture (EPCA) into a single global network.\n\n[P5 \/ Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS)]: The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations.  JRSS will replace the existing Navy cyber protection boundaries allowing for a common and operable cyber defense network across all of the DoD."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "CONUS TRMP Costs +$9.7M:\nThe net growth of +$9.7M from FY18 to FY19 for the Technical Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) consists of the following:  An increase of +$10.8M in support of Cable Plant outside plant\/inside plant (OSP\/ISP) and required facility infrastructure equipment replacement to prepare the NMCI infrastructure for access to Cloud and web enabled enterprise solutions.  This capability does not currently exist on the NMCI network.  The slight decrease of -$1.1M is the result of a refinement of TRMP requirements currently on the network.      \n\nOCONUS Costs -$21.3M consist of the following:\n  - ONE-Net Transition (-$14.1M): The decrease of -$14.1M is a result of the transition of ONE-Net from the Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model to the NGEN Government Owned\/ Contractor Operated (GO\/CO) model upon the NGEN-R contract award.    \n  - ONE-Net Technical Refresh (-$1.7M):  The decrease of -$1.7M from FY18 to FY19 is a result of the transition of ONE-NET from the Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model to the NGEN Government Owned\/ Contractor Operated (GO\/CO) model. Therefore, less OPN funding is required to maintain existing hardware until full transition of OCONUS seats to NGEN-R contract.  \n  - Piers Technical Refresh (-$5.4M):  The decrease of -$5.4M is due to 3-year refresh, which was completed in FY18.  Therefore, minimal OPN funding is required to upgrade existing hardware until full transition of OCONUS seats to NGEN-R contract.          \n\nJoint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) (-$0.7M):  The decrease of -$0.7M for the Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a result of a Departmental decision to realign funding to DISA to pay for the Navy's fair share of the Department of Defense (DoD) JRSS must pay bill.  The funding supports planning, engineering, and movement of Navy Networks behind the JRSS through firewall functionality, intrusion detection and prevention, enterprise management, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), and other network security capabilities.  \n\nNCTAMS LANT C4I costs +$3.4M:\nThe growth of +$3.4M supports MILCON Project P-913 - Shore Based Enterprise Network Enhancements: This funding supports the procurement and installation of NMCI infrastructure to the new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMSLANT) Facility (MILCON P-913).  \n\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature became the Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS in FY18, realigning funding from 8161 ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY to 8164 NEXT GENERATION ENTERPRISE SERVICE\nThe Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII), will be called the Navy\/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS.  \n\nNMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy Pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract.  This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model in conjunction with the current Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) network.  In essence, the CONUS and OCONUS networks are intended to merge into a single allocated baseline as part of the NGEN Re-compete contract.  \n\nNMCI OCONUS funding will provide for the technical refresh of antiquated server farms that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network, along with antiquated PCs which will be at the end of their warranty.  It will also provide the funding for systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NEN.  This will result in a fully integrated navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach.  Additionally FY19 funding will be used to upgrade existing End of Life (EOL) infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, etc.) for global Navy PIERS locations which will allow for the transition of the OCONUS Enterprise Pier Connectivity Architecture (EPCA) into a single global network.\n\nTechnology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) involves the modernization and periodic replacement of NMCI hardware\/software and assigned non-IT assets identified in the NGEN TRMP plan required to support network performance.  The objective of TRMP is to improve and maintain network performance, increase network capacity based on project demand, improve security posture from vulnerabilities and integrate DoD and\/or DoN mandates.  NGEN assets are Government Owned\/Contractor Operated (GO\/CO).  A significant  amount of those assets have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported by the vendors, which makes our infrastructure vulnerable to external cyber-attacks; and diminishes enterprise solutions performance and optimization.  Our current infrastructure is aged and modernization is essential to improve storage capabilities to accommodate new emerging workforce requirements; maintain network performance, architecture\/solution accreditations, and network security.  The procurement of these assets will continue in FY18 and beyond.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H\/W and\/or S\/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS and ORT) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.Hence, future TRMP funding will be utilized to transition to 10GB networks.  The final phase of ORT cybersecurity enhancements were procured in FY16 for deployment in FY17.  Therefore, beginning in FY18, previously deployed ORT components that become obsolete will be refreshed as part of TRMP to maintain the security posture of the network, which will become part of the baseline for the follow-on NGEN contract.  New and advanced cyber security efforts, not included in the NGEN Re-compete baseline, will leverage Cyber Resiliency funding.  \n\nThe Joint Information Environment (JIE) scope which included JRSS was laid out broadly in a series of Joint Chiefs of Staff Tank and Deputy Secretary Management Action Group (DMAG) decisions in 2012.  DoD CIO, via the JIE EXCOM, has further refined the priorities of those tasks, consistent with the implementation strategy.  JRSS is DoD's near term modernization priority, and is fielded as an Enterprise Service, as designated by the DoD CIO in November 2015.  With the designation of JRSS as an Enterprise Service, the DoD CIO required JRSS be separately identified within the DoD FY17 President's IT Budget submission.\n\nThe funding supports the planning, engineering and movement of Navy Networks behind the Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) through firewall functionality, intrusion detection and prevention, enterprise management, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), and other network security capabilities. This OSD JRSS initiative comprises several critical Joint Information Environment capabilities including network modernization, initial implementation of a single security architecture, joint management of DoD IT security, and improvements to cyber-security situational awareness.  JRSS transforms the network security, aligning the DoD Components to a common capability, which significantly improves DoD mission effectiveness through situational awareness visibility for all echelons within DoD.\n\nMILCON Project P-013 - Navy Information Operations Command, Hawaii (NIOC HI) performs all duties assigned by Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT), Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) \/ Commander Tenth Fleet (COMTENTHFLT), Navy Information Forces (NIF), and the Director, National Security Agency. NIOC HI conducts and provides support to information warfare, cyber, signals intelligence, Information Operations (IO) and electronic warfare mission areas in the Pacific Fleet area of responsibility (PAC AOR). At the direction of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), FLTCYBERCOM \/ COMTENTHFLT will be deploying substantial Cyber Mission Forces to Oahu. NCTAMS PAC and NIOC HI require close collaboration and alignment between the elements of the intelligence community under NIOC HI and the network operations under NCTAMS PAC in a controlled environment. MILCON Project P-013 provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards."

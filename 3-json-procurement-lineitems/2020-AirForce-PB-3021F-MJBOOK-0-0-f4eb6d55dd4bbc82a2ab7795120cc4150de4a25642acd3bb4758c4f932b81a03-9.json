            "val": "PE 1203179F Integrated Broadcast Service\nThe IBS is a multi-sensor, multi-source, system of systems for the dissemination of integrated threat warning blue force tracking information. IBS provides intelligence producers and information sources the means to analyze and disseminate strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence and threat warning information directly to the warfighter. The IBS operational baseline represents the migration, integration, and consolidation of existing tactical data dissemination into a future common architecture message format. The IBS future common architecture is enabled by using enterprise level experimentation for future on-orbit solutions for primary and alternate over-the-air communication pathways. \n\nIn FY20 PE1203179F 3021F: Space Procurement, Air Force\/BSA 1: Space Programs IBS000\/INTEG BROADCAST SERV moved to PE 0305179F Integrated Broadcast Service Procurement Other Procurement\/ BA 03: Electronics and Telecommunications Equip\/BSA 2: Intelligence Programs P-1 Line Item: 832070 Intelligence Comm Equipment BP83.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

            "val": "PE 1203179F Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) - P40A\nFY19 funding for IBS procurement efforts are focused in the following areas:\n\n1. CIB UPLINK SITE (CUS) TACTICAL INFORMATION PROCESSOR AND ONLINE FUSION FACILITY (TIPOFF): TIPOFF serves as the control system for the CIB Uplink Site and interface to the IBS Network Services (IBS-NS). Each major release of the software incorporates approved requirements as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability requirements, and system security. The new release supports migration to CIB Uplink Sites.\n\n2. COMMON INTERACTIVE BROADCAST PLANNING TOOL (CIB-PT): The CIB-PT provides the COCOM Planners an integrated software\/hardware mechanism to allocate space-based communications resources to theater and national producers, specifically to reliably optimize the timeliness of scarce bandwidth allocation of extremely time-critical messages. Each major release of the software\/hardware incorporates updated producer prioritization, bandwidth allocation, mission monitoring and interfaces to the STRATCOM systems as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security compliance to achieve threshold requirements. \n\n3. COMMON MESSAGE FORMATE PARSER LIBRARY (CMFPL): The CMF repository is required for the automatic exchange of data among processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) systems. This effort procures the infrastructure for dynamic software library updates for multiple operating systems essential to broadcast operation.\n\n4. IBS V&V Environment: Procures simulation and stimulation tools to certify and verify mission equipment for operational use. Included is the MULTI-AREA REMOTE SIMULATOR (MARS) a component of the IBS verification and validation process used to emulate multiple systems messaging under operational conditions and the UNIVERSAL CIB TEST SET (UCTS) a component that emulates the UHF SATCOM environment.\n\n5. TERMINAL, DATALINK, & ENTERPRISE SERVER MITIGATION: Funds direct mission support activities such as verification & validation documentation; uplink receive and transmit terminal upgrade, enhancements and spares; mitigation; CMF product support; JOINT TACTICAL DATA LINK, i.e., Link 16 support; product documentation; studies and analyses; IBS Web Support and contractor system engineering activities.\n\n6. IBS-NS\/IBS-X: Scaling capability is required for messaging under operational use. Funds approved modernization of Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and Theater Interface Nodes (TINS), technology refreshment and integration as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security. Utilizes the existing IBS-X for resiliency as a third GINS and additional CUS for operational testing and modernization."

            "val": "The MK-19 Mod 3 is a self-powered, air-cooled, 40mm automatic grenade machine gun capable of a firing rate of 325-375 rounds per minute. It is used to engage point targets up to 1,500 meters and provide suppressive fire at ranges up to 2,200 meters. Since the initial fielding of the MK-19, various system enhancements have been identified that further improve the system by increasing operational capabilities and improving reliability, readiness, maintainability, and safety. The MK-19 is fielded with the MK93 mount and during static defensive operations it is ground employed utilizing the M3 or M205 Tripod Mount. An on-going system improvement to the MK19 is application of improved mechanical sights thru a Modification Work Order.  The improved sight reduces the MK19 logistic burden by reducing the number of parts as well as increasing Soldier capability thru updated ballistic solutions. The Mounted Machine Gun Optic (MMO) provides the Soldier increased accuracy and identification at range by equipping the Medium\/Heavy Machine Gun including the MK19 MOD 3 GMG an optic with selectable magnification. The MMO also retains the capability of short range, transition fire. MK93 Improvement Kits will enhance hit performance during on the move engagement by dampening mount movement. MK93 Improvement Kits also help when firing extreme elevation and integration of new optics and fire control due to better stability.  The Programmer Unit (PU) provides the means for fuze setting for the 40mm airbursting capability currently under development."

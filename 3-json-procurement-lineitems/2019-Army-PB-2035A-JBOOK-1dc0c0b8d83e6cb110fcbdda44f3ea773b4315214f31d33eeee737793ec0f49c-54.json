It provides a rapidly deployable, multi-level security, processor-to-processor, high capacity communications capability, and supports tactical to strategic reach-back, essential to split-based operations.\n\nDINGO is a critical component to supporting the ability to produce, maintain, and update geospatial imagery to support wartime missions, including Weapons of Mass Destruction - Elimination (WMD-E) and Non-Combatant Evacuation (NEO). It supports split based operations during crisis, contingency and wartime operations.  The system processes Electro Optical (EO), Infrared (IR) and RADAR imagery. It also performs 3D modeling and is capable of processing Full Motion Video (FMV)."

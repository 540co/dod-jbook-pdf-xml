        "Description": {
            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is a Department of the Navy (DON) enterprise program (ACAT IAC) which provides secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel. NGEN forms the foundation for the DON's future Naval Networking Environment (NNE), is interoperable with and leverages other DOD provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services and supports the Joint Information Environment (JIE). For the Marine Corps, NGEN is a Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model augmented by NGEN contractors with the garrison Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) representing the NGEN Marine Corps management domain. NGEN (USMC) supports the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) using a regionalized model, executed through Marine Forces Cyberspace Command, Marine Corps Cyberspace Operations Group (formerly Marine Corps Network Operations and Support Center (MCNOSC) and MAGTF IT Support Centers (MITSCs).  The NGEN (USMC) program provides contractor support for the operation and support of the MCEN Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (MCEN-N) to include multiple contracts that provide equipment refresh.   The program also supports hardware\/software license and warranty generating lifecycle services ultimately enabling Cyber\/Information Technology (CYBER\/IT) capabilities for the Marine Corps in accordance with the NGEN Acquisition Strategy. This capabilities include enterprise infrastructure, end-user workstations, service desk, and network operations centers at Marine Corps base\/post\/stations and regional installation commands CONUS and OCONUS (Hawaii, Japan, Germany, and Korea).  \n\nNGEN will deliver an end-to-end hosting solution to consolidate and replace End-Of-Life (EOL) hardware\/software (HW\/SW) and infrastructure that currently provides enterprise network services (email, file storage, security services, identity management, etc.) to MCEN-N users (CONUS and OCONUS).  It also provides High Availability\/Disaster Recovery (HA\/DR) capabilities that are not currently available in support of USMC Continuity of Operations (COOP) requirements. The requirement also includes the delivery of a Wide Area Network (WAN) transport solution based upon the JIE and Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) construct to consolidate and replace EOL HW\/SW that currently provides enterprise network WAN transport services to MCEN-N users.  As the consolidated, upgraded solution is developed, the program will continue to tech refresh end user devices, servers, routers, switches, network storage, software, initial equipment warranties, and defensive cyberspace capabilities (intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, etc.).  The hardware and software for this refresh differs in quantities and costs based on varying requirements including the current pricing.  The quantities that are ordered are based on hardware\/software end of service\/life limitations and the operational balance between security and risk management. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, functional testing, and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities in conjunction with newer technology insertion to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement.\n\nNACCR is an Abbreviated Acquisition Program (AAP) modification to the NGEN and SONIC Programs of Record (PORs) supporting the network access control concept on the MCEN. The NACCR end state solution provides an integrated capability allowing only authorized and compliant assets connection to the garrison enterprise network.  This solution utilize 802.1X and Active Directory authentication protocols, as well as a series of compliance checks to ensure that critical software patches, anti-virus\/anti-malware definitions and other established compliance criteria are current for assets on the network.  It also generates trouble tickets as required and reports compliance standards. Any asset found to be non-compliant with the established criteria will be forced into a partially isolated network segment, where required remediation corrective actions will be taken. Should the automated remediation efforts prove unsuccessful after the prescribed number of attempts, the asset will be forced into a completely isolated network segment until it can be manually brought into compliance."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY18 Baseline Appropriation Request: $97.014M funding procured services, hardware and software supporting end user devices, network infrastructure technical refresh, and procurement of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) equipment.  Tech refresh supported the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, and the Marine Corps' implementation of the Joint Information Environment (JIE), which includes NIPR Installation Processing Nodes (IPN) critical design and site configuration.  Tech Refresh included the design, configuration, and functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities.  This was in conjunction with the insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. The DPRI Guam ($32K) NGEN requirement in FY18 supported MCEN-N access requirements for Marine Corps Activity Guam (MCAG) personnel needing computer assets.  \n\nCost Elements in FY 2018 were updated to reflect actuals in PB20 because they were unable to be updated during the PB19.  The FY 2018 End User Device quantities decreased from 23,500 to 9,750.  The decrease was due to receiving an influx of funding from the FY 2017 ATR which provided for the procurement of additional End User Devices required to support the mandated WIN 10 transition.  The remaining funds were realigned to address the reprioritization of efforts from Cost Elements 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 to Cost Element 1.1.3 for the upgrade\/modernization of end of life\/end of service equipment. If the equipment was not replaced, then it would have been removed from the network which would have caused network disruptions. This reprioritization aligns with the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy, transforming and optimizing the non-Classified Marine Corps Enterprise Network and directly supports DoD's Comply To Connect (C2C) initiative through network modernization. In addition, unit costs for End User Devices fluctuate from year to year due to changes in the quantities procured.  \n\nFY 2019 Baseline Appropriation Request: $82.120M ensures the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the MCEN against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.  Funding procures services, hardware and software supporting end user devices, and network infrastructure technical refresh.  Tech refresh supports the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, and the Marine Corps' implementation of the Joint Information Environment (JIE) which includes Enterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) critical design and site configuration. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, and functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities.  This is in conjunction with the insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. In addition, FY 2019 efforts include the continuation of WLAN implementation which will increase the operational readiness of operating forces and decrease maintenance time by allowing the maintainers to connect to technical manuals and maintenance systems while they are working. Currently maintainers must leave their work and go to a kiosk where there is a wired connection.\n\nCost Elements in FY 2019 were updated to reflect actuals. The $14.894M decrease in funding was primarily due to the reduction in EUDs purchased as a lingering effect from the greater number additional EUDs purchased to support that transition.  The purchase reduction also required less field support funding.  Changes when compared to PB 2019 were caused by the realignment of Marine Corps resources in order to implement and conform with the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy.  \n\nFY 2020 Baseline Appropriation Request: $114.901M will ensure the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the MCEN against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.  Overall, FY 2020 funding increased $30.044M from FY 2019 which reflects the Marine Corps decision to align resources to Next Generation Enterprise Network Enhancement in order to replace aging and end-of-life network infrastructure which will increase the Marine Corps' Enterprise Network's reliability and security posture in order to defend the network against cyberattacks from both Nation-States and third party actors.  The baseline appropriations request also includes $78K which is needed to procure End User Devices in support of MCB Guam personnel.  \n\nEnd User Device (Cost Element 1.1.1) funding increased from $5.001M in FY 2019 to $15.998M in FY 2020, a $10.997M increase, due to the refresh\/replacement of End User Devices (EUDs) which will enable users to remain connected to the network with a fully compliant EUD. Replacing the aging EUDs will reduce the amount of equipment which is no longer receiving software patches or updates to operating systems which resolves cybersecurity vulnerabilities. If these EUDs are not replaced, then there will be an increased cyber security risk to the Marine Corps network which will lead to users being unable to connect to the network and perform their required duties as their non-compliant EUDs are removed from the network. Unit costs increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 is due to inflation. \n\nFielding Support (Cost Element 1.1.2) funding increased from $0.763M in FY 2019 to $2.288M in FY 2020, a $1.525M increase due to increasing the quantity of EUDs purchased for refresh in FY 2020, 9,552 laptops.  This cost element is directly related to changes in cost elements 1.1.1 and 1.1.3.\n\nNetwork Equipment Tech Refresh (Cost Element 1.1.3) funding increased from $21.257M in FY 2019 to $60.262M in FY 2020, a $39.005M increase, due to reprioritizing efforts from Cost Elements 1.1.1 and 1.1.2  to Cost Element 1.1.3 for the upgrade\/modernization of end of life\/end of service equipment.  This reprioritization aligns with the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy which focuses on transforming and optimizing the non-Classified side of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network and directly supports DoD's Comply To Connect (C2C) initiative through network modernization.  Upgrades include the procurement of 802.1X access switches enabling the Network Access Control portion of the C2C requirement found in Section 1653 of the FY 2017 NDAA.  Additionally, the equipment procured under this cost element will be replacing equipment that is no longer receiving security patches or updates from the vendor and is therefore more vulnerable to hostile actors and other cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a cybersecurity precaution and this will lead to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  The increase will enable the Marine Corps to replace the aging network devices with current cybersecurity standard compliant devices which will enable users across the Marine Corps to continue to operate without network disruptions.  \n\nEnterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) (Cost Element 1.1.4) funding increased from $30.199M in FY 2019 to $30.353M in FY 2020, a $0.154M increase, due to inflation.  Funding under this cost element provides for the upgrading and modernizing the Enterprise Service Stacks (ESS), Installation Processing Nodes (IPN), Installation Service Node (ISN) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) across the non-Classified side of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network.  These modernizations will support the Marine Corps' ability to migrate to the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the cloud by increasing bandwidth which will enable individual and organizational mobility and supports the rapid deployment of mission critical applications and services.  In addition, the migration to the cloud will result in reducing long network engineering\/provision lead times.\n\nWireless Local Area Network (WLAN) (Cost Element 1.1.5) funding decreased from $24.000M in FY 2019 to $6.000M in FY 2020, an $18.000M decrease, due to the ramping down of initial procurement of WLAN capabilities to the maintenance bays and stations.  Funding in this cost element provides for the completion of the WLAN project at the initial maintenance bays and hangars installations.  This effort will enable maintainers to access updated technical manual messages and updated maintenance information\/alerts.  The implementation of WLAN at maintenance bays and hangars, resulted in a 25% increase to the number of Ready Basic Aircraft due to efficiencies generated from WLAN. \n\nNetwork Access Control Compliance and Remediation (Cost Element 1.2.1) funding decreased from $0.900M in FY 2019 to $0.000M in FY 2020, a $0.900M decrease due to the completion of initial fielding of the discovery tool identifying the physical devices on the network."

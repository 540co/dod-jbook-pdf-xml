            "val": "This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of Aircraft and Aircraft components.  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.417 million support the following: At Redstone Test Center (RTC), procures new data acquisition equipment used to collect vital airspeed data. The new airspeed calibration and measurement system uses advanced laser partial Doppler shift technology to make non-intrusive air data measurements with improved accuracy and repeatability to support testing on any rotary or fixed wing aircraft. At Yuma Test Center (YTC), replace and upgrade production-based support aircraft instrumentation hardware for the time-stamping of on-board recording and telemetry. Replacements and upgrades for production-based support aircraft instrumentation and equipment will support YTC mission by providing reliable telemetry data along with relevant environmental data and time-stamps. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data are collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

This includes capital type rehabilitation (MPC 3000) projects for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment, property appraisals and energy conservation; and environmental compliance (MPC 7000) efforts to ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials. Air Force Plant 44 is the backbone of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems assembly and maintenance supporting AMRAAM, Javelin, Griffin, Phalanx, Sidewinder, Standard Missiles, Stinger, Tomahawk, and numerous other weapon systems. Funds are provided within this appropriation to assess space-related industrial base concerns (MPC 6000).\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F"

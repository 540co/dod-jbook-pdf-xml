            "val": "Force Provider is a fully integrated system providing critical basic life support for Soldiers deployed in remote areas. A Force Provider module provides billeting, field feeding and hygiene capabilities that include all the integrated utilities to include climate control, power generation, water and waste water systems, and fuel storage. A typical Force Provider module is capable of sustaining 150 personnel. Force Provider is fully containerized for rapid deployment and is transportable by rail, sea, land, and air using C-130, C-17 or C-5A aircraft. With the addition of Cold Weather Kits (CWKs), the module is deployable in temperatures as low as -15 degrees Fahrenheit. Missions for Force Provider are: Base camps for enforcement missions, peace keeping, theater reception\/redeployment, intermediate staging base operations, humanitarian aid and disaster relief (both in theater and in austere environments). Force Provider modules are placed in Prepositioned Stocks to meet critical Operational Plan requirements of the Army Service Component Commands (ASCC). Each Force Provider module is configured in 150-Soldier or 50\/75-Soldier expeditionary subsets that are capable of operating independently as mission requirements dictate. These systems are configured with optional Resource and Energy Efficiency Kits, Power Generation Kits, Cold Weather Kits and Prime Power Kits which increase their deployment versatility. The Army Acquisition Objective for Force Provider is 226 each 150-Soldier modules and 20 each 50\/75 Soldier modules. Twenty four of the 150-Soldier Modules will be equipped with energy-efficient Rigid-Walled Shelters in lieu of the standard soft-walled shelters."

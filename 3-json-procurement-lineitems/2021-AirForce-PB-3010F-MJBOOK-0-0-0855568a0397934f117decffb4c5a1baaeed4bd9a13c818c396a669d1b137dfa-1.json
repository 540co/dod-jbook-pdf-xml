            "val": "Note: This program was transferred to F015EX\/F-15EX starting in FY21 for transparency.\n\nThe expected minimum procurement quantity for F-15EX is 144 aircraft (a combination of 2 in RDTE (PE27134F); 6 in F015E0 (Line #3); and 136 in F015EX (Line #4).  F-15EX is currently a Middle Tier Acquisition program, not a Major Defense Acquisition Program.  Once the program transitions to a Major Defense Acquisition Program and the Acquisition Program Baseline is approved, the total program quantity for F-15EX will be established.  All numbers are based on the Air Force Cost Analysis Agency's initial Non-Advocate Cost Assessment and will be refined for major milestones and on an annual basis.\n\nThe F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C\/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structures risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time-consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C\/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. F-15EX logistics, maintenance, and training will heavily leverage the existing F-15 infrastructure.\n\nFunding may be used to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and\/or obsolescence issues. DMSMS activities may include, but are not limited to, bridge buys, life of type buys, buys to protect production schedule, and minor engineering efforts."

The MK-41 VLS significantly improves missile capacity, flexibility, multi-mission capability, reaction time, rate of fire, and is designed to be adaptable to present and future weapon systems.  Current configurations are: two 61 cell launchers (forward and aft) for 22 TICONDEROGA (CG 47) Class Cruisers beginning with CG-52, one 61 cell aft and one 29 cell launcher forward for 28 ARLEIGH BURKE (DDG 51) Class Destroyers, one 64 cell launcher aft and one 32 cell launcher forward for 34 DDG 51 FLT IIA ships.\n\n[P5 \/ CANISTER EQUIPMENT]: Funds procurement and installation of canister and gas management hardware Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTs)."

Availability of upgraded canisters, canister hardware, and gas management hardware directly impacts fleet loadouts, operational availability, and safety."

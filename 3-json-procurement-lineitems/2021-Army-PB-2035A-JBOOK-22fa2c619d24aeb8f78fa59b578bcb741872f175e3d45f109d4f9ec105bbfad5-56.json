The CALSETS instrumentation provides support to maintenance units and area support organizations from brigade to multi-theater sustainment operations and ensures a cascading transfer of precision accuracy originating from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The calibration sets are designed to support 90 percent of the Army test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) workload with an objective of 98 percent.  The instruments and equipment procured through this program are assembled into several set configurations (AN\/GSM-286, AN\/GSM-287, AN\/GSM-439, AN\/GSM-440, AN\/GSM-442, AN\/GSM-26(V)1, AN\/GSM-26(V)2 and Secondary Reference) and two tactical calibration shelters (AN\/GSM-705 and AN\/GSM-421A(V)2).  These calibration standards sets are integral to verifying the accuracy of TMDE with mandated traceability to accuracy standards.  State-of-the-art calibration equipment is required to ensure that advanced technology weapons and systems are maintained at the required state of operational readiness.  Systems supported by the Calibration Sets include, but are not limited to, unmanned aerial vehicles (Shadow\/Gray Eagle); military signal and electronic intelligence operations; tactical and strategic communications (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)); and ground, missile and aviation platforms such as the Army Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), Abrams, Multiple Launch Rocket System, Patriot, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook and all future weapon systems.\n\nArmy Acquisition Objective (AAO):  AN\/GSM-286 - 45; AN\/GSM-287 - 67; AN\/GSM-439 - 38; AN\/GSM-440 - 33; AN\/GSM-705 - 27; AN\/GSM-421A(V)2 - 27; AN\/GSM-26(V)1 - 162; AN\/GSM-26(V)2 - 34; AN\/GSM-422 - 1; Secondary Reference Standards Set - 11"

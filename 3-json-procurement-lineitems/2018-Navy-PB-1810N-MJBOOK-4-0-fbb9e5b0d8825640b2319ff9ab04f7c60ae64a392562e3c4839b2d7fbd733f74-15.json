            "val": "TRAINING SUPPORT EQUIPMENT - Main driver of increase from FY17 to FY18 reflects procuring more items for the NCTE infrastructure, which has seen significant growth as the program has expanded to meet the Fleet's integrated Fleet Training Wholeness demands and to maintain systems cyber security. \n\n1.1  LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT (NCTE) Funding will support Enterprise Network refresh. The Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) is a distributed training architecture and network that interconnects 111 Navy, Joint and Coalition training sites. To maximize return on the training dollar, reduce overall operating expense, and support the global live, virtual, and constructive nature of the NCTE, the suite of equipment must be continuously maintained, upgraded and keep pace with mandated DISA and DoD cyber information assurance requirements.  Planned periodic replacement of hardware is essential to keep pace with technology upgrades, allow DoD mandated virtualization of the NCTE infrastructure.  Virtualizing hardware systems reduces hardware requirements by consolidating hundreds of individual physical machines onto a much smaller number of virtualization server machines. This reduces Life Cycle Maintenance hardware costs, as well as space and cooling costs.  Virtualization also improves resource availability by pooling computing resources and sharing them in response to real time demands. This means that instead of buying hundreds of computers that sit partially idle most of the time, the virtualization server is more efficiently utilized, reducing costs. The upgrades\/spare parts are vital to the Fleet's Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) training capability used by the U.S. Navy and Joint Services to prepare for deployment. Changes from FY17 to FY18 are: Increase of $2.499M is supporting planned hardware replacement of the NCTE infrastructure to ensure compliance with cyber security.  Additional sustainment costs are due to requirements for increased cross domain information sharing needed for Carrier Strike Group (CSG) integrated training.  NCTE Tier 1 hardware refresh\/replacement includes routers, switches, firewalls and computers; network time servers; desktop\/servers\/zero-clients to allow continued availability of services and comply with cyber security requirements including proxy firewalls and web proxies' requirements.\n\n1.3  BALLISTIC MISSLE DEFENSE (BMD) FLEET SYNTHETIC TRAINING (FST) at Sea : This capability will support BMD and Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) mission area Fleet sustainment training and mission rehearsal in theater, allow ships to participate in COCOM\/Navy Component Commander mandated BMD\/IAMD exercises while pierside or underway, as well as enhance BMD\/IAMD training objective accomplishment in current Fleet Readiness Training Plan (FRTP) underway training events such as COMPTUEX and JTFEX. Changes from FY17 to FY18 are: Increase of $0.010M supports increased number of BMD\/IAMD exercises and certification events conducted during FRTP and by Numbered Fleet Commanders for deployed forces.  The NCTE and FST directly support Fleet training readiness and strike group and BMD platform deployment certifications. The Fleet's LVC training capability funds the necessary equipment to support BMD FST at Sea training used by the U.S. Navy.\n\n1.4  ANTI-ACCEESS AREA DENIAL (A2AD): Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) Capability provide the NCTE architecture the systems required to incorporate specific technologies, C4ISR stimulation capabilities to train Fleet units in A2AD Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The Fleet's LVC training capability funds the necessary equipment to support A2AD training used by the U.S. Navy.  Changes from FY17 to FY18 are increase of $0.065M supports incorporation of expanded capabilities developed in partnership with the Office of Naval Research. These enhancements improve representations of advanced anti-ship missiles and non-kinetic effects.  Procures additional A2AD capability gateway portable embarkation kits to allow advanced Electronic Warfare training during Carrier Strike Group (CSG) Fleet training events\/exercises. \n\n1.7  NAVAL INTEGRATED FIRE CONTROL COUNTER AIR (NIFC-CA): Changes from FY17 to FY18 are: Increase of $0.267M establishes steady state production of systems supporting NIFC-CA training requirement, following initial prototyping efforts. The capabilities will supplement and integrate existing platform-level program of record solutions and is complementary to NAVAIR and NAVSEA efforts to deliver From the Sea (FTS) training capabilities. The Fleet's LVC training capability funds the necessary equipment to support NIFC-CA training used by the U.S. Navy. Procures additional Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Interim Training (CIT) System portable embarkation kits to support CSG Fleet training requirements.\n\n1.8  IMPASS SCORING SYSTEM : Changes in FY18 are: $2.200M required for the planned replacement of the Integrated Maritime Portable Acoustic Scoring & Simulation (IMPASS) Naval Gunfire Scoring System to comply with Surface Force Training Manual (SFTM) to attain Naval Gunfire Support certification. IMPASS was an Office of Naval Research (ONR) system fielded in 2003 to allow continued certification for Naval Gunfire Scoring. The system was fielded without any follow-on sustainment or modernization funding. The current IMPASS buoy scoring systems need critical systems modernization due to obsolesce of hardware and software. OPN is required for the replacement and modernization of five (5) IMPASS Buoy Systems to include portable scoring buoys, controller stations, spares, engineering support and oversight. Existing IMPASS systems are currently beyond their 10 year life expectancy, non-IA complaint and will attrite due to lack of hardware and unsupported software.  The Surface Force Training Manual (SFTM) mandates that the use of the IMPASS Naval Gunfire Scoring System as the only accredited means by which a deploying CG or DDG with five (5) inch guns can attain Naval Gunfire Support Certification in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Additionally this requirement applies to Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) units stationed in Rota.  The Atlantic coast lacks fixed land scoring systems to support mandated pre-deployment certification. Without certification, Commander Fifth and Sixth Fleet will not accept these ships and require them to certify on a NATO range. NATO ranges have restrictive use and availability as well as charge for their services. There are no guarantees that a NATO range will be available for a deploying unit to be able to attain required Naval Gunfire Certification.\n\n2.1  Fire Arms Training Simulator (FATS) Equipment: $0.474M required for procurement of shore-based fire arms training simulators at Center for Submarine Learning (CSL) to reduce time and energy expended for small arms proficiency by personnel assigned to small ships and submarines that lack this capability afloat as required by COMSUBLANT. These un-tethered weapons systems and scenarios place the students into the action and afford them the ability to freely maneuver and handle the weapons.  Procurement of these simulators in FY18 allow for repetitive training and learning of the movements without the cost of ammunition or the wear and tear on weapons and ranges.  \n\n3.1  FY18 procurements enable NETC to meet the DoD\/DoN requirements of consolidating footprint while ensuring optimized performance of the desktops and servers in support of the Sailor 2025 and Ready, Relevant Learning.

Additional increase of $1.038M in FY18 is required to accelerate planned addition of robust graphics processing capabilities which to VDI sites to support Ready, Relevant Learning requirements. \n\n4.1 Multi-purpose Reconfigurable Training System (MRTS):  $5.400M required for the Center for Information Warfare Training (CIWT) to replace the obsolete Virtual Radio Room suite and capitalize on using a single hardware suite to simulate various pieces of Technical Training Equipment (TTE).  CIWT needs to upgrade training system to meet IT A-School and Journeyman Communications course (JCC) C-School training mission for 2000+ students annually. \n\nEducation Support Equipment\n\n1.2 Backup System Replacement ($0.400M in FY 2018) : Provides for IT hardware and software to replace obsolete tape library.  The proposed replacement system will facilitate faster and more reliable backup of enterprise data using current technologies.\n\n1.4 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ($0.318M in FY 2018): Provides lifecycle replacement of outdated electronic classroom workstations and operating systems by standardizing content delivery through central hosting to reduce operating costs and information assurance risks.   Replacement sustains current teaching and learning capabilities utilized on a daily basis by 4,500 midshipmen and 2,000 faculty and staff in meeting USNA academic and administrative requirements.\n\n1.5 Advanced Computing Cluster Replacement ($0.750M in FY 2018):  Provides a replacement high-end computer cluster for midshipmen and faculty computational requirements in science and technology disciplines.  Applications supported include flow visualization, computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamics.  The server also provides central file back-up, software and communication services for numerous laboratories, classrooms and courses.  The computer will replace a device for which incremental upgrades will no longer be feasible due to intervening technological advancements.  Sustainment of current services is essential to maintaining relevance of Naval Academy advanced academic computational research involving large or complex data sets.  The replacement annually benefits approximately 100 midshipmen, faculty and staff by providing state of the art computing capabilities.\n\n1.7 Articulated Hub & Rotor Blade Assembly ($0.800M in FY 2018): Provides for life-cycle upgrades to conduct rotary-wing aerodynamic and performance testing in support of the engineering curriculum and research related to fluid dynamics, vibrations, acoustics, structural dynamics, flight propulsion, helicopter performance and aerodynamics.  The equipment will replace existing assets acquired in the 1970s that are no longer viable.   Failure to sustain currency of the USNA aeronautical engineering program risks loss of accreditation and inability to meet Navy demand for officers with subspecialty education backgrounds in the aviation field.  This line item annually benefits midshipmen, faculty and staff, and enables USNA to provide 35% of midshipmen with practical, experimental, and theoretical applications\/experiences within aerospace and mechanical engineering and related mathematics and physics courses.  Without this tech refresh science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) majors would be at risk for accreditation\n\n1.13 Voice Switch Software Upgrades ($0.500M in FY 2018):   FY 2018 provides software updates and IP voice telephony to maintain technical equivalence and interoperability with evolving marketplace requirements.   Upgrades directly benefit 4,000 end-users reliant on voicemail services in meeting Naval Academy academic, professional, and athletic mission requirements.  This enables faculty, staff, and midshipmen to maintain communication regardless of their location.\n\n1.15 Coastal Engineering Tank Wave-maker Replacement ($0.450M in FY 2018):  Provides for end-of-life replacement of wave-maker acquired in FY 1978.  The existing wave-maker is unable to produce the quality of waves required for academic instruction and research.  The replacement wave-maker will reduce the need for unplanned emergency repairs which jeopardize ongoing operations.   Restoration of as-built capabilities is essential to maintaining relevance of Naval Academy near-shore educational programs annually benefitting approximately 250 midshipmen, faculty and staff.  Failure to restore system performance risks loss of accreditation and inability to meet Navy demand for officers with subspecialty education backgrounds in the Ocean Engineering field."

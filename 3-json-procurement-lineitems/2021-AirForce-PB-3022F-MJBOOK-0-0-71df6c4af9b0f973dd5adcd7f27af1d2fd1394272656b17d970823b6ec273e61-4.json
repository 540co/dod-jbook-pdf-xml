            "val": "In FY 2021, P-1 Line Item GNRLIT \/ General Information Technology efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nPE 1203173SF R&D Space and Missile Operations\n\nThe Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Innovation and Prototyping Directorate at Kirtland AFB (KAFB), NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in support of prototype, experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) and Mobile Range Facility (MRF) at KAFB and at Schriever AFB (SAFB), CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates, and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions and transitions designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs. Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n      \nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified \/classified  enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanism to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new, or repurpose capabilities.\n      \nPE 1203174SF Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development\n\nLocated at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program supports the AFSPC Space Analysis Center Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system. AVAC is a stand-alone system that provides a crosscutting capability to conduct, support, and report analysis on a myriad of tools, data, models and simulations. This system allows leadership to make decisions based on quantifiable operational impacts output from AVAC based on various vignettes and studies applied to space and cyber assets. Funding buys system-specific hardware, software, routers, licenses, etc., to maintain the efficiency and compatibility with all current models.\n      \n      DISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Distributed Communications Architecture.  This system provides a network-based communications capability enabling dispersed space personnel to participate in space exercises and wargames and to assist in development, testing, and validation of SIIRTD innovation projects supporting the Combat Air Forces.  It can also support limited command and control capabilities for space operations.\n      \n      SPACE ANALYSIS CENTER:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Air Force Space Command Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system.  The system provides classified modeling and simulation tools for the AFSPC Space Analysis Center to conduct operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Related modeling and simulation tool development is funded in RDT&E,SF, PE 1203174SF, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development."

            "val": "PE 1203173SF RDSMO\n\nPer FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program was renamed National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. In association with the NSSL name change direction, the Air Force has renamed the Long Duration Propulsive EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) (LDPE) program to be the ROOSTER program. Pre-existing LDPE-1, LDPE-2 and LDPE-3A mission names will remain unchanged.\n\nFY 2021 funds ($1.926M) will be used for critical recapitalization of RDSMO ground enterprise hardware to include: communication systems, telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) hardware, antenna systems, and common user equipment to support the transition and implementation of prototype\/experimental space missions at RSC and SAFB C2 environments. This recapitalization is essential to support continued integration and prototyping of missions including: ROOSTER (LDPE)-1 mission, the AFSPC-12 mission, the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) mission, the Tetra (1-3) and LDPE-2-3 follow-on prototyping missions.  The MMSOC C2 baseline will continue to be supported for legacy missions being operated at the RSC and SAFB. Funding will assist RDSMO to rapidly respond and implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to deliver and characterize experimental capabilities and transition operationally to the warfighter in the contested space domain.  Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, experimentation, prototyping, etc. \n      \nPE 1203174SF SIIRTD\n\nFY 2021 funding ($1.373M) modifies modeling and simulation tools that U.S. Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities. This effort will incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Space Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realized the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities."

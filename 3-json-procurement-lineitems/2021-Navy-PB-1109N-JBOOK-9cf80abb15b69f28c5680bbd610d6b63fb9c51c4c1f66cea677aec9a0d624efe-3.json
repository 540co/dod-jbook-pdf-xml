It is a joint program between the Marine Corps and Army, which is additionally supporting various foreign military purchases of the weapon system.  The LW155 was first fielded by the Marine Corps in April 2005 and completed fielding in April 2013.  The Army has fielded the system to its Stryker Brigades and Fires Brigades and completed fielding to its Infantry Brigades in September 2018.  The LW155 is being significantly utilized in the Middle East in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  This budget line supports system updates to maintain and increase performance and lethality.  M777A2 is the prominent weapon of the Marine indirect fires triad and currently the only cannon in the Service.  Modernization efforts to include extended range will keep the M777 relevant to the concept of operations (distributed units operating with increased dispersion) envisioned in the Marine Operating Concept."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2019: $24.858M ($24.852M Active; $0.006M Reserve)\n\nFY 2019 funding continued the installation of modification kits; such as the Improved Power Conditioning Control Module (I-PCCM), Mission Computer (MSC-R), and Chief of Section Display (CSD-R) ($.401M).  Additionally, funding supported the procurement of Chrome Cannon tubes ($3.710M) and Software Defined Radios, cables, and brackets ($20.747M).  Software Defined Radio modification enables more secure radio communication and facilitates new encryption protocol interoperability between artillery and supported forces.  The new radio will provide the ability to perform voice and data functions over the same radio which increases operational flexibility for firing units. The FY19 column of the FY20 request included additional funding for Internal Navigation Unit (INU) Recapitalization. However, the INU Recap funding was included in and approved as part of the Omnibus 2019 Reprogramming Request and, therefore, is no longer reflected on the exhibit.     \n\n\nFY 2020: $25.065M ($25.059M Active; $0.006M Reserve)\n\nFY 2020 funding provides for continued procurement of components such as the final lot of chrome cannon tubes (QTY 165) that will outfit the entire USMC howitzer fleet ($24.993M). Chrome cannon tubes increase safety, accuracy, and longevity of the howitzer by eliminating propellant residue inside the cannon tubes. Propellant residue causes spiral wear, which reduces the muzzle velocity of the howitzer, and fuze malfunctions of projectiles. Reduced muzzle velocity leads to projectiles impacting short of their intended targets. FY20 funding also continues other efforts such as supporting integration and installation of previously procured hardware modification kits ($0.072M). \n\n\nFY 2021 Base Appropriation Request: $0.059M ($0.053M Active; $0.006M Reserve)\n\nFY 2021 funding will support the retrofitting of previously procured hardware modifications such as software defined radios and chrome cannon tubes ($0.059M).  The chrome cannon tubes retrofits will address safety concerns while retrofitting of the software defined radio will facilitate new encryption protocols to provide continued communication between artillery and supported forces.    \n\nNet funding decrease of $25.006 from FY20 to FY21 reflects the completion of the procurement of chrome cannon tubes for the howitzer fleet."

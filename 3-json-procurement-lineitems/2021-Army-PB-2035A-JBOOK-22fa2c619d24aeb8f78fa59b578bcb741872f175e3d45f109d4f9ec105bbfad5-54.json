The AVCATT also supports the training of Non-Rated crew members in crew coordination, flight, aerial gunnery, hoist, and slingload related tasks via the Non-Rated Crewmember Manned Module (NCM3); which can be linked to AVCATT's UH-60, CH-47, and UH-72 cockpit configurations to support a unit's specific Mission Training Requirements.\n\nSupports the Synthetic Training Environment (STE), which is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units at the point of need within the entire range of Multi-Domain Battle tasks in support of Unified Land Operations in a complex operational environment. STE will be a synthetic environment (virtual, constructive, and gaming) utilizing common authoritative data and models that is cloud-enabled through the Army Enterprise Network, and is service-based through the Common Operating Environment."

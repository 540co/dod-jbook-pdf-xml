            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN): The contract vehicle used to manage the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) enterprise network and the OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net) which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy (DON). Additionally NGEN provides security for the non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  NIPRNET is a private IP network used to exchange unclassified information, including information subject to controls on distribution, among the private network's users. SIPRNET is a system of interconnected computer networks used to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the \"completely secure environment.\"  NGEN forms the foundation for the DON's future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense-provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services. \n\nThe new NGEN-R family of contracts is comprised of End-User Hardware Services (EUHW)and Service Management, Integration and Transport (SMIT). EUHW is projected to award in FY20 Q1 and SMIT is projected to award in FY20 Q2. These vehicles posture the Navy's enterprise networks to deliver IT services in manner that meet future Naval Networking goals and objectives. FY20 requirements were reprioritized in support of contract award and transition. Future requirements and pricing will be refined post award.     \n\nCompliance Based Technical Refresh: Focuses on upgrading the existing hardware and or software to mitigate end of life, end of support and end of software support issues in order to maintain network performance, architecture\/solution accreditations and network security.  Compliance-based tech refresh buys down previously incurred technical debt and accounts for the \"sustainment\" bridge required to ensure legacy infrastructure continues to pace the obsolescence-based cyber security threat until replaced by Network Transformation efforts. Compliance Based Technical Refresh involves the modernization and periodic replacement of NMCI hardware\/software and assigned non-IT assets required to support network performance.  The objective is to improve and maintain network performance, increase network capacity based on project demand, improve security posture from vulnerabilities, and integrate DoD and\/or DON mandates.  NGEN assets are Government Owned\/Contractor Operated (GO\/CO). A significant amount of those assets have reached end-of-life and are no longer supported by the vendors, which makes the infrastructure vulnerable to external cyber-attacks; and diminishes enterprise solutions performance and optimization. Our current infrastructure is aged and modernization is essential to improve storage capabilities to accommodate new emerging workforce requirements, maintain network performance, architecture\/solution accreditations, and network security.  \n\nTransformation: The transformation of Navy Enterprise Networks is a key enabler for near and long-term mission effectiveness. Provides for the security and technology improvement efforts, to include systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of network infrastructure, in support of the future merging of the ONE-Net and NGEN operating models after award of the NGEN follow-on contract (NGEN-R).  ONE-Net convergence includes the migration of the network, processes, services, tools, and GO\/GO functions to the GO\/CO NGEN-R operational state in accordance with Service Level Requirements (SLR) and supporting Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) between service providers.  Full convergence is anticipated to take between 4-6 years and will result in a fully integrated Navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach as ONE-Net and NMCI business and operating models are merged and infrastructure solutions are aligned.  \n  \nJoint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS): Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations. Funding has been realigned from LI 8164 to LI 8645 (Cyberspace Activities) to functionally transfer funds to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) during the year of execution.\n\n\nCollateral Equipment - MILCON Project P-013 (BSO 60): Provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams in Hawaii Wahiawa, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards.\n\n[P5 \/ P013 MILCON]: Funds provided for the design, installation, and equipment purchase, associated with the development and refurbishment of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities. This will ensure information sharing is executed in a controlled environment and at the appropriate classification levels for the Cyber Mission Forces Teams."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2021 Increase of $61.611M is due to the following:\n\nNGEN-R Transition (+$16.0M): The total projected minimum NGEN-R Service, Management, Integration and Transport (SMIT) transition cost to the new NGEN-R SMIT provider is $90M ($37M in FY20, $53M in FY21).  NGEN-R SMIT transition is planned for nine months beginning in FY20 and ending in FY21.  The SMIT Transition effort encompasses the Phase-In and Phase-Out of 38 NGEN core services and 26 key management processes that are critical to day-to-day execution of CONUS and OCONUS Network Operations and Service Delivery.  The transition entails the procurement and build-out of critical infrastructure for:  1) establishment of a government laboratory; 2) refresh of Service Operations tools; and 3) Service Desk stand-up. \n\nCONUS Compliance Based Technical Refresh (+$1.593M): The FY 2021 increase of $1.593M supports Compliance Based Technical Refresh which buys down previously incurred technical debt and accounts for the \"sustainment\" bridge required to ensure legacy infrastructure continues to pace the obsolescence-based cyber security threat until replaced by Network Transformation efforts.  More specifically, FY21 funding will provide SIPR TACLANES upgrades, Database Security Gateways and Privilege Access Management, as well as network monitoring tool procurement and installation. \n\nCONUS Transformation (+$33.51M): The increase of $33.51M in FY 2021 funding will provide for storage infrastructure replacement to prevent against the loss of email archives (PST files), local data backups, solution storage, and shared drive services from equipment failure at end of life and end of service.  Additionally, HBSS will be End of Life in FY21 and the replacement is required to be compliant with the DoD cyber-security mandate. Keeping HBSS on the network increases vulnerabilities to cyber attacks on the network.  \n \nOCONUS Transformation (+$12.20M): The FY 2021 increase of $12.20M will provide for the security and technology improvements efforts, to include systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of network infrastructure, in support of the future integration of ONE-Net into the NGEN business model. OCONUS transformation will begin in FY21 and drive towards a fully integrated Navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach as ONE-Net goes through the process of transition to the NMCI business model from both an operating model (GoGo\/multivendor) and infrastructure perspective (aligning HW\/SW\/Capabilities to CONUS).  \n\nNCTAMS LANT C4I (-$1.0M): The FY 2021 decrease of $1.0M is due to the MILCON Project P-913 for completion of project - Shore Based Enterprise Network Enhancements.  This funding supports the procurement and installation of NMCI infrastructure to the new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMSLANT) Facility (MILCON P-913).\n\nJRSS: (-$0.008M): The FY 2021 decrease of $.008M is due to the realignment of funds from LI 8164 to LI 8645 (Cyberspace Activities) to be functionally transferred to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) during the year of execution.\n\n\nCollateral Equipment (BSO 60) - MILCON Project P-013 (-$0.684M): The decrease of $.684M from FY20-FY21 is due to the ramp down of design, installation, and equipment purchases in support of sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Facilities being completed. These funds ensure information sharing is executed in a controlled environment and at the appropriate classification levels for the Cyber Mission Forces Teams."

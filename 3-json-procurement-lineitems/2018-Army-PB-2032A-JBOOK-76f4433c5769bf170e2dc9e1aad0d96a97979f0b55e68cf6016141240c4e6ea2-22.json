It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, NM and Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, AL."

            "val": "ATEC:  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.189 million support the following:  At WSTC, provides lifecycle replacement of optical systems (high definition digital cameras, video recorders, video streamers, tracking and support cameras) to provide a reliable test capability for the collection of Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI) data as well as surveillance of all open air missile testing conducted at the test range.  At RTC, replaces obsolete and failing vertical shock machines used to perform missile shock tests by producing shock pulses within tolerances of MIL-STD-810; maintains the capability to evaluate hardware under anticipated shock environments in an efficient manner; also upgrades telemetry ground stations to reliably communicate with and track missiles in flight.  The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data are collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers."

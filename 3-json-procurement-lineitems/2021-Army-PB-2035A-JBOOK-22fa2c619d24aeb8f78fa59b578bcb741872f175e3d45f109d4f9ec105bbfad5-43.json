            "val": "The Construction Equipment (CE) Items less than $5.0M line supports various Programs of Record (POR) as well as ancillary equipment and attachments, where the acquisition cost for each line item is below $5.0 million. These programs provide the enhanced capabilities to the current force enabling them to execute their expeditionary mission to include:\n\n1. Route Remediation is mission that is supported by multiple programs that provides combat engineer units the capability to quickly repair damaged or lay new routes. Route Remediation PORs consists of:\n--Portable Asphalt Patcher (PAP) - The PAP enables the Engineer Asphalt Team with the capability necessary for rapid route remediation and preventing IED emplacement in potholes.  A highly mobile, self-contained, spray-injection asphalt patcher built on an M1077 flat rack, the PAP mixes aggregate with asphalt emulsion and dispenses the mixture into a repair area for a patch that is traffic ready within 20 minutes.  Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 7 systems.\n--Self-Propelled Concrete Saw (SPCS) - The SPCS enables Engineer Support Companies (Asphalt Teams, Concrete Sections, and Engineer Utilities Detachments) with the capability necessary to conduct rapid route remediation and rapid runway repair by quickly and effectively cutting out a damaged area of road or runway during the repair process and paving construction projects. The SPCS includes a heavy duty water supply hose with couplings capable of interfacing and operating with the Engineer Mission Module-Water Distributor (EMM-WD) to allow for cooling of the saw blade during use.  AAO is 65 systems.\n--Portable Concrete Mixer (PCM) is a 2 cubic yard capacity trailer mounted independently powered volumetric concrete mixer that supports the rapid route repair mission.  AAO is 268 systems.\n--Machine Powered Mowing System (MPMS) - An attachment mounted on the Heavy Type II Loader, the MPMS enables Horizontal Construction Platoons with the capability necessary to: (1) improve humanitarian conditions through the use of the ditching attachment to create improved water drainage paths and (2) clear routes and conduct improvised explosive device detection missions through the removal of ground cover, foliage, grass, weeds, and underbrush to prevent adversaries from placing improvised explosive devices near roadsides.  AAO is 66 systems.\n\n2. Water Well Drill System (WWDS) - The WWDS enables Well Drilling Teams within Army National Guard units with the capability necessary to drill and cast two complete water well holes up to 2000ft. deep.  The system enables the construction of new wells and repair of existing wells providing improved hygiene and sanitation for camps, facilities and local populations and providing the ability before, during and after combat operations to effect institutional and infrastructural improvements to strengthen selected urban subsystems identified as essential to the continued functioning of the urban system.  WWDS is capable of installing casings, screens, pump and developing wells to provide water at the well head.  WWDS can transport up to 2500 gallons of potable water and is capable of sustaining 24-hour operations.  AAO is 8 systems.\n\n3.  Family of Utility Service Equipment (FUSE) - The FUSE is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system that provides Prime Power units the ability to generate and distribute prime electrical power in support of the warfighter support operations.  System consists of four parts:  1) Aerial Lift Truck 2) Derrick Digger Truck 3) Pole\/Reel Trailer 4) Cable Trailer.  AAO is 25 systems."

            "val": "This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles and their components.  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that is technologically and\/or economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidance to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, NM and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. \n\nThis program provides funding to establish, modernize, expand or replace Army-owned industrial facilities and equipment used in production and production testing of Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles and their components.  The program also provides for the preserving, storing and disposing for facilities and equipment that are either not required for current active production or are not needed by the Army.  Provisioning of Industrial Facilities (PIF) occurs at Rock Island Arsenal, IL; Watervliet Arsenal, NY; and General Dynamics-Armaments and Technical Products, Saco, ME. The Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) and Maintenance of Laid-away Industrial Facilities (MLIF) funding supports unique and necessary equipment at Watervliet Arsenal, NY.  This program also provides funding for the Arsenal Support Program Initiative."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.284M support the following: At ATC, replaces and upgrades video cameras, video recorders, digital video tracking systems and telemetry systems used to assess fire control system performance.  At WSTC, provides badly needed upgrades to Directed Energy, High Power Electromagnetic Pulse and Lightning effects test simulators to provide a realistic threat environment to test survivability and vulnerability of combat systems. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic life.  This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data is collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized.  Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.  At YTC, provides funding for the Material Analysis Laboratory to upgrade analytical laboratory analyzers, laboratory equipment, computing equipment, and software.  This will permit the laboratory to retain the capabilities required to support testing of advanced tactical vehicles and weapon systems.\n\n\"In accordance with section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities\"."

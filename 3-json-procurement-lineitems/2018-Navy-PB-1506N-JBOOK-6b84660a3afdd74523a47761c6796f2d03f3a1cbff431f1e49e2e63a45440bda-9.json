            "val": "This line item funds modifications to P-3 aircraft.  The P-3 Orion is a four turbo-prop engine, long-range maritime surveillance aircraft which performs Under Sea Warfare, Surface Warfare and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance in support of battle group and littoral operations in direct support of Sea Shield and Forcenet pillars of Seapower 21.\n\nA key investment area is P-3 Mod Programs. Funding for these programs support a multitude of obsolescence, structural, sustainment, training\/logistics and warfighting capability upgrades that are key in keeping the P-3 platform relevant through Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) Initial Operational Capability. P-3 aircraft mods funded under the Aircraft Procurement, Navy line have heavily supported recent and current Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Without key technology upgrades and aggressive obsolescence management, P-3 aircraft will be unable to meet Fleet Response Plan requirements, leaving key Seapower 21 capabilities in support of the Combatant Commanders at risk. This P-3 Sustainment Bridge provides a roadmap ensuring sufficient P-3 assets for Fleet and Combatant Commanders to fulfill operational and training\/readiness requirements.\n\nThe overall goal of the modifications budgeted in FY2018 (as approved via 5 year rule waiver) is to continue aircraft sustainment, including USQ-78 improvements (part of Update III), comm\/nav\/surveillance weapon system improvements, upgrades\/modifications to airframe components\/systems (including outer wing replacements), safety improvements and key system obsolescence upgrades.\n\n[P3A \/ P-3 MISSION SYSTEMS( OSIP 006-08 )]: FY-18 P-3 obsolescence upgrades addresses obsolescence issues on 18 BMUP aircraft.  BMUP aircraft are supporting the Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) mission through 2023."

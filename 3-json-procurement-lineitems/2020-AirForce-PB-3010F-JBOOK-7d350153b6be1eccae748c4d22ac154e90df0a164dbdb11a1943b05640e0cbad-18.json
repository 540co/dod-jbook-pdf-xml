            "val": "Interim Contractor Support (ICS) provides maintenance and repair capability for depot-level repairs to meet Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) operational requirements for the B-2 weapon system. The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with legacy airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).\n\nThis exhibit covers ICS for new B-2 modifications. ICS for legacy components and WSSC funding is covered in Line Item 74.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

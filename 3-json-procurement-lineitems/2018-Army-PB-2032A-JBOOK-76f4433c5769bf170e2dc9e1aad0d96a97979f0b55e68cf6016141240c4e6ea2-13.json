            "val": "This modification effort will execute the inventory requirements established in the Total Army Munitions Requirement (TAMR) and will reset the 10 year rocket service life of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket system (GMLRS) rockets into either GMLRS Unitary or GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) configurations. It capitalizes on the 90% commonality between GMLRS Unitary and AW variants. The conversion process will include replacement of obsolete guidance sets, proper warhead configuration, and other critical components. \n\nGMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24\/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.\n\nThe GMLRS Program consists of three separate increments. GMLRS Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) was the first increment.  It is a cluster munition that replaced the shorter range MLRS rockets to engage area or imprecisely located targets.  GLMRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy.  GMLRS Unitary is the second increment that utilizes a 200 lb high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage.  The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant. GMLRS AW is a non-cluster munition developed to replace GMLRS DPICM.  The GMLRS AW program entered full rate production in FY15.\n\nThe U.S. Army manages all three increments as part of the GMLRS Program.  This modification program along with all GMLRS rockets are produced on a common production line by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas."

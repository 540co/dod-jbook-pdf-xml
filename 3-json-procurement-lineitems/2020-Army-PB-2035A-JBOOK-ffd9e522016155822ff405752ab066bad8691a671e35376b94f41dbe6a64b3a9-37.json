            "val": "Loader, Scoop, 2.5 Cubic Yard Type II is a commercial off-the-shelf loader with minor military modifications.  The Light Type II Loader is a general purpose scoop loader which is diesel engine driven, four wheel drive, with an articling frame steering. The loader is equipped with a multi-use four-in-one clam shell bucket and a forklift attachment. It also has the capability to accept a Crew Protection Kit in the form of a replaceable armor C-Kit cab for contingency operations.   The Light Type II Loader is fielded to Light Brigade Combat Teams, Concrete Teams, Engineer Support Companies, and the Army training base.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for Light Type II Loader is 286, with 35 Construction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVT).  The CEVT are commercial off the shelf virtual training devices with software modifications for military unique tasks.  These simulators enable the United States Army Engineer School with the capability to more effectively train Engineer Military Occupational Skill (MOS), while reducing maintenance of actual equipment and fuel costs during traditional training.  These simulators provide the Engineer Warfighter with a multitude of training scenarios and continuous hands on training on a variety of construction equipment and in various simulated conditions.  Use of CEVT increases skills and competency in the operation of equipment.\n\nLoader Scoop, 4.5 and 5.0 Cubic Yard Heavy Type I\/II are commercial off-the-shelf loaders with minor military modifications.  The Type I Loader is used for quarry operations and the Type II is used for general construction missions. Each is equipped with a quick couple system for use with a forklift and sweeper attachments. Both loaders are diesel engine driven, four wheel drive, with an articling frame steering. The Heavy Type I\/II Loaders have the capability to accept a Crew Protection Kit in the form of a replaceable armor C-Kit cab for contingency operations.  The Loaders are fielded to Horizontal Construction Companies, Asphalt and Quarry Teams, Equipment Support Teams, and the Army training base.  The AAO for Heavy Loaders is 241.\n\nThis program is considered a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations.\n\nIAW Section 1815 of the FY 2008 NDAA this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

            "val": "Remarks\/Justification:\n\nThe FY 2018 Joint Staff procurement appropriation requests $.903M for mission critical hardware\/software requirements for Commander's Exercise Engagement & Training Transformation (CE2T2).\n\nCombatant Commanders Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation (CE2T2): \nIncrease between FY 2017 and FY 2018 is due to CE2T2 transferring to the Joint Staff from the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) for direct execution and oversight of the program across the Services, Combatant Commands, and the Joint Staff.  Transferring the funding flow for the execution of CE2T2 through the Joint Staff is intended to focus improvement on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff focus areas consisting of the following: 1) Restoring joint readiness; 2) Improving our joint warfighting capability; and 3) Developing leaders for Joint Forces Next.\n\nThe CE2T2 program continues to strengthen, expand, and develop within the Joint Force warfighting capabilities and competencies. Specifically, it includes the following programs:\n\na.  Joint Deployment Training Center (JDTC): JDTC funding provides the equipment and infrastructure required to train Combatant Command\/Service\/Agency warfighters on Joint Deployment, Situational Awareness, and Global Force Management applications. The JDTC procurement is necessary to provide the assets (servers, workstations and software) required to train Combatant Command\/Service\/Agency warfighters and provide world-wide exercise support. The equipment and infrastructure enable training on Joint Deployment, Situational Awareness, and Global Force Management applications. The Situational Awareness application, Common Operating Picture, will be upgraded to a new version which will require entirely new hardware\/software to create a realistic and effective training environment. Funding ends in FY 2017 and has been moved to OM in the out years.\n\nb.  USSTRATCOM requires procurement funding for hardware and software capabilities to preserve and expand current range infrastructure.  The funding for hardware and software capabilities to preserve and expand current range infrastructure. The current Cyber Range Instrumentation procures a Cyberspace Training Range to support United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)-led CYBER FLAG, CYBER GUARD, and CYBER KNIGHT exercises. As part of the Cyberspace Training Initiative, continuance and expansion of the cyber range infrastructure is needed to support the Combatant Commanders, Services and USCYBERCOM joint cyber training and exercise requirements. The current target environment includes a Blue forces Department of Defense Information Network to include Network Operations Security Centers, a Gray network of internet spaces to include .gov and .edu domains that will emulate Internet sites and user activities, a realistic representation of an Adversary \"Red\" network, and a management (control) systems network. This emulated training environment is designed to utilize the existing elements of the Joint Information Operation Range (JIOR) as a transport layer to directly support USSTRATCOM's cyber mission. Moreover, it helps establish the Joint Force Cyber Training Range capability and directly supports the training and certification of Cyber Mission Forces. Procurement funding is imperative to increase storage capacity and improve the survivability\/durability of the target environment. Additionally, ongoing hardware modernization efforts coupled with Opposing Forces (OPFOR) software requirements necessitate CE2T2 procurement funding lines.\n\u2022 Hardware and software will provide a high fidelity immersive background for synthetic battlespace that creates interactive synthetic entities that can simulate real world systems\n\u2022 Hardware and software will be used to replicate networks in order to train the Ground Combat Element (GCE) to integrate with Tactical MAGTF Integration Course (TMIC) students in the best techniques for planning and executing combat and stability operations\n\u2022 A modular video and data system will enable warfighters to remotely downlink live surveillance images and geospatial data directly from manned and unmanned aircraft used in various trainings\n\u2022 Procurement of PLEXComm 16 Channel LVC Systems that provide interface between N-NC tactical level (AFNORTH DTC, EADS, 176 ACS, 169 ACWS) communications panels and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) voice communications\n\u2022 Enhance the existing Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) based interface to the current Simulation Scenario Generator (SSG) of Battle Control System \u2013 Fixed (BCS-F)\n\u2022 Distributed Mission Operations DIS based simulation tools to provide a distributed stimuli to the real-world BCS-F system, supporting Simulated only and Simulated over live training events\n\u2022 Creation of cyber-contested environments in joint exercises to force cyber defenders to demonstrate ability to defeat\/mitigate cyber attacks\n\nc.  Joint Interoperability Division (JID): JID affords datalink computers, radios, antennas, crypto, and Link-16 simulator equipment for the Joint Interface Control Cell \u2013 Pope. Additionally, JID refreshes IT computers and accessories for two classrooms, five Mobile Training Teams and 58 administrative offices to enable joint\/coalition training of 1,700 US and 400 Allied\/Coalition students in the employment, planning, and management of tactical data links and joint C4I interoperability.  JID is a critical enabler to the T2 program as sole DoD provider Tactical Data Link (TDL)\/JICO training and ops. Funding procures one Multifunctional Information Distribution System \u2013 Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS \/ MIDS-J). The MIDS-J is the future, software programmable four-channel (from 2 MHz \u2013 2 GHz) Link-16, Enhanced Throughput, Frequency Remapping, Wideband Networking Waveform, UHF\/VHF specialized radio that brings real-time situational awareness, location, targeting, and C2 data to smart bombs, mobile, dispersed joint forces on foot or operating in tactical vehicles in the Air, Land, or Maritime environments. The MIDS-J radio system is required to support planning, implementation, and operations of mobile network connectivity to tactical war fighters and disadvantaged platforms such as ground vehicles, helicopters, unmanned aircraft, and small boats. Currently, MIDS-J is onboard the F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet fighter family, the E-8C JSTARS battlefield surveillance & communication aircraft, and the RC-135 Rivet Joint airplane. Future weapon systems include the EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare variant of the Hercules turboprop, E-2 Hawkeye and AWACS air\/maritime surveillance airplanes,  as well the Navy's aircraft carriers, destroyers, and cruisers. The USAF will eventually field it on F-15E Strike Eagles, its B-1B and B-52H bombers, Special Operations aircraft (mostly C-130 variants like the Compass Call), and Ground C2 & ISR units.\n\nThe overall effect of the CE2T2 transfer is a net-zero profile change for the Department in FY 2018."

The program will begin a transition throughout the FYDP from the Mk-117 JATO to the Mk-85 RATO to support the change in requirement."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "The FY 2018 baseline funding is required for Mk-117 procurement to enable continued BQM-74 target operations.  Funding supports deliveries to match the anticipated expenditures to support the Navy surface fleet to conduct pre-deployment training. In addition, starting in FY2018, procurements for the Mk-85 Rocket Assisted Take Offs (RATOs) will begin. The RATOs are required in accordance with the fleet needs\/fielding of the BQM-177 and to maintain inventory levels for fleet training and qualification usage with the new Subsonic Aerial Target. Procurements through the FYDP are for operationally configured units to satisfy the requirement of applicable specifications of RATO. The Mk-85 RATO also requires the procurement of an appropriate container that is shipboard certified.  \n\nAdditional Baseline funding is required for production support to include production engineering support, integrated logistics support, and reliability life (i.e. safety and product improvement program, and quality assurance and acceptance testing). During the Mk-117\/Mk-85 transition, production support costs will increase to support both variants.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) is required to procure MK 117 JATOs used in pre-deployment combat qualification exercises in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel, replenishing actual supply levels."

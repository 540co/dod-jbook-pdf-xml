            "val": "This program supports the Army Modernization priorities (Build a More Lethal Force) through enhancement of Joint Lethality in contested environments by minimizing and eliminating erosion of close combat capability relative to peer competitors in complex terrain as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (NDS). Program to conduct investigative engineering studies, procure modifications or conversions of sniper weapons and related system components, Advanced Sniper Accessory Kit (ASAK) items, M151 Spotting Scope System, Tactical Tripod Kit (TTK) components, sniper optics, laser range finders, and ballistic compensating systems. Initial buys of items to support or meet operational needs and lighten sniper load. It includes the procurement of rifle scope optics, spotting scopes, an accompanying Accessory Interface Mounting kit (AIM), and improved capabilities including an enhanced Army common mil-radian reticle pattern to recognize and engage targets at longer ranges and lower light levels increasing hit probability. This program also provides improved ancillary equipment such as intelligent rails, ballistic chronographs, Ballistic Weather Meter (BWM), Sniper Scope Covert Cap, Weapon Tripod Cradle, Sniper Data Board, improved Sniper Buttstock, Sniper Tool Kit, Sniper Accessory Mount, improved and\/or recalibrated barrels, fire controls, muzzles with suppressors, other components, and support costs. The current Army fleet of sniper weapons, consisting of the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (EBR) as interim Squad Designated Marksman weapon, the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS), the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle (ESR), and the M107 Semi-Automatic Long Range Sniper Rifle (LRSR), require continuous upgrades to the weapon, components, and\/or ancillary equipment. Sniper upgrades seek to enhance sniper mission capability, effectiveness, and survivability by extending the sniper's influence through emerging technologies in perfecting ballistics with exacting hardware and precise calculations, reducing sniper team burden through decreased weight and enhanced ergonomics, portability, signature-reduction, faster more precise target reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and precision aiming with automated ballistic prediction systems. Upgrades also support sniper\/spotter mission collaboration with information sharing of targets and better situational awareness."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.898 million supports the Active Army through engineering studies and procurement of weapon conversions using engineering change proposals (ECP's). It also supports procurement of modifications or upgrades and additional components to be included in Advanced Sniper Accessory Kits (ASAK) and M151 Spotting Scope System, such as the Ballistic Weather Meter (BWM), Sniper Scope Covert Cap, Weapon Tripod Cradle, Sniper Data Board, and the Accessory Interface Mounting (AIM) kit, respectively. Continued support for modifications of the M110 SASS, M2010 ESR, and M107 LRSR Modifications. These studies, modifications, and upgrades provide a more full-spectrum and versatile suite of sniper rifles that improves ergonomics, survivability, capability, and portability without sacrificing performance, accuracy and reliability. Efforts also include evaluation and\/or validation of any proposed ECP's regarding sniper optics and any ancillary equipment enhancements that can include performing engineering studies to investigate the proposed enhancements and also to procure samples for evaluation.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

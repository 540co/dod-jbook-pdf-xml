These funds provide for the procurement and installation of hardware\/software products\/components which are not a part of a current Program of Record (POR) and have been evaluated and approved through the Army's Agile NIE process for inclusion into the Army's Capability Sets (CS) Synchronized Fielding plan.  Hardware\/software products\/component include the tested and approved system, vehicle mounting hardware (A-Kits), and ancillary equipment such as power amplifiers\/splitters, GPS units, loudspeakers, routers, battery isolators, filters, cables, connectors, AC inverters, utility outlets, environmental control units (ECU), fans, thermal & power switches, diplexers, and antennas.\n\nBCT Emerging Technologies also supports the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) efforts to provide capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.  The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders' needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.  The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and\/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment."

The Industrial Facilities (IF) budget line also establishes, augments and improves ammunition production capabilities through strategic modernization efforts, expands production capacity, maintains environmental compliance, and improves quality of work environment and safety at ammunition plants, as well as emergency modernization and associated construction to address production disruptions at various sites.\n\nThis budget line provides funding for preservation, storage and movement of real property facilities and equipment required for anticipated future requirements at active and inactive Army ammunition installations, also known as Layaway of Industrial Facilities (LIF) activities.  Funding will also support consolidation of laid-away production equipment and redistribution of production equipment that cannot be stored on-site.  Laid-away efforts will also include retaining critical operational and technical knowledge of production equipment, such as engineering designs, process data and control manufacturing practices.  Efforts will also include safety-related decontamination, disposal and demolition of production equipment and facilities, and environmental site assessments.\n\nProcurement funds also support the Maintenance of Inactive Facilities (MIF) to include utilities, buildings, plant equipment, special tooling, and special test equipment being retained to support future production requirements.  Additional efforts include support of associated MIF costs such as grounds maintenance, fire protection, equipment security, and administrative support."

Funds support modernization projects to expand the production capacity of RDX at Holston AAP.  Efforts include construction of new analytical lab, construction of a Fluid Energy Mill (FEM) RDX wastewater point source treatment facility, and modernization efforts to improve Ammonium Nitrate Solution (ANSOL) filtration requirements.  Funds also support infrastructure upgrades at Holston, Iowa, Lake City, Radford, and Scranton AAP and critical work environmental projects, improvements for personnel safety and health, and efforts to maintain environmental compliance at the ammunition plants.  Funds will provide for engineering support of industrial facilities, pre-design efforts for future-year modernization projects and procurement efforts at Aberdeen and Yuma Test Centers to include production acceptance tests for various ammunition end items.\n\nFY 2019 funding also supports the protection and preservation of industrial facilities at active and inactive Army ammunition installations and equipment that are no longer required for current production but must be retained for future peacetime or emergency production needs.  Funds support the decontamination and demolition of excess production equipment and facilities buildings at Lake city and Radford AAP and the layaway of various load, assemble and pack production lines at Milan AAP.  Funds will also support the disposal of excess equipment at McAlester AAP.  \n\nFY 2019 funding supports the care and maintenance of laid-away equipment and facilities at active and inactive ammunition installations."

            "val": "This program provides a combination of US Navy projects planned to counter the threat to amphibious landing forces from known and projected foreign land\/sea mines, obstacles in the beach zone and surf zone approaches to amphibious assault areas.  It is a system of systems (Countermine\/Counter Obstacle, Intelligence\/Surveillance\/Reconnaissance\/Targeting (ISR\/T), Navigation\/Virtual Marking\/Integration, C4I\/Data Fusion) to provide a full assault breaching capability.  This program is an essential element to the Marine Corps Ship To Objective Maneuver Concept of Operations.\n\nThis procurement line supports the COBRA program of record, delivering COBRA systems to Navy helicopter wings to provide initial proficiency training to Navy aircrews.  COBRA systems are also procured under BLI 1601 LCS Mission Modules.  The 1601 COBRA systems provide the deployable combat capability to LCS mission packages.\n\n[P5 \/ SW004: COASTAL BATTLEFIELD RECONNAISSANCE AND ANALYSIS (COBRA)]: The mission of the AN\/DVS-1 COBRA is to conduct unmanned aerial tactical reconnaissance in the littoral battlespace for detection and localization of minefields and obstacles in the surf zone and beach zone prior to an amphibious assault. The COBRA Airborne Payload will be carried on the MQ-8B Fire Scout.  This allows operators and other personnel to remain at a safe distance from the mine and obstacle belts and enemy direct and indirect fire. COBRA will be embarked in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the Mine Countermeasures Mission Package (MP).\n\nCOBRA provides the (ISR\/T) part of the Assault Breaching System of systems.  One system consists of two Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) Payloads and one Post Mission Analysis Station.  Under the umbrella of evolutionary acquisition, three increments of development are planned.  Block I introduces a daytime, surface laid minefield and obstacle detection capability for the Beach Zone.  Block II adds a surfzone and night (darkness) detection capability.  Block III adds a buried mine detection capability and on-board Near-Real-Time processing of Multi Spectral Imagery data.  COBRA will be a modular payload architecture of, and integrated with, the MQ-8B Fire Scout VTUAV and will serve as a \"detect\" sensor within the LCS Mine Warfare mission package as part of amphibious assault breaching."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2018 funding supports the baseline program which will procure one COBRA system to be integrated on the MQ-8B FIRESCOUT. These systems provide the fleet with the required training assets to certify the pilots and crew to operate and maintain these systems before being deployed on the LCS."

            "val": "Beginning in FY 2020, MARINE CORPS CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS GROUP (MCCOG), and UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS FORCES CYBERSPACE COMMAND (MARFORCYBER) were transferred to a new procurement line item, 4645 Cyberspace Activities, in order to consolidate Marine Corps Cyberspace Procurement Activities into one LI.  \n\nMARINE CORPS COMMON HARDWARE SUITE (MCHS) provides Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) laptops, workstations, software, servers, and other information technology (IT) hardware devices (ie Mobility) to support the Operating Forces and other Marine Corps customers. MCHS provides support for two principal groups: 1) United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical and Functional Programs of Record that use COTS IT hardware as part of their fielded systems, and 2) tactical and other Marine Corps customers not supported by Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) such as Marine Corps Forces, Europe; Marine Corps Forces, Korea; Marine Corps Forces, Africa; and stand-alone Marine Corps units and schoolhouses.\n\nFORMALIZED SCHOOLS TECHNICAL REFRESH (FSTR) funds and manages the software and IT hardware required to provide a robust and reliable Computer-Based Training (CBT) capability for TECOM (Training and Education Command) schools. Computers used in TECOM classrooms are not funded or managed by HQMC as part of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), and must therefore be funded and managed by the FSTR program.  This program standardizes IT equipment for the 812 classrooms throughout TECOM and formalizes the upgrade and refresh process.  In order to maintain adequate reliability and software compliance, computers need to be refreshed every four years. FSTR provides reliable hardware, software, and network resources to support Marine Corps Programs of Instruction and curriculum, delivered in TECOM formal classrooms.  The FSTR program is foundational to realizing the Commandant of the Marine Corps' vision of exploiting technology as an enabler to advance Training & Education capabilities.\n\nMARINE CORPS ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES (MCEITS) provides an overarching portfolio of capabilities to deliver \"Power to the Edge\" for the Marine Corps.  Born from an effort to establish a Continuity of Operations Plan of Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) Automated Information Systems, MCEITS is a unifying framework of both the Net-Centric Enterprise Services to be delivered, and the infrastructure and systems which must be deployed to enable delivery of those services.  MCEITS realigns the existing USMC environment of applications, databases, networks, and facilities into an integrated architecture. It provides the environment to access enterprise shared data and services while improving operational flexibility, responsiveness, and effectiveness for operating forces and the supporting establishment based on a common infrastructure and shared services.  MCEITS allows for achievement of architectural standardization, consolidated management, seamless interoperability, and access to the data residing in our currently fielded applications (business and tactical).  MCEITS enables access to enterprise information and provides the ability to collaborate and share information across the business and warfighter domains.  MCEITS includes work to rationalize, modernize, virtualize, migrate, and host systems and applications residing in the Marine Corps enterprise information technology center (i.e., data center) located in Kansas City, Missouri. Additionally, MCEITS has a secondary, fail-over site located in Camp Lejuene, North Carolina, a System Integration Environment (SIE), and two Distributed Platforms.  Procurement funding provides for various computers,network equipment, racks, etc., and associated installation costs.\n\nMARINE CORPS RECRUITING INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEM (MCRISS) is an enterprise level system to automate administrative procedures for recruiting station operations. This customized automated System, centered on procedures in the Guidebook for Recruiters, Volume I, dramatically improves efficiency and effectiveness in Marine Corps recruiting.  Furthermore, Military Entrance Processing Command requires Marine Corps recruiting to provide information in electronic format only. MCRISS is the Marine Corps Recruiting Command's program to manage applicant processing from commitment to accession\/commission into the Marine Corps and Marine Corps Reserve. This enterprise approach allows for efficient sharing of information about potential recruits and recruiter screening efforts, yielding a more cost effective process.\n\nMARINE CORPS CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS GROUP (MCCOG) (formerly MCNOSC) executes Marine Corps Global Information Grid Operations and Marine Corps Defensive Cyber Operations in support of Marine Corps operational requirements in order to enhance freedom of action across all warfighting domains, while denying the efforts of adversaries to degrade or disrupt this advantage through cyberspace.  MCCOG is the Network Operations (NETOPS) component of Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command and provides network situational awareness, command and control, and technical support to Marine Corps operating forces and supporting establishment organizations, both in garrison and while deployed. MCCOG is the primary DOD Computer Network Defense Service Provider for the U.S. Marine Corps and directs Service actions to prevent and respond to security incidents. The MCCOG delivers numerous enterprise services for the Marine Corps, to include mainframe computer services management, Defense Message System (DMS), DOD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), and Active Directory\/Global Address List. The MCCOG is responsible for the operations and defense of MCEITS, which delivers data center services to the Marine Corps. Finally, MCCOG provides technical expertise to HQMC, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), and Marine Corps organizations around the world in support of Information Technology initiatives undertaken within the Marine Corps and DOD. The PMC funding will support Core Competencies in the Computer Networks Defense and NETOPS areas with skilled cyber-warriors (24x7x365).  The added responsibilities and network security events have required continued operational employment of current assets and personnel. PMC funding is based on increased mission requirements dictated by DoD\/USSTRATCOM\/USCYBERCOM to defend the network. The procurement funding will be used to refresh the MCCOG Alternate Network Operations Security Center, USMC Site R refresh, Network Common Operational Picture Tools, Host Based Security Systems, Secure Configuration Compliance Validation Initiative and Secure Configuration Remediation Initiative (SCCVI\/SCRI), Intrusion Prevention and scanning tools, Virtual Private Network, and other operations and defense tools.  Beginning in FY20 this effort moves to LI 4645.\n\nSECURE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS (SONIC) program provides funding to procure and support hardware, software, infrastructure and services necessary to support and improve critical C2 network operations. This funding enables central management of refresh and sustainment of hardware, software, and the infrastructure necessary to provide network services on the USMC Garrison SIPRNET.  This ensures enterprise architecture goals and standards are established and maintained and takes advantage of quantity-related discounts. The SIPRNET provides Marine Corps garrison forces with a secure digital means to communicate and share data, information, and knowledge at the secret level with dispersed organizations located around the world. SONIC resources the tech refresh of technologically obsolete equipment, shortfalls in network operational capabilities, solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities, and technology insertion for increased SIPRNET capability as expressed by the Marine Corps Forces (MARFORs). Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, and functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATION PROGRAM (MCIOP) supports DOD capabilities based analysis (CBA) to address emerging Marine Air Ground Task Force C2 program and cyberspace requirements. MCIOP supports Information Operations (IO) Range research\/modeling\/simulation conducted by Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL), industry, and\/or academia to explore existing and emergent Information Operations initiatives and cyber technologies.\n\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS FORCES CYBERSPACE COMMAND (MARFORCYBER) will procure hardware and software for Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS).  DMSS kits are maintained with hardware support and software renewals, and refresh perpetual software licenses for DMSS kits. Beginning in FY20 this effort moves to LI 4645.\n\nPAPERLESS ACQUISITION (PA) SYSTEMS is comprised of two programs, Purchase Request Builder (PR Builder) and Standard Procurement System \/ Procurement Desktop Defense (SPS\/PD2).  PR Builder is a fully web-based, Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III sensitive business system.  SPS\/PD2, part of the Joint SPS Acquisition Program, is the USMC's authoritative contracting generation system within the Marine Corps' electronic Systems Business Enterprise.  Both of these systems provide system-to-system interface with other DoD financial management systems which include Standard Accounting, Budgeting, and Reporting System (SABRS), Federal Government's Electronic Document Access system (EDA), and Invoice, Receipt Acceptance and Property Transfer.\n\nTECHNOLOGY SERVICES ORGANIZATION (TSO):provides development, testing, and production hosting environments in support of the Marine Corps enterprise pay, personnel, accounting and financial management systems to include Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS), Marine Online, Marine Corps Orders Resource System (MCORS), Standards Accounting, Budgeting and Reporting System (SABRS), and the Marine Corps Financial Integrated Analysis System (MCFIAS). The TSO also provides complete SDLC activities for these systems as well as development of the Navy, Air Guard, and Air Force Reserve Order Writing Systems. The TSO is implementing the Marine Corp's SABRS application to the Department of the Navy.\n\nPROFESSIONALL DEVELOPMENT - MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY:  The Professional Development Program develops, delivers, and evaluates Professional Military Education (PME) and training through resident and distance education programs to prepare leaders to meet the challenges of the national security environment. The .edu expansion provides wireless connectivity, information sharing, and audio visual capabilities in support of Education Command's effort to modernize PME. Having .edu networks at all of the Marine Corp University campuses creates the opportunity for courses to collaborate, conduct research, wargame, and conduct video teleconferencing.\n\n[P40A \/ Data Center Tech Refresh]: Datacenter Tech Refresh (Cost Element 1.3.7) funding decreased from $19.118M in FY 2019 to $18.010M in FY 2020, a $1.108M decrease. This is due to a strategic change to incrementally implement tech refresh annually instead of a 5-year \"rip and replace\" strategy. Infrastructure procured under this cost element will replace equipment essential to sustaining capabilities in the datacenter.  The replacement of aging and non-compliant infrastructure is required to support emerging cybersecurity standards and compliance directives.  If infrastructure is not replaced, this will put the existing system at risk for Cybersecurity vulnerabilities which result in the inability to share critical mission essential data across the Marine Corps."

Funding supports additional application migrations and hardware\/software procurements for the Application and Development\/test environment and sustainment engineering changes. \n\nMARINE CORPS RECRUITING INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEM (MCRISS)\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $0.362M; Funding supports mission critical software licenses required to support the Modernization of Marine Corps Recruiting Information Support System.\n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATION PROGRAM (MCIOP)\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $0.408M provides mission critical hardware and software that are specific to the needs of the intelligence environment. Modeling and simulation explores existing and emergent Information Operations (IO) initiatives and cyber technologies. \n\nPAPERLESS ACQUISITION (PA) SYSTEMS\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $0.124M provides mission critical hardware required to support the needs of Paperless Acquisition Systems such as Standard Procurement System (SPS), Electronic Procurement System (EPS), and Purchase Request Builder (PRB).  \n\nTECHNOLOGY SERVICES ORGANIZATION (TSO)\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation request: $0.878M supports laptop and server refresh to include hardware and software supporting the development of Marine Corps enterprise HRM and Financial Management systems. \n\nMARINE CORPS CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS GROUP (MCCOG):\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $7.683M procures hardware and software for Defensive Cyber Operations support and network infrastructure upgrades.  \n\nMARFORCYBER:\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $13.348M procures hardware and software for Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS). DMSS kits are maintained with hardware support, software renewals, and refresh perpetual software licenses.  DMSS kits are required in order for MARFORCYBER to support Marine Corps units all across the globe.  $8.488M procures DMSS kits for MARFORCYBER and $4.860M procures DMSS kits for the Marine Corps Operating Forces.  \n\nFY 2020 Justifications: \n\nMarine Corps Common Hardware (MCHS) \nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $0.953M will support the purchase of hardware\/software for Marine Forces Europe\/Marine Forces Korea (MARFORE\/MARFORK) and the Enterprise Staging & Warehousing effort (ES&W) that includes the receipt, inventory, imaging, kitting, and shipping (RIIKS) of IT hardware to MFE\/MFA, MFK, and OPFORs (shipped in a standard configuration ready to use).\n\nEnd User Device (Cost Element 1.2) funding increased from $0.712M in FY 2019 to $0.731M in FY 2020, a $0.019M increase, due to the replacement End User Devices (EUDs) that are becoming non-compliant for users at MARFORK and MARFOREUR, this replacement will enable users to remain connected to the network with a fully compliant EUD.  Unit costs increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 due to inflation.  \n\nFielding Support (Cost Element 1.6) $0.222M will support the fielding of equipment that is procured through other customer funds.  The type of support provided includes the creation of the birth record for equipment to ensure that the equipment can be accounted for in property accountability systems, along with configuring and kitting the equipment to ensure it is consistent with Marine Corps IT standards.\n\n\nFORMALIZED SCHOOLS TECHNICAL REFRESH (FSTR)\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $6.905M funding will support Training and Education Command (TECOM) schoolhouse classroom computer refresh and tablet procurements.  The Marine Corps operates 62 Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) producing schools, with an established AAO of over 10,000 computers, required to deliver training and education curriculum.  Costs are driven by IT equipment refresh, enterprise software licensing, computer imaging\/shipping, and industry best practices.\n\nSECURE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNICATIONS (SONIC)\nFY 2020 Baseline Appropriation Request: $13.946M will ensure the Marine Corps continues to defend and protect the MCEN-S against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.  The overall FY20 funding increase of $0.652M from FY 2019 reflects the Marine Corps decision to align resources to Secure Operational Network Infrastructure and Communications enhancement in order to replace aging and end-of-life network infrastructure.  This increases the Marine Corps Enterprise Network's reliability and security posture against cyberattacks from both Nation-States and third party actors.  The baseline appropriations request also includes $9K which is needed to procure Classified End User Devices in support of MCB Guam personnel.\n\nEnd User Device (Cost Element 5.1) funding increased from $3.000M in FY 2019 to $4.000M in FY 2020, a $1.000M increase, due to the replacement of Classified End User Devices (EUDs)  enabling users to remain connected to the network with a fully compliant EUD.  Replacing the aging EUDs will reduce the cybersecurity vulnerabilities arising from these items no longer receiving support or updates.  If these EUDs are not replaced, it will be necessary for these users to be removed from the network to protect against cyber threats, thereby resulting in an inability to perform mission essential duties.\n  \nThe Field Support (Cost Element 5.2) funding increased from $0.254M in FY 2019 to $0.268M in FY 2020, a $0.014M increase, due to increasing the quantity of 2,683 laptops procured in FY 2020 to replace aging Classified EUDs, which were procured at the beginning stages of the WIN 10 implementation.  This cost element is directly related to changes in cost elements 5.1 and 5.3.\n\nNetwork Equipment Tech Refresh (Cost Element 5.3) funding decreased from $6.847M in FY 2019 to $5.598M in FY 2020, a $1.249M decrease, due to reprioritizing efforts from Cost Elements 5.3 to Cost Element 5.4 for the modernization of service equipment upgrading and modernizing the Classified Enterprise Service Stacks (ESS-S).  This reprioritization aligns with the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy which focuses on transforming and optimizing the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN). In addition, the equipment procured under this cost element will be replacing outdated equipment that is no longer receiving security patches or updates from the vendor, increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the MCEN-S.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a result of not receiving cybersecurity updates which will lead to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  Funding within this cost element will enable the Marine Corps to replace these aging network devices with ones that are compliant with current cybersecurity standards which will enable users across the Marine Corps to continue to operate without network disruptions.\n  \nEnterprise Infrastructure Modernization Classified (EIM-S) (Cost Element 5.4) funding increased from $3.000M in FY 2019 to $4.080M in FY 2020, a $1.080M increase, for the modernization of the Classified Enterprise Infrastructure.  Funding under this cost element provides for upgrading and modernizing the Classified Enterprise Service Stacks (ESS-S), Classified Installation Processing Nodes CLASSIFIED (IPN-S), Classified Installation Service Node (ISN-S) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) across the Marine Corps within the classified environment.  These modernizations will support the Marine Corps' ability to migrate to the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the cloud by increasing bandwidth, enhancing individual and organizational mobility, and supporting the rapid deployment of mission critical applications and services.  In addition, the migration to the cloud will result in reduced long network engineering\/provision lead times.\n\nNetwork Access Control Compliance and Remediation (Cost Element 5.5) funding decreased from $.184M in FY 2019 to $0M in FY 2020, a $.184M decrease due to the completion of initial fielding of the discovery tool identifying the physical devices on the network.   \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATION PROGRAM (MCIOP)\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $0.416M supports additional hardware refreshes and also will provide mission critical hardware and software that is specific to the needs of the intelligence environment. Modeling and simulation explores existing and emergent Information Operations (IO) initiatives and cyber technologies. The $0.008M increase in funding from FY19 to FY20 is due to the hardware refresh schedule.\n\nMARINE CORPS RECRUITING INFORMATION SUPPORT SYSTEM (MCRISS)\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $0.050M will support software licenses which are mission critical and required to support the Modernization of Marine Corps Recruiting Information Support System.\n\nPAPERLESS ACQUISITION (PA) SYSTEMS\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $0.127M will provide mission critical hardware required to support the needs of Paperless Acquisition Systems such as Standard Procurement System (SPS), Electronic Procurement System (EPS), and Purchase Request Builder (PRB).\n\nMARINE CORPS ENTERPRISE IT SERVICES (MCEITS)\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $18.010M supports technical refresh for all MCEITS IT Center infrastructures hosting environments.  Funding supports additional application migrations, hardware\/software procurements for the Application and Development\/test environment, and sustainment engineering changes. \n\nDatacenter Tech Refresh (Cost Element 1.3.7) funding decreased from $19.118M in FY 2019 to $18.010M in FY 2020, a $1.108M decrease. This is due to a strategic change to incrementally implement tech refresh annually instead of a 5-year \"rip and replace\" strategy. Infrastructure procured under this cost element will replace equipment essential to sustaining capabilities in the datacenter.  The replacement of aging and non-compliant infrastructure is required to support emerging cybersecurity standards and compliance directives.  If infrastructure is not replaced, this will put the existing system at risk for Cybersecurity vulnerabilities which result in the inability to share critical mission essential data across the Marine Corps.\n\nData Center Domain Consolidation (Cost Element 1.3.8) funding decreased from $10.060M in FY 2019 to $0.000M in FY 2020.  This effort completed in FY 2019.\n\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT - MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation Request: $6.796M.  $1.478M will support the .edu network capacity upgrade will allow five Staff Non-Commissioned Officer Academies (SNCOA) at locations CONUS and OCONUS to be brought on the .edu network. The current network which supports only Marine Corps University at Marine Corps Base Quantico and the SNCOA at Camp Johnson is at capacity which does not allow for any additional capabilities.\n$5.318M will support the SNCOA, Camp Pendleton .edu expansion will provide wireless connectivity, information sharing and audio visual capabilities in support of EDCOM's effort to modernize Professional Military Education (PME). This is the next step in expanding the capability which ensures that students receive the same access to information and education that students attending the Quantico and CP Johnson campuses receive.  SNCOA campuses that rely on the .mil network for access to resources are restricted and often blocked from sites not approved by .mil hardening efforts. Having .edu networks at all of the MCU campuses creates the opportunity for courses to collaborate, conduct research, wargame, and conduct video teleconferencing.\n\nTECHNOLOGY SERVICES ORGANIZATION (TSO)\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation request: $3.891M supports laptop and network device procurement that enables the development of Marine Corps enterprise HRM and Financial Management systems.  This includes the maintenance of the Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS), Marine Online (MOL), Marine Corps Orders Resource System (MCORS), Standard Accounting, Budgeting & Reporting System (SABRS) and the Marine Corps Financial Integrated Analysis System (MCFIAS).  This Technical refresh\/upgrade of SABRS database technology from ADABAS to a newer database architecture provides a modern and well-supported database technology that ultimately enables the normalization of Marine Corps financial data in a true relational database. The increase of $3M from FY19 to FY20 is funding for MOL Modernization as part of the HR2025 initiative."

This reprioritization aligns with the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy which focuses on transforming and optimizing the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN). In addition, the equipment procured under this cost element will be replacing outdated equipment that is no longer receiving security patches or updates from the vendor, increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities across the MCEN-S.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a result of not receiving cybersecurity updates which will lead to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  Funding within this cost element will enable the Marine Corps to replace these aging network devices with ones that are compliant with current cybersecurity standards which will enable users across the Marine Corps to continue to operate without network disruptions.",

            "val": "Soldier and Small Unit Power systems enable dismounted Soldiers and squads to execute their missions with significantly less battery weight and enable longer missions without a daily unit re-supply of batteries.  These improved renewable systems enable the warfighter to sustain themselves for extended mission duration in the most austere operating environments. \n\nThe Integrated Soldier Power and Data System-Core (ISPDS-C), Conformal Wearable Battery (CWB), and Squad Power Manager (SPM) fill the power and energy gaps created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, such as situational awareness displays, GPS systems, weapon sensors, radios, and other devices.  Specific systems of Soldier Power Integrated (SPI) are the ISPDS-C, the CWB and the SPM.  These power solutions are intended for use in the most austere operating environments and include, but are not limited to, individual Soldier worn systems, integrated power management, and renewable energy.  SPI systems will enable dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions more efficiently, for longer durations and with fewer battery resupplies and also reduce the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries, and allow dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train.  This effort is consistent with the Soldier Protection Capability Development Document (CDD) (March 2011), Operational Energy Initial Capabilities Document (26 April 2012), the Sep 2013 Small Unit Power CDD (26 September 2013), and the draft SPM, ISPDS-C with Conformal Central Power Source (CCPS) Capability Production Document.\n\nThe Universal Battery Charger (UBC) fills the power and energy gap created by the increase in mission essential, Soldier portable power consumers, by providing a sole charging solution capable of providing power to handheld communication devices and a suite of military batteries. The UBC charging solution is suited for the platoon and intended for use in the most austere operating environments.  The UBC enables dismounted Soldiers to execute their missions with fewer battery resupplies, thus reducing the logistical burden associated with moving fuel and primary (disposable) batteries.  The UBC capability also allows dismounted Soldiers to operate independently for longer missions without being tethered to a large generator, vehicle, or supply train. This effort is consistent with the Operational Energy ICD (26 April 2012) and the Universal Battery Charger CPD (27 May 2015)."

            "val": "FY18 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $7.370 procures and fields Integrated Soldier Power Data System - Core and $3.086 million procures Universal Battery Chargers and associated equipment. \n\nThe increased digital capability of electronic devices generates an increased demand for power. Historically, innovations in Soldier power struggle to keep pace with the growing power requirements that accompany these increased capabilities. Additionally, batteries add weight that consumes more space in the combat load.  Power management is a significant mission planning consideration for the dismounted squad leader who manages combat loads. Dismounted squads operating in the most austere environments have traditionally carried enough batteries to sustain individual Soldier devices for up to 72 hours before resupply. Small Unit Power seeks to reduce the number of batteries that the Soldier must carry to reduce the combat load. The Soldier and the squad are the centerpiece of the modernization strategy, as the U.S. Army develops strategies to effectively equip and train the Soldier of Force 2025; it must reconcile how to power the growing number of Soldier-worn devices while also reducing the Soldier's battery load and decreasing the logistical demand for battery resupply.  Soldier and small unit power systems reduce the number of logistical convoys pushing supplies to the forward edge of the battlefield and associated cost and risk involved with battery and fuel resupply missions."

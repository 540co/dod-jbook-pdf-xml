The UH-72A will conduct general support utility helicopter missions and execute tasks as part of an integrated effort with other joint services, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The UH-72A provides time-sensitive transport of supplies or key personnel, air mobility to assist civil authorities through the execution of search and rescue or disaster relief operations, advanced warning\/detection of external threats to include threats to our borders, augmentation of air ambulance capabilities, and limited command and control operations in the conduct of HLS. As part of the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) the UH-72A became the primary training aircraft at the US Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) in Ft Rucker. The UH-72A program is currently in full rate production."

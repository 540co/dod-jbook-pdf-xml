            "val": "AGM-114 Hellfire is a family of laser guided missiles employed against point and moving targets by both rotary and fixed wing aircraft.  The family of Hellfire missiles includes, but is not limited to, AGM-114B\/K\/K2\/K2A\/M\/N\/N-5\/P\/P+\/Q\/Q6 variants.  These variants include shaped charge warheads for use against armored targets and blast fragmentation warheads for use against urban structures.  The AGM-114N is a thermobaric blast fragmentation warhead that maintains the capability provided by the AGM-114M while adding a unique capability against confined compartmented spaces, a typical target type observed in current combat operations.  Other variants include the K2A, which has a blast frag sleeve for use against soft-skinned tactical vehicles, the N5, which provides a trajectory shaping capability to increase endgame lethality against vertical structures, and the P\/P+ variants, which include high altitude launch trajectories for use from fixed-wing aircraft.  Additionally, the Q and Q6 variants have inert warheads, which are used for training on ranges that do not allow live warheads, and to preserve tactical missiles for use in combat.  Conversions from one variant to another are done on an as needed basis.\n\nPrior year funding includes Hellfire, Viper Strike, and Griffin."

Pre-Deployment training for OCO includes Hellfire training shots to gain proficiency for aircrew and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs).  Without replenishment of these assets, aircrew and JTAC readiness for combat operations will be reduced."

            "val": "FY 2018 funding request reflects a reduction of $1.984 million to account for the availability of prior year funds.\n\nThe Operating Forces IPE Budget has been restructured to identify and break out individual component costs previously consolidated within Item Numbers in previous Budget submits.\n\nThe Operating Forces IPE budget provides funding for capitalized personal property procurements for the Naval Shipyards and Fleet I-level maintenance activities.  These procurements provide new and efficiency-enabling equipment required to support submarine, CVN, and surface ship maintenance, eliminating reliance on significantly aged and obsolete equipment.  Average age of existing equipment infrastructure is 21 years, over twice the average age of comparable private industry equipment.  Improved maintenance capabilities at the activities supported by the Capital Investment Program and Ship Maintenance Investment Program are integral to the Nuclear Enterprise.  Modernizing equipment infrastructure improves maintenance activity productivity, eliminates workaround and mitigation costs to the Fleet, contributes to decreasing CVN, surface ship, and submarine availability cost and schedule, and improves operational availability.\n\nThis budget also funds procurement and technical refresh upgrades of all Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) hardware and software aboard Surface Fleet hulls and the Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES).  NMMES is a strategic investment that has standardized NAVSEA and Fleet ship maintenance functions ashore, controlling and managing all aspects of ship maintenance at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), and Ship Repair Facilities.\n\n[P40A \/ KN100:  INDUSTRIAL PLANT EQUIPMENT (IPE) REPLACEMENT\/AFLOAT SUPPORT]: These funds are used to procure industrial plant equipment for afloat (surface combatant) activities which provide maintenance capabilities for Sailors to maintain Ship's mission essential, operational readiness while deployed.  The upgraded IPE increases deployed maintenance capability and enhances strike group's ability to remain on station through Casualty Report (CASREP) avoidance.  The program provides new industrial plant equipment to replace equipment beyond economical repair and to upgrade capabilities for ship maintenance and repair.\n\n[P40A \/ KN200:  NAVY MARITIME MAINTENANCE ENTERPRISE SOLUTION SUSTAINMENT]: This funding supports the Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES) Initiative, a strategic investment that has standardized NAVSEA and Fleet ship maintenance functions ashore, controlling and managing all aspects of ship maintenance at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), and Ship Repair Facilities.  NMMES manages finance, supply, personnel, time & attendance, repair work processes & planning, scheduling and execution, shop work flow, configuration management, environmental health & safety, quality assurance, up-line management reporting and other functions.  NMMES standardizes and institutionalizes the Navy's ship maintenance business practice processes.  These processes are fully embedded in the NMMES IT systems to gain efficiencies in the maintenance process.  NMMES systems provide the functionality and processes to continually address the maintenance needs of the Fleet, and have a critical role in the efficient brokering, planning, material ordering, financial performance, and execution of shore maintenance.  \n\nThis sustainment funding will support procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software in support of NMMES IT systems, including the Electronic Technical Work Document (ETWD) initiative.\n\n[P40A \/ NAVY MARITIME MAINTENANCE ENTERPRISE SOLUTION SUSTAINMENT]: FY18 NMMES funding above FY17 level is required for hardware supporting the Maritime Systems Environment (MSE 1.1) alternate production site that will also be the disaster recovery failover site located at Marine Corps Kansas City Enterprise IT Center (EITC).  This will enable the maintenance activities to continue working & utilizing the IT toolset when the primary site is undergoing maintenance or a shutdown is required as there was during hurricane Matthew.  Funds will also support Product Data Management (PDM) software (SW) to integrate FORD Class Carrier Program and OHIO Replacement Program (ORP) configuration and technical information during maintenance periods.\n\n[P40A \/ eTWD NEDC Hardware]: The electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) system hardware (HW) requirements are for servers required to support and sustain the eTWD environments at Navy Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) Charleston, SC, in support of data center consolidation initiative.\n\n[P40A \/ MSE 1.1 Alt. Production Site]: The Maritime Systems Environment (MSE 1.1) alternate production site will act as the emergency production site if Navy Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) Charleston has catastrophic event.  The alternate production site environment will be located at Marine Corps Kansas City Enterprise IT Center (EITC), and will provide minimal impact to ship maintenance business systems if shutdown to NEDC Charleston occurs.  Kansas City EITC also serves as the disaster recovery failover site.  This will enable the maintenance activities to continue working & utilizing the IT toolset when the primary site is undergoing maintenance or a shutdown is required as there was during hurricane Matthew. This procures the information technology hardware to build the alternate production site for the Naval Shipyards and Regional Maintenance Centers.\n\n[P40A \/ Product Data Management SW]: Product Data Management (PDM) software (SW) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software to integrate FORD Class Carrier Program and OHIO Replacement Program (ORP) configuration and technical information during maintenance periods.\n\n[P40A \/ Mobility Solutions]: Provides for the development of applications and software tools to support mobility initiatives at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers and Ship Repair Facility (SRF) Japan. This capability leverages off the wireless network and electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) projects and brings needed efficiencies to ship maintenance workers.\n\n[P40A \/ RFIDs]: This project implements Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) capability at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers, and Ship Repair Facility (SRF) Japan for both waterfront and back-shop application.  RFID will provide real-time tracking of parts and materials, creating a more efficient and productive workflow.\n\n[P40A \/ KN300:  SHIPYARD CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CIP)]: This line item provides funding for the Shipyard Capital Investment Program in support of the consolidated Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facilities (IMF) at the four mission funded Naval Shipyards.  Funds will be used for the procurement and execution of Class 3 & 4 plant and personal property projects to maintain, modernize and improve the infrastructure and industrial base at the mission funded Naval Shipyard\/IMF activities.  Funding will allow for the acquisition of equipment and OP,N related Automated Data Processing (ADP) Hardware\/Software necessary to perform the mission of repairing, conversion, and modernization of fleet ships and submarines in the most economical, efficient, environmentally sound and safe manner possible.\n\nNOTE that the budget year equipment requirements provided in this exhibit are based on current Shipyard priorities to best improve submarine and aircraft carrier availability execution within currently projected budget.  Projected costs are best government estimates based on market research and are subject to change.  Changes to program funding, realized costs, and\/or realization of emergent Shipyard equipment requirements after budget submittal could impact the requirements identified in this exhibit.\n\n[P40A \/ SHIPYARD CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CIP)]: Average age of existing naval shipyard capital equipment infrastructure is 21 years, over twice the average age of comparable private industry equipment.  Continued reliance on this significantly aged equipment infrastructure increases submarine and CVN availability costs and places schedules at risk.  This results in passing workaround costs to the Fleet and ultimately impacting Operational Availability (Ao) when equipment downtime impacts critical path maintenance requirements.  \n\nImproved maintenance capabilities at the Naval Shipyards are integral to the Nuclear Enterprise.  Procurement of new and efficiency-enabling equipment to repair CVNs and submarines contributes to decreasing availability costs and schedules, ultimately returning mission days to the Fleet and moving the needle on Shipyard throughput.\n\nFY18 Capital Investment Program funding above FY17 level is required for capital equipment needed at the Naval Shipyards to support new mission requirements, including VIRGINIA Class introduction at NNSY and concurrent VIRGINIA Class availabilities at PNSY and PHNSY, as well as recapitalization of significantly aged Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE), weight handling equipment, and nuclear support equipment infrastructure.  These additional requirements include:\n\nPHNS&IMF VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR HANDLING SYSTEM - This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs) and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities.  Without this procurement, PHNS&IMF will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance.  This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions.  \n\nNNSY VIRGINIA CLASS BOW DOME HANDLING SYSTEM - The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity.  The bow handling system procurement is critical to NNSYs mission to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance, which was accelerated with the Norfolk homeporting of USS JOHN WARNER.  \n\nPNSY and PSNSY REACTOR ACCESS ENCLOSURES (RAEs) (2 TOTAL):  These RAEs are required to support increasing submarine inactivation schedule tempo.  Existing RAEs being replaced by these procurements are well beyond expected service life, require extensive repairs between uses, and add 6 weeks to availability critical path schedule each use for setup and teardown that won't be required with the new RAE design.  These RAEs are critically needed at PSNSY and PNSY in order to support the LOS ANGELES Class inactivation availability schedules.    \n\nPSNSY (BREMERTON SITE) 25 TON PORTAL CRANE PROCUREMENTS (2 TOTAL) - This project procures two new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal cranes for PSNS&IMF, Bremerton (Shipyard site).  This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the Shipyard that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands.  This crane is designed to fill a critical capability gap for pier and dry dock support, with appropriate capacity, hook height and reach for carrier support, general lower capacity pier and drydock support, for the In-activation, Recycling and Disposal program.  Continued reliance on existing crane population will continue exposure to increasing costs to customer due to lack of support causing delays to the projects, increasing costs to maintain, support, and operate rental\/lease cranes, and increasing costs and lower efficiency  using higher capacity portal cranes to lift lighter, repetitive loads.\n\nPHNSY SEAWATER ACID FLUSH SYSTEM - This project procures a submarine Seawater Acid Flush System used for chemically cleaning copper-nickel alloy seawater cooling systems and components.  Without this portable acid flush system, PHNSY will continue to perform mechanical cleanings of fouled seawater cooling systems, continuing to place availability schedules at risk when fouling conditions are found as well as eliminating an unobtrusive, rapid defouling option when emergent seawater system fouling conditions occur, typically in warm water conditions.  This acid flush system is the only method available to complete any emergent SW system cleanings on operational submarines. The only other method of system cleaning is during a depot availability, requiring affected components, tubing, and piping to be entirely removed, hydro-blasted, inspected, and reinstalled. \n\nNNSY and PSNSY 60 TON DOCK CRANES SERVICE LIFE EXTENSIONS (3 TOTAL) - Integral to waterfront operations.  Dock cranes perform 8,000 lifts per submarine availability supporting critical path maintenance operations.  These $2M - $3M service life extensions are being performed instead of $30M (each) new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.  \n\nPSNSY VERTICLE RECIPROCATING CONVEYOR - This project replaces the existing 23 year old four-ton capacity Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor (VRC) installed in Dry Dock 04 at PSNSY.  The new VRC will be designed to be submersible and therefore can remain in dock while flooding operations occur, significantly lowering VRC operating costs.  The shipyard currently must execute workarounds due to increasing, significant downtime of the existing VRC, increasing costs due to use of a constrained Portal Crane population to move relatively light loads to support dry dock operations and increasing exposure to potentially unsafe work conditions. This is particularly germane given the anticipated increased in workload at this dry dock.\n\n[P40A \/ NETWORK STORAGE & BACKUP]: This procurement supports the technical refresh of existing storage servers on the legacy network at NNSY.\n\n[P40A \/ CVN 68\/78 CAMEL SYSTEM]: Camel system required to berth aircraft carriers at NNSY.  Existing system is well beyond expected service life and will not support current tidal and storm surge requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR HANDLING SYSTEM]: This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs) and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities. Without this procurement, PNSY will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance. This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA CLASS BOW DOME RING HANDLING SYSTEM]: This project procures a bow dome handling system for PNSY. The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity. Without the bow handling system procurement, PNSY will be unable to perform mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR ENCLOSURE]: Required to support concurrent VIRGINIA Class dry dock availabilities at PNSY. This project provides a set of three partially enclosed towers and connecting roof that will be used individually or in combination to support Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tile repair, hull inspection, sonar dome repair, hull penetration repair, submarine access, equipment mounting and collectively to support VIRGINIA Class propulsor\/shaft replacement.\n\n[P40A \/ INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA STORAGE REFRESH]: This project replaces Information Technology (IT) storage equipment at PNSY, including all existing production NetApp filers and associated disks and hardware which contain all of the electronic data for shipyard operations. Supports the legacy network (SYLAN), Global Maintenance Application Suite (GMAS), and Secured Network (SECNET).\n\n[P40A \/ PORTAL CRANE, 60 TON, MODERNIZATION]: Modernization\/Service Life Extension project for one PNSY 60 ton portal crane. This service life extension is being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurement.  Existing portal crane is beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution. Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts). Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive. New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements. Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines. Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ WINDOWS SERVER TECHNICAL REFRESH]: This project supports the planned tech refresh of end-of-life (EOL) Windows servers on the legacy network (CMDNET) at PSNS & IMF.  This will result in the procurement and implementation of a suite of virtual software and hardware infrastructure to conform to the DONCIO directive to virtualize all systems by the end of 2017.\n\n[P40A \/ DIESEL GENERATORS, EMERGENCY]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at PHNS&IMF in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster. Failure to procure a temporary generator sets will leave the submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ MODERNIZE 60 TON PORTAL CRANES]: Modernization\/Service Life Extension project for PSNS&IMF 60 ton portal cranes. These service life extensions are being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution. Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).\n\n[P40A \/ EMERGENCY DIESEL GENERATORS]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at NNSY in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster. Failure to procure a temporary generator sets will leave the submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ 25 TON PORTAL CRANE - IMF BANGOR]: This project procures a new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal crane for PSNS&IMF, IMF Bangor site delta pier. This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the IMF that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands.\n\n[P40A \/ DRY DOCK #1 DEFUELING COMPLEX]: This project funds a defueling complex located at PNSY Dry Dock #1. The project will support Fleet's need for simultaneous Virginia Class Depot level maintenance availabilities and concurrent Los Angeles Class inactivations. The complex footprint consists of portable enclosures and services: Two M140 container service and rail car enclosures, an access control enclosure, Dockside Refueling Enclosure, a series of passageways, ventilation equipment, electrical services, fire alarm, and crane services.\n\n[P40A \/ DRY DOCK #2 MATERIAL HIGHWAY]: This is a design-build project for a VIRGINIA Class material handling system (Material Highway (MH)) consisting of equipment platforms, enclosures with pneumatic hoists and manual davit hoist, bridges, carts, manual pallet trucks, Vertical Reciprocating Conveyors (VRCs), and support towers for Dry Dock 2 (DD2) at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY).\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA Class Vertical Launch System Platform]: This project provides a safe means to perform VIRGINIA Class Vertical Launch System (VLS) work at NNSY. All VLS related work requires a VLS Platform to be installed. This is particularly true for any waterborne work as the VLS bathtub area cannot be safely staged in the water. A VLS Platform is typically installed as soon as the ship arrives for an availability to support equipment offload and is then reinstalled shortly after Undocking and typically remains installed through the remainder of the availability up until Fast Cruise.  Without this investment NNSY will be unable to meet maintenance requirements for future Virginia Class availabilities.\n\n[P40A \/ Hydraulic Component Test System]: This project provides PHNS&IMF a new hydraulic testing system that tests valves, actuators, pressure regulators, accumulators and other miscellaneous hydraulic components. The Entwistle testing system currently used is over 10 years old and past its useful life period. The Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU) and Cooling Tower are corroded and flaking due to being outside on a concrete slab and exposed to Hawaii's environment.  Recently, one of the HPU's doors rusted off. Due to the condition of the equipment, it had an average breakdown rate of 4 times per year through 2015.  Since then, breakdown rate has increased to 8 times per year.  This system is critically needed at PHNSY to reduce operational capacity shortfalls and breakdowns, resulting in overtime to meet schedule without being equip for future needs.\n\n[P40A \/ Dry Dock 1 Reactor Access Enclosure System and Support Structure]: This project will fund a RAE (Reactor Access Enclosure) structure and support system for PNSY DD (Dry Dock) #1. The project will support FLEET's need for simultaneous LOS ANGELES Class inactivations.  This capability will allow the shipyard to be able to service multiple reactors in the Dry Docks and meet meet the Fleets Scheduled Requirement of simultaneous inactivations starting in FY22.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA Class Bow Dome Ring]: This project procures a bow dome handling system for PHNSY and NNSY.  The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity. The bow dome handling system procurement is crucially needed at NNSY and PHNSY to perform mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ 7000 Gallon Waste Water Collection Tanks]: Required by PHNS&IMF to store and dispose of radiological waste liquids collected during depot maintenance evolutions.  Existing tanks are beyond operable service life and rehabilitation costs exceed new procurement cost.  Procurement will reduce maintenance costs and radiological risk\/exposure to personnel.\n\n[P40A \/ Portable Paint Room]: This project procures a new portable, cross draft ventilated 50' x 50' x 22' paint enclosure for PNSY to support painting operations during submarine depot availabilities.  The current paint room is part of an old building that's scheduled for demolition.  This capability crucially needed at PNSY in order to be able to overhaul submarines.\n\n[P40A \/ Relief Valve Test Platform]: A Relief Valve Test Platform (RVTP) is required to support all SSBN\/SSGN 726 Class availabilities at IMF, Bangor and PSNS.  The RVTP is placed directly on the submarine's turtleback and it provides the enclosures, structure, and platforms necessary to support piping installations, safe radiological work areas, and placement of a large liquid waste (RLW) tank to perform the test while the submarine is waterborne.  The proposed work enclosure will provide a working surface to support piping and the RLW tank as well as provide a rigid steel framed weather enclosure for all work areas.  This will be replacing the current platform which only supports and encloses the piping portion of the system, and requires use of temporary staging and shrink-wrap to enclose the RLW tank.\n\nSSBN\/SSGN 726 Class Relief valve testing is critical path work.  The existing RVTP has been in use for ten years, is at the end of its useful life, and has multiple safety and design deficiencies.  Current nuclear standards have placed the shipyard's existing RVTP out of compliance.  Required modifications to keep it operational have resulted in an RVTP not optimized for its mission.  Therefore this equipment has become a critical path scheduling concern.  A new RVTP will comply with nuclear standards, reduce critical path impact, improve operational safety, reduce labor, and optimize test functionality.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA Class Sail Racetrack Platform]: The project procures a VIRGINIA Class Sail \"Racetrack\" for NNSY.  This is a work platform that is installed around the top of the Sail with a crane that allows personnel access to safely work Masts, UMMs, Sail Access Plates, etc. on the upper section of the Sail.  This platform is mandatory for NNSY to complete sail restoration and maintenance on Virginia Class submarines.\n\n[P40A \/ Pure Water Delivery Trailer]: This is a turnkey project to procure two (2) Pure Water delivery Trailers (PWTs) for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY).  PWTs are 6,000 gallon stainless steel tanks integrated onto double axle semi-trailers with water fill\/delivery piping and water delivery pump that meet the stringent cleanliness requirements for nuclear powered ships and submarines.  This project will provide replacement PWTs for 29 year old PWT #19 and 21 year old PWT #4.\n\nPWT #4 and PWT #19 must be replaced due to being more than 10 years past their useful service life, unreliable, costly to maintain, and exhibiting corrosion stress cracking. In 2015, PWT #19 was deemed un-repairable and put out-of-service earlier than expected due to cracks on the vent piping. PWTs are required for PHNSY to maintain its nuclear license and are required for PHNSY to be a full service shipyard for nuclear powered ships and submarines.  Failure to execute this project will result in the PHNSY operating increasingly unreliable PWTs and increased probability PW deliveries will be delayed, potentially delaying submarine deployment, maintenance, and testing.\n\n[P40A \/ Reactor Access Enclosure Training Base Design]: This project funds the design deliverable for a RAE (Radiological Access Enclosure) Training Base located at PNSY Dry Dock #1. The project will support the Fleet's need for simultaneous submarine inactivations at PNSY. The RAE footprint consists of a structural storage base a passageway, electrical services, communications and fire alarms.  Without this capability, the shipyard will only be able to train to service reactors in one dry dock, failing to meet the Fleet schedule and training requirements for simultaneous inactivations starting in 2022.\n\n[P40A \/ Modernize 60 Ton Portal Cranes - PSNS&IMF]: Modernization\/Service Life Extension project for two PNS&IMF 60 ton portal cranes.  These $3M service life extensions are being performed instead of $30M (each) new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA Class VIRGINIA Payload Tube (VPT) Platform]: This project provides a safe means to perform VIRGINIA Class VPT maintenance at NNSY.  All VPT-related work requires a VPT Platform to be installed. This is particularly true for any waterborne work as the VPT bathtub area cannot be safely staged in the water. A VPT Platform is typically installed as soon as the ship arrives for an availability to support equipment offload and is then reinstalled shortly after Undocking and typically remains installed through the remainder of the availability up until Fast Cruise.  Without this investment, NNSY will be unable to meet VIRGINIA Class maintenance requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ Submarine Maintenance Enclosure]: Required by PHNS&IMF to support concurrent VIRGINIA Class dry dock availabilities.  This project provides a set of three partially enclosed towers and connecting roof that will be used individually or in combination to support Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tile repair, hull inspection, sonar dome repair, hull penetration repair, submarine access, equipment mounting and collectively to support VIRGINIA Class propulsor\/shaft replacement.  If this project is not funded in FY18, PHNS&IMF will face difficulty in meeting VIRGINIA Class overhaul completion dates within projected costs due to inefficient existing practice of using scaffolding, makeshift platforms & herculite. Simultaneous VIRGINIA Class availabilities are scheduled beginning in FY20.\n\n[P40A \/ PNSY Pump Test Station Modernization]: The B300 pump test station is used to perform shop testing for non-nuclear submarine pump & motor units for a wide range of pump sizes; 1.5\" inlet diameter to 20\" inlet diameter.  The testing ensures satisfactory operation of Shipyard overhauled pumps and motor units as well as those provided by the Advanced Equipment Repair Program (AERP).  This project will fund the replacement\/upgrade of the pump test station electrical system which consists of the motor control centers, test station control consoles, and test station power outlets, as well as replace outdated flow meters.\n\nThe current pump test station was designed in 1980. The system is old and unreliable and replacement parts are obsolete and difficult to obtain.  The system is not in compliance with today's electrical code (NEC) and an electrical safety risk.\n\n[P40A \/ Emergency Diesel Generators]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at NNSY, PHNS&IMF, and PNSY in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster.  These generators are crucial when precluding submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards to be vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ 25 Ton Portal Cranes]: This project procures two new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal cranes for PSNS&IMF, Bremerton (Shipyard site).  This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the Shipyard that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands. This crane is designed to fill a critical capability gap for pier and dry dock support, with appropriate capacity, hook height and reach for carrier support, general lower capacity pier and drydock support, for the In-activation, Recycling and Disposal program. Continued reliance on existing crane population will continue exposure to increasing costs to customer due to lack of support causing delays to the projects, increasing costs to maintain, support, and operate rental\/lease cranes, and increasing costs and lower efficiency using higher capacity portal cranes to lift lighter, repetitive loads.\n\n[P40A \/ VIRGINIA Class Propulsor Handling System]: This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs), and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities. Without this procurement, PHNS&IMF will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance.  This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions. PHNS&IMF cannot support mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements without this equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ Modernize 60 Ton Portal Crane - NNSY]: Modernization\/Service Life Extension project for one NNSY 60 ton portal crane.  This $2M service life extension is being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurement.  Existing portal crane is beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ Seawater Acid Flush System]: This project procures a submarine Seawater Acid Flush System used for chemically cleaning copper-nickel alloy seawater cooling systems and components. Without this portable acid flush system, PHNSY will continue to perform mechanical cleanings of fouled seawater cooling systems, continuing to place availability schedules at risk when fouling conditions are found as well as eliminating an unobtrusive, rapid defouling option when emergent seawater system fouling conditions occur, typically in warm water conditions. This acid flush system is the only method available to complete any emergent SW system cleanings on operational submarines. The only other method of system cleaning is during a depot availability, requiring affected components, tubing, and piping to be entirely removed, hydro-blasted, inspected, and reinstalled.\n\n[P40A \/ Submarine Camel System]: This project procures one set of universal submarine camels (2 camels) to berth subs at NNSY piers.  The proposed camel measures about 36' along the pier, 18' from pier to submarine hull, and 18' top to bottom. The camel features composite panels, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) rubber rub strips, arch fenders, lifting bars, cleats, non-slip surface coating, concrete and steel ballast.  Without this camel system, NNSY will be unable to support scheduled VIRGINIA Class maintenance assignments.\n\n[P40A \/ CNC Shaft Lathe]: This project procures a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) shaft lathe required by PNSY to support submarine shaft maintenance as well as to perform refurbishment to rotatable pool CVN and submarine shafts.  This project replaces the 70 ft. Betts Lathe and the RDD Shaft Lathe with a new 80 ton, 80 foot center-center CNC Shaft Lathe. The new CNC shaft lathe will have milling and grinding capabilities, which the current asset does not. It will also be capable of moving the carriage from end to end without removing the shaft or steady rests. This feature allows the new CNC Shaft lathe to accomplish sleeve chamfering that is not readily allowed on other shaft lathes.  \n\nThe existing shaft lathes to be replaced and undersized, outdated, and beyond economical repair. These assets can no longer provide the required dimensional accuracy for shafting processes and is currently used only for stripping fiberglass and coatings. The assets are operating at the upper limits of their capacity when machining 50 ton propulsion shafts. Completion falls inside the critical path for these evolutions. This project is required to maintain core capabilities and meet projected workload.\n\n[P40A \/ Defueling Complex - Design]: This project funds development of the deliverable design package consisting of engineered drawings and all technical criteria for procurement of a Multi-Class Submarine Defueling Complex for PSNS&IMF Dry Dock 2 (DD2).  The complex consists of two M-140 Enclosures with cranes, one Radiological Access Enclosure (RAE) with a crane, one RAE Annex, several Support Enclosures also with cranes, a Change Enclosure, radiological ventilation, and process support equipment.\n\nAge of existing defueling equipment this procurement will recapitalize is 27 - 45 years.  This equipment requires frequent repairs between uses, workarounds during use, and are personnel safety risks.  Execution of the new design, when completed, will improve efficiencies during submarine defueling operations, reducing schedule and avoiding workaround, repair, and rework costs.\n\n[P40A \/ Dual Media Discharge Enclosures - NNSY]: Dual Media Discharge (DMD) Enclosures are large structures that enable safe and controlled discharge of radioactive Media for nuclear systems maintenance. This system will be made up of stackable connex boxes. The system will support all submarine classes at NNSY and TRIDENT Refit Facility (TRF) Kings Bay (KB).\n\nThe existing DMD enclosure at NNSY is 29 years old. The tower assembley used at the NRMD was turned over from Trident Refit Facility Kings Bay in 2007 and is reaching its end of life. Existing equipment has trouble maintaining environmental controls. During rain storms NNSY has experienced leaking inside the enclosure due to rusted and deteriorating external walls and sealing components.  This equipment is a critical need of the shipyards and TRF KB in order to collect radioactive media and have the ability to perform assigned maintenance responsibilities.\n\n[P40A \/ Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor]: This project replaces the existing 23 year old four-ton capacity Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor (VRC) installed in Dry Dock 04 at PSNSY. The new VRC will be designed to be submersible and therefore can remain in dock while flooding operations occur, significantly lowering VRC operating costs. The shipyard currently must execute workarounds due to increasing, significant downtime of the existing VRC, increasing costs due to use of a constrained Portal Crane population to move relatively light loads to support dry dock operations and increasing exposure to potentially unsafe work conditions. This is particularly germane given the anticipated increased in workload at this dry dock.\n\n[P40A \/ Dual Media Discharge Complex]: The Dual Media Discharge (DMD) Complex is an integrated assembly of portable enclosures used for higher-risk off-hull effluent collection work on OHIO Class submarines.  A new DMD Complex is required to replace the 25-year old DMD Complex at IMF Bangor, which has exceeded its design service life.  The new Bangor DMD Complex consists of a Control Point Enclosure (to control access and support remote monitoring of critical work), a Portable Radioactive Waste Collection (PRWC) Tank Enclosure (provides weather protection for the PRWC Tank and discharge hose), and a Modular Tower that houses the Low Pressure Resin Catch (LPRC) Tank and required liquid transfer equipment.  The modular tower supports access to the submarine and provides weather protection for the LPRC Tank, discharge hose and associated equipment.  The DMD complex is equipped with service air, lights, heating and cooling, fire alarm system, adjustable work platforms to install and monitor equipment, permanent shielding, and stairs to reach the various levels of the complex.\n\nNOTE that this project recapitalizes the entire DMD Complex, where NNSY's comparable project only recapitalizes the DMD enclosures (modular towers without the LPRC tank).\n\n[P40A \/ Modify M-140 Enclosures- Design]: This project funds the design deliverable package that will define the modifications necessary to simplify fuel transfer operations in existing PSNS&IMF M-140 defueling enclosures.  The modifications will increase hook height 4 feet to eliminate the cumbersome process of connecting and disconnecting fuel handling tool columns.  Additional upgrades include:  seismic survivability, ventilation, lighting, a new tool column rack (to hold the connected tool columns), a new rigging platform (to reach the tool columns for attachment of rigging gear), new lower work level floor mods, and a stairwell to reach each work level given its new change in height.\n\nRefueling of TRIDENT and LOS ANGELES class reactor plants involves using two tool column extensions that couple together to lower fuel out the refueling container into an M-140 shipping container.  The tool columns are suspended by a crane inside of the structure.  The Shipyard's existing M-140 Enclosures do not have sufficient crane hook height to allow the two tool column extensions to remain connected between uses.  With the current shorter design of the M-140 enclosures, for each fuel transfer cycle, the fuel cell must be partially lowered into the M-140 container then have the second tool column extension lifted into place and coupled to the first section to complete the discharge into the M-140 container.  This operation adds approximately one to 1-1\/2 hours to each fuel cell being transferred.  The added time and the added operations increase the radiation exposure of personnel, increase the potential for radiological problems, and increase wear on refueling equipment and possible equipment problems during the fuel transfer cycle.  This re-design increases hook height so that the tool column extensions can remain coupled together during fuel transfer operations in the M-140 enclosures.  This re-design will also include all seismic requirements.\n\n[P40A \/ 2,000 Ton Press Brake]: This project is to procure a 2,000 ton Computer Numerical Control (CNC) hydraulic press brake for the PSNS&IMF Shipfitter Shop.  The existing machine, installed over 20 years ago, is obsolete, unsupported by the OEM, unreliable, and is currently down.  This reduced reliability and extended downtime has resulted in shop production schedule delays.  In many cases, there are no approved alternate methods for fabrication of the structural components.\n\n[P40A \/ NETWORK DATA STORAGE CLUSTER]: This project provides automatically switched redundancy and additional network storage for PNSY's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Network (NNPPNet or SECNET) and the Corporate Emergency Control Center (CECC).  This added system capability to switch over automatically upon failure of the primary system in Bldg 170\/6 will allow the CECC to remain fully functional in an emergency situation and also allow the NNPPNet to continue to operate uninterrupted.  The existing Network Storage System devices does not provide redundancy to CECC in the event of the loss of connectivity to Bldg 170\/6.  The existing assets provide connectivity to critical Information Systems that are accessed by the Nuclear Engineering Department, NRRO office, Business office, Engineering Supply, RADCON, SOMS, Project Teams and Administration.  Loss of access to this data due to equipment failure would cause NNPPNet (SECNET) to become unavailable to the work force and impede shipyard productivity.\n\n[P40A \/ Local Traffic Manager]: This project supports a technology refresh of the PNSY's web application environment with the procurement and installation of four (4) Local Traffic Manager (LTM) switches.  These Local Traffic Manager (LTM) switches are integral to the Shipyard's web application architecture; they provide the required functionality of load-balancing, Transport Layer Security (TLS) acceleration and offloading, online maintenance without denial of service, and FIPS 140-2 (TLS) and Common Criteria security.  FIPS 140-2 is required by Navy policy and DoD Directive 8502.2. \n\nThe replacement of LTM switches is mandatory for vendor-supported security updates and configurations required by DoD, DoN, and NETWARCOM.  End of support for our existing LTM switches will prevent compliance with DoD, DoN, and NWC directives.  The inability to meet security requirements will open the shipyard to vulnerabilities.  In addition, lack of compliance could jeopardize or cause termination of our network accreditation. The new LTM operating system will support all current IAVA and CTO requirements in support of maintaining Cyber Secure network.\n\n[P40A \/ Horizontal Boring Mill]: This project procures a 5-axis horizontal boring mill that will replace a 24 year old boring mill that is severly worn, has exceeded maximum reasonable service life, only has a 4-axis capacity, and frequently breaks down for repairs.  Due to the age, replacement parts have become increasingly more difficult to obtain, which adds to the downtime. Reliability and accuracy is poor and extra care and time are required to even perform simple machining operations.  Many shop projects require 5-axis capability and the only 5-axis boring mill at PHNSY&IMF is 12 year old boring mill that is also beyond it's service life and frequently down for repairs.\n\n[P40A \/ CRANE, TRUCK MOUNTED, 300 TON]: This project provides PHNSY a General Purpose Service (GPS) mobile crane with a nominal capacity of 300 tons. The high capacity mobile crane is needed to replace the existing high capacity mobile crane that will be 17 year old in 2018.  Expected service life for a mobile crane is 10 years.  \n\nThis high capacity mobile crane is needed to support fleet maintenance submarine and surface ship work at Naval Base Pearl Harbor.  The crane is needed to support lifting operations at Submarine Base Pearl Harbor where the shipyard does not have lifting capabilities with a portal crane.  The crane will be used to lift submarine sonar domes, submarine propellers, sail platforms, rudder staging and other high capacity or long reach lifts.  In a typical year the crane makes over 1200 lifts in support of maintenance work.\n\n[P40A \/ LATHE, TURNING CENTER, 6\"]: This project procures PNSY a Computerized Numerically Controlled (CNC) turning center with milling capabilities for the manufacture of cylindrical shaped submarine components.  Current equipment is 20 years old and is well beyond its predicted service life, mechanically worn-out, equipped with unsupportable, obsolete, numerical controls.  The original equipment manufacturer is no longer making replacement parts.  Rebuild will not alleviate the parts issue and would require an extensive one-of-a-kind CNC control interface and retrofit with little or no gained efficiency. Due to the limited capabilities and deterioration of the current 4\" turning center a large majority of the work is partially done on smaller lathes which require multiple setup times due to size constraints. The best solution is to purchase one machine with both turning and milling capability allowing the manufacture of parts requiring both types of machining operations to be done in one set-up. Hours of moving parts and machine set-up will be avoided.  This would also free up other assets and machinists in the shop for other productive work.\n\n[P40A \/ Information Technology Storage System]: This project replaces Information Technology (IT) storage equipment of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY & IMF), including all existing production NetApp filers and associated disks and hardware which contain all of the electronic data for shipyard operations. Supports the legacy network (SYLAN), Global Maintenance Application Suite (GMAS), and Secured Network (SECNET).  \n\nStorage systems five years or older are less reliable, more prone to failure, and technologically obsolete. Current storage equipment has been in use since 2012 and now experiences failures at least monthly. Design redundancy and maintenance have negated major outages thus far, but the equipment should be replaced before such an outage takes place as it would severely impact every aspect of shipyard business including financial, material ordering, ship overhaul planning, and performance analysis.\n\nThis equipment is critical for all applications and data used to overhaul submarines and for security access control at PHNSY. This includes all data on virtual servers (Windows and UNIX), Oracle\/SQL backend databases for corporate and local applications, file shares, ship drawing and instructions, SharePoint intranet web, and physical security access control IT systems.\n\n[P40A \/ Spherical Grinding Machine]: This project procures a spherical grinding machine capable of grinding valve balls between 1\" and 24\" diameter to an accuracy of 0.0001\" roundness.  This machine will be installed at PSNS&IMF, Bangor in Shop 31A's grinding room.\n\nGrinding valve balls for SEAWOLF and other class submarines is a new mission in PSNS&IMF.  SEAWOLF Class and Trident Class submarines have short availabilities, by resurfacing existing valve balls underway schedules will not be jeopardized by long lead time or back ordered valve balls.\n\n[P40A \/ High Pressure Air Compressor]: This project will purchase a universal High Pressure Air Compressor System to provide high pressure air to submarines under repair PNSY's Point Loma detachment. The high pressure air compressor system (HPAC) shall be designed and engineered to consist of a primary high pressure air compressor (HPAC) connected with a redundant compressor to provide uninterrupted HP air in the event of primary unit failure. The twin HPACs will be interconnected for redundancy, include a heat exchanger\/fan for each compressor, and supply 90 SCFM at 5000 psi. The compressors will be configured for unattended automatic operation (with remote sensing) and have self-contained membrane dehydrators. \n\nCurrently Point Loma does not have enough equipment or facilities to provide HP air to all submarines under repair at the submarine base. When a submarine's onboard HP air system is down for maintenance an alternate air source must be provided to support the ship's reactor and secondary air needs.  Currently, in order to fulfill this requirement HPACs are rented for the necessary durations for each availability.  Annual rental costs exceed acquisition cost.\n\n[P40A \/ Freeze Seal Compressor Systems]: This project procures four new freeze seal compressor systems for NNSY to provide dry compressed air for vortex freeze seal applications.  Vortex freeze seals are used to support repairs to piping, valves and\/or piping components in situations where the pipe cannot be isolated by any other means.  \n\nThese freeze seal systems support repairs on nuclear piping that is frequently internally radioactively contaminated. Failure or loss of a freeze seal while in the middle of a repair could have catastrophic consequences.  A reliable continuous supply of dry compressed air is critical to maintaining freeze seals. NNSY's existing freeze seal systems are over 25 yards old and are well past their useful life.\n\n[P40A \/ Steam Test Stand - Design]: This project funds the design deliverable that will be used to modernize NNSY's existing steam test stand.  This new design will will re-organize the shop with a more efficient workflow alignment, replace out-dated equipment and corroded pipes which contaminate test articles and violate Steam Plant Clean requirements.  The shops will realize lower operating costs, faster test setups, and shorter test start\/complete cycles and compliance.  This design will also replace existing boilers with modern, digitially controlled, high-efficiency boilers, replace all steam pipe with chrome-moly steel, install fixed manifolds for the Grade A water trailer, relocate the existing accumulator outside of the work area, install (2) dedicated relief valve test stands powered with properly sized electric steam generators, and install two large valve test stands powered by properly sized gas-fired steam generators.\n\nIt is expected that the design deliverable will require 12 months to complete after awarded, so the resulting modernization effort executing the completed design deliverable is projected for FY20.\n\nNNSY is tasked with testing steam system valves and reliefs from surface ships and subs.  The existing boilers and test stands cannot consistently provide dry steam for testing leading to seal damage and rework of valves\/reliefs.  Until this new modernization design is completed and executed, the shop will not be capable of testing the larger pumps and valves now being inducted and anticipated in the future in the required turn-around time constraints nor avoid reworks due to poor quality steam.\n\n[P40A \/ Plasma Cutting System]: This project provides a new \"State-of-the-Art\" Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) plasma cutting system for the Structural Shop in Building 155 at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & IMF (PHNSY).  The new system will have a CNC control system, water or down draft cutting table, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting torches, and be capable of cutting plates up to 10' X 20\" X 6\" thick.\n\nExisting Heath plasma cutting machine is 40 years old, obsolete, and repair parts are no longer available; therefore, this machine will not be repairable once the repair parts available at PHNSY are exhausted.  The existing ESAB plasma cutting machine is 13 years old, obsolete, difficult to operate, and repair parts are becoming difficult to obtain.  A CNC Plasma cutting machine is the most efficient machine to use for cutting thick metal plates (up to 6 inches thick) into the structural parts needed for the modifications, maintenance, and repairs for ships and submarines; therefore, the Structural Shop needs a reliable CNC plasma cutting machine to be fully functional and efficient.\n\n[P40A \/ Reactor Access Enclosure (RAE) Support Tower]: This Project will procure a \"Bridge\/Towers\" steel structure to be anchored to the floor of NNSY Dry Dock 1 and straddle a LOS ANGELES Class submarine.  The structural bridge (connecting the towers over the submarine) places the Reactor Access Enclosure (RAE), RAE Annex Enclosures and support equipment directly above the submarine.  The Bridge\/Towers structure includes a coaming to fill the space between the hull and the bottom of the RAE; and it provides landing points for service equipment and personnel access to the Ship.\n\nBy executing this project, a support structure will exist that will allow the RAE to be mounted on board a LOS ANGELES Class Submarine without supporting the weight on the hull.  Currently the RAE is physically landed on the hull of the submarine.  Extensive hull welding is required to provide the proper structural support for the weight of the RAE on the hull.  In addition the installation of the RAE on the hull requires a greater area of the hull to have the special hull treatment (SHT) tiles removed then is necessary just to support the reactor access hull cut.  The cost and time for installing and then subsequently removing the RAE from the hull is significant.  As well as the replacement cost of the SHT tiles and the work necessary to remove and reinstall the extra area covered by the RAE.\n\n[P40A \/ WINDOWS SERVER VIRTUALIZATION PHASE II]: This PSNS & IMF project procures a suite of virtual infrastructure software and hardware to further capitalize on the use of virtualization to reduce IT costs while improving upon efficiencies.  The procurement includes 35 servers and support equipment that will replace 128 existing physical servers.  Existing devices were purchased in 2006 & 2008 are well beyond the manufacturers end of life and operation capability and cybersecurity risks.  Key components of the project would include implementation of a virtual desktop infrastructure, configuration improvements, operations and monitoring improvements, and site recovery and contingency improvements.\n\n[P40A \/ UNIX SERVERS]: This project replaces NNSY's existing Corporate System (UNIX) Servers with Oracle\/Sun Microsystems T-7 series servers, along with the associated support equipment, and 12 HP DL-560 Linux Servers and associated support equipment.  The T3, T5140 and T5220 server platforms are part of the Corporate Server Datacenter Standard Architecture (CS\/DSA) and have reached End of Life, and reach their End of Service support date in 2017, increasing cybersecurity risk. The servers are required to run all mission critical and essential systems. This new equipment provides a technology refresh of critical shipyard systems.  Replacement of this system is crucial to all NNSY overhaul and repair work, as well as work performed at the other Naval Shipyards, as NNSY centrally hosts selected Corporate Systems that are used by all shipyards. The ability to meet Cyber Security regulations and requirements is necessary to maintain accreditation and preclude disconnection.\n\n[P40A \/ Switch and Router System]: This project refreshes existing switches and routers with compliant devices on the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) local Secure Network (SECNET) attached to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Network (NNPP Net).  The existing network devices have reached the manufacturer's End-of-Life\/End-of-Support threshold and are cybersecurity risks. These devices are critical components of the IT infrastructure; loss of these devices due to failure will render SECNET inoperable.  This replacement is mandatory to retain vendor support.\n\nThese assets provide connectivity to critical Information Systems that are accessed by Nuclear Engineering Department, NRRO office, Business office, Engineering Supply, RADCON, SOMS, Project Teams and Administration.  Loss of these devices would cause SECNET to become unavailable to the work force and impede the productivity of the mission to the fleet.\n\n[P40A \/ Tool Grinding Machine]: This project procures a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Grinding Machine for PSNS&IMF's Toolmaker shop to produce federal stock system tooling for active nuclear systems, and sharpen drills and cutters.  The new machine will be a CNC five-axis tool grinder with a 37 HP or greater direct drive spindle capable of handling work pieces up to 88 pounds, 9.8 inch diameter and 14.5 inches long.\n\nCNC tool grinding is an essential capability for Toolmakers to manufacture corporate tooling.  The existing CNC Tool Grinding Machine is 14 years old and experiencing increasing maintenance downtimes.  The machine has been down for maintenance at least 170 calendar days each year over the past three years and was down from July 2015 to July 2016.  The existing machine cannot meet current and future workload, nor can it reduce tooling backlog caused by machine breakdowns.  The machine does not have a coolant chiller which causes it to overheat and not function if it is worked for longer than one shift. This project increases Toolmaker capacity, productivity, and throughput required to fully support corporate tooling requirements thereby reducing Fleet wait times on Valve Seat Refurbishment kits.\n\nPSNS&IMF is the only supplier of Valves Seats Refurbishment kits for nuclear repair work.  Allowing this supply to dry up due to obsolete machinery impacts cost and safety of nuclear work throughout the Navy, including PSNS&IMF Projects in San Diego, Everett, Bangor, Bremerton, Guam, and Yokosuka.  Replacing obsolete, inaccurate machinery also impacts PSNS nuclear and PSNS&IMF nonnuclear Projects by making new process improvements more readily achievable.\n\n[P40A \/ KN400:  SHIP MAINTENANCE INVESTMENT PROGRAM]: This line item provides funding to support capital investments for the Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs) and Trident Refit Facility (TRF) Kings Bay (KB).

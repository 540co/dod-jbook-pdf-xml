            "val": "This program supports the Army Modernization priorities (Build a More Lethal Force) through enhancement of Joint Lethality in contested environments by minimizing and eliminating erosion of close combat capability relative to peer competitors in complex terrain as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (NDS).The M2A1 Quick Change Barrel (QCB) Kit provides enhancements for the .50 Caliber M2 Heavy Barrel Machine Gun to provide the Soldier with the ability to quickly change the barrel without the need to reset the headspace and timing and reduces the visible muzzle flash. In a dismounted role, the M2\/MK19 Machine Guns utilize the M205 Lightweight Tripod which reduces the Soldier burden by 16 pounds (32%) over the current M3 Tripod which weighs 50 pounds (including traverse and elevation mechanisms and pintle). The M205 Tripod provides integral traverse and elevation mechanisms for easier, more accurate target engagement and adjustable traverse limit stop for night time missions. The Mounted Machine Gun Optic (MMO) will provide increased accuracy by equipping Medium\/Heavy Machine Guns, including the M2\/M2A1, with a combined reflex and magnified optic to mounted CS\/CSS troops, who currently have no optic. The MMO will significantly improve target identification, target acquisition and effective engagement time at extended ranges while retaining the capability of short range, transition fire. The MK93 is the primary mount used to interface the M2\/M2A1 and MK19 with all Army vehicles and ground mounts. MK93 Improvement Kits will enhance hit performance and improve Soldier interface with optical sighting systems during on the move engagement by dampening mount movement."

            "val": "This program provided funding in the amount of $0.506 million to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), which modernized test facilities used in production testing of Communications and Electronic equipment.  It sustained Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that was technologically and economically obsolete.  Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provided increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity and cost avoidances to Army Program Managers.  Programmed funding was used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, AZ.\n\nThis program provided funding for the Army Materiel Command (AMC) Metal\/Polymer\/Plastic\/Sand Molding Three Dimensional (3D) Printing capability equipment to create an additive manufacturing capability at Joint Manufacturing Technology Center-Rock Island Arsenal to support Army Readiness requirements. This program allowed the Army to utilize a cost effective process of manufacturing to generate parts by creating them using a layer on layer technique such as 3D printing. In May of 2018, Joint Manufacturing Technology Center-Rock Island Arsenal was designated by the AMC Commanding General as the Center of Excellence (COE) for Additive Manufacturing to optimize readiness by using this process on parts that are difficult to procure."

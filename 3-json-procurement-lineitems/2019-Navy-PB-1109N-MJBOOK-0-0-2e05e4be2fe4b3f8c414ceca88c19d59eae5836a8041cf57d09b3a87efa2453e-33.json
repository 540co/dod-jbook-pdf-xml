            "val": "The modifications program funds numerous essential modifications, initiatives, and new vehicle procurements that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability, and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life-cycle management and allows the program office to develop and implement improvements, as needed, to respond to the evolving requirements of the Marine Corps and sustain the fleet.\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) - The MTVR is the Marine Corps' medium ground lift capability supporting all elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  With its 70% off-road mission profile and the addition of a highly survivable armor package, the MTVR is heavily used in contingency operations as well as missions supporting humanitarian operations.  It has a payload of 7.1 tons off-road and 15 tons on-road, a high-performance suspension, traction control, central tire inflation system, automatic transmission, and corrosion technology upgrades, to transport personnel, ammunition, bulk cargo, and\/or bulk fuel and water in a variety of environments.  The MTVR family of vehicles includes a cargo variant (both standard and extended wheel base configurations), a dump truck, a wrecker, a tractor and a HIMARS Rocket Resupply System Vehicle. This program funds numerous product improvements to the MTVR via engineering change proposals (ECPs), resulting from post-production requirements in Force Protection, Communications, on-board Situational Awareness, and improved fuel efficiency required across the Range of Military Operations, as well as addressing  product quality deficiencies and other issues that impact vehicle safety, reliability, availability and readiness.   The Requirements Capability Change to improve Fuel Efficiency for the MTVR is part of the program's forward-leaning initiatives to lower fuel consumption and extend the vehicle's cruising range, while lowering operating costs over the life of the MTVR.       \n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV) provides Warfighters multi-mission platforms capable of mitigating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats, which are currently the greatest casualty producers in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Multiple MRAP vehicle Categories (CATs) have been procured, fielded, and are now being sustained such as the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) with combat operations (OPS) in rural, mountainous, and urban terrain.  Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance. Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle. Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal. Funding includes required Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)\/subsystems and ECP\/Capability Insertion in response to an UUNS\/JUONS and Warfighter safety and survivability requirements.\n\nP-19 Replacement (P-19R) - Vehicles are replacing the obsolete A\/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle is outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment and provides rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19R may also be employed to fight structural fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.\n  \nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: Provides for various modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as for the integration of brackets and cables for warfighter systems, and for critical safety upgrades. These upgrades address issues that affect user safety, life cycle issues, obsolescence, and ultimately, life cycle cost reductions.\n\nMotor Transport Modification (MTM) - Light Tactical Family of  Vehicles (FoV) -  Modification program funds numerous essential modifications, initiatives, and new vehicle procurements that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, availability and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper sustainment and life-cycle management of the light tactical vehicle fleet and allows the program office to develop and implement improvements, as needed, to respond to the evolving requirements of the Marine Corps."

            "val": "Funding changes after FY 2018 reflect the inclusion of funding for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles previously funded in BLI 6520 and the P-19R vehicles previously funded in BLI 5006.  Funding for these programs were realigned to BLI 5050 to centralize modification funding for USMC tactical vehicles.\n\nFY 2018 Base Appropriation Request: $21.824M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $6.551M; In FY18, integration brackets and cables continue to be installed on the MTVR fleet of vehicles. Funding supports the procurement of subsystems and components that were transitioned to the Marine Corps from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capability initiative for a fuel efficient MTVR in September 2016. \n\nMotor Transport Modifications (MTM) $3.993M; Funding will provide for the implementation of the fleet service life extension initiatives, vehicles, quality deficiency resolutions, safety initiatives, transparent armor re-lamination and environmental\/state transportation mandated vehicle changes. Provides support for ECP integration to include addressing deficiencies of HMMWV vehicles due to up armoring and age degradation of the fleet, testing and fielding efforts for hosted systems i.e. C4I, weapons, and intel that use light tactical vehicles as their base transportation mode.  \n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: $11.088M; $.192M Reserve.  Funding will provide for various modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as for the integration of brackets and cables for warfighter systems, and for critical safety upgrades, including the brake corrosion ECP and the armored door lock improvements.  These upgrades address issues that affect user safety, life cycle issues, obsolescence, and ultimately, life cycle cost reductions.  \n\n\nThe FY 2019 funding request was reduced by ($.304) million to reflect the Department of Navy's effort to support the Office of Management and Budget directed reforms for Efficiency and Effectiveness that include a lean, accountable, more efficient government.\n\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation Request: $11.392M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $7.147M; In FY19, MTVR has a three-tier integration effort that will span across Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces (MEFs), Marine Augmentation Program-Kuwait (MAP-K) and the Marine Forces-Reserve (MFR), for installing brackets and cables, as well as other ECP kits, on the MTVR fleet of vehicles that will increase the survivability and safety of both vehicles and crew.  Critical ECP's are prioritized within the program and funded to maximize benefit to Marines using the vehicles; examples of ECP's include (but are not limited to) front and rear cab axle mounts required due to the addition of heavy armor; emergency egress window (EEW) to enable quick and safe crew extraction from a damaged vehicle;  and C4I integration kits to enable the plug-in use of on-board communications and situational awareness capabilities that are now required for all forward deployed vehicles.  As the MTVR fleet is the workhorse of the Operating forces, it is also the largest consumer of fuel.  A goal of 20% improvement in fuel efficiency will achieve significant cost avoidance to Operating Forces, while increasing the vehicle's crusing range and reducing the logistics footprint. The increase of $.596M from FY18 to FY19 reflects the FE Low-Rate Production of FE systems to determine best value solution for the Marine Corps' Medium Tactical Vehicles.\n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: $3.298M; $.215M Reserve.  Funding will provide for various modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as for the integration of brackets and cables for warfighter system, and for critical safety upgrades. These upgrades address issues that affect user safety, life cycle, obsolescence, and ultimately, life cycle cost reductions.  The decrease of $7.269M accounts for completion in FY18 of 500 of the 2000 door locks.\n\nP-19 Replacement: $.022M Reserve.  Funding will provide Initial Support, Training, Spares and FSRs for Reserves' vehicles.  The decrease of $32.119M from FY18 to FY19 reflects completion of vehicle procurement. Funding in FY19 and out reflects P-19R vehicles previously in BLI 5006.  \n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles: ($0.710M) Funds ECP upgrades\/modifications for the enduring MRAP vehicle requirement.  Continues ECP Upgrades and Modifications to maintain vehicle relevancy in meeting force protection threats, such as blast, rollover or water submersion events, and responding to operational needs.  The decrease of $4.442M from FY18 to FY19 is a result in the reduction of ECP upgrades and modifications.  Funding in FY19 and out reflects MRAP previously in BLI 6520.\n\nMotor Transport Modifications (MTM): $.0M; The reduction of $3.993M from FY18 to FY19 is a result of funds realigned for higher priority requirements.\n\nOCO: \nFY 2019 OCO Appropriation Request: $44.440M\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) Modification: $18.001M; OCO will fund procurement and installation of various ECP kits needed for the MTVRs located in the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Augmentation Program-Kuwait (MAP-K).  The ECP Kits include (but are not limited to) the C4ISR kits which provide cabling and bracketry for the Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P) and Counter IED Systems (CVRJ); Rear Cab Mounts, Front Cab Mounts, the Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) and the Emergency Egress Window (EEW).  These kits increase the overall survivability, safety and the Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities of the MTVR Armored Family of Vehicles.\n\nLogistics Vehicle System Replacement: (LVSR): $.519M OCO.  Will fund procurement and installation of various Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), such as brake safety, JBC-P and counter IED Systems, CVRJs needed for the LVSRs located in the MAP-K. These kits increase force protection of all LVSR variants by ensuring the vehicles have updated ECPs to increase braking capability, navigation and counter IED threats.\n\nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV): $25.920M OCO. Funds the installation of Egress kits procured in response to UUUNS 08275UC and 10215UC; MARCENT Enduring requirements.  The Egress kit increases force protection on all Cougar CAT I and CAT II variants by ensuring that vehicle occupants can safely exit the vehicle after blast, rollover or water submersion events."

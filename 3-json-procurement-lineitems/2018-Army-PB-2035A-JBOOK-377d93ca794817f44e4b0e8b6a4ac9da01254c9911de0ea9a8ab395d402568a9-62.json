            "val": "Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance System - Combined (BETSS-C) consists of mobile and semi-fixed sensors providing targeting and surveillance, Force Protection (FP), and Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (CIED) capabilities for 360 degree day and night coverage. This program provides modular and scalable sensor architecture of \"plug and play\" common components that can be tailored to meet mission specific requirements. The integrated System of Systems (SoS) will be comprised of existing sensor systems that combine to meet the aggregated requirements of stated needs from deployed forces. The BETSS-C Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program began in 2008 with an overarching Central Command (CENTCOM) Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) which was the combination of multiple JUONS. BETSS-C is a SoS comprised a combination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Battle Command; and FP sensor systems providing tactical commanders with video, images, and other data. The BETSS-C SoS is an evolving FP enterprise architecture with increasing interoperability, robust communications, and a common Command and Control (C2).  The BETSS-C program includes the following systems: Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID), Cerberus Trailers, Cerberus Scout, Force Protection Suite (FPS), Mid-Range Thermal Imagers (MRTI), Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS), Standard Ground Surveillance (SGS), Persistent Surveillance System \u2013 Ground (Heavy and Medium Platforms), and ancillary equipment.\n\nThe BETSS-C sensors are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components that are a form-fit-function replacements for the legacy sensors."

The F-15E Strike Eagle retains the basic air-to-air capability of the F-15C\/D Eagle, but adds a weapon systems operator (WSO), rear cockpit, conformal fuel tanks and advanced systems for all-weather, day\/night, all-altitude, deep penetration air-to-surface attack.\n\nProvides continued support of post production tooling storage at Granite City, IL. This equipment is used for the manufacture, test, support, or repair of the F-15 aircraft and\/or its associated system components. The retention of Special Tooling\/Special Test Equipment (ST\/STE) is based on past usage history, current spare\/repair parts contracts, and projections for future requirements.\n\nFunding may be used to resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources\/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and\/or obsolescence issues. DMSMS activities may include, but are not limited to, bridge buys, life of type buys, buys to protect production schedule, and minor engineering efforts for redesign.\nDMSMS costs are included in Group B NRE; SE\/PM costs are include in the Group B recurring; and Depot Costs are included in the Support Equipment."

JCSE's Modernization Program is structured around Combatant Command (CCMD) requirements using emerging technologies. Services formally influence JCSE's acquisition plan through semi-annual program reviews and make recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid.\n\nThis line funds the Department of the Navy's portion of the JCSE Program.  This program is jointly funded by Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in support of Joint Tactical Force and Joint Special Operations Task Force Headquarters."

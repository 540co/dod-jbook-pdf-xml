            "val": "The requirement for the RQ-21A BLACKJACK (formerly known as The Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS)) Unmanned Aircraft System is defined in Capability Development Document, dated 18 November 2008 and further defined in the Capability Production Document, dated 15 February 2013.  The RQ-21A BLACKJACK program entered the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition process as an Acquisition Category III program on 26 July 2010.  On 19 August 2014, RQ-21A BLACKJACK was designated an Acquisition Category II program.\n\nThe RQ-21A BLACKJACK is a combined United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) program that provides persistent maritime and land-based tactical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance\/Target Acquisition support for tactical level maneuver decisions and unit level force defense\/force protection for Naval amphibious assault ships (multi-ship classes) and Navy and Marine land forces. This system will support Naval Missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and provide support for Naval Units operating from sea\/shore in Overseas Contingency Operations. This submission is the USNs portion of the program and has been coordinated with the USMC budget submission PE 0305239M (RQ-21A).\n\nThe RQ-21A BLACKJACK system will continue to evolve and upgrade capabilities to satisfy capabilities shortfalls, new requirements, and reliability, maintainability and safety issues.  Upgraded capabilities may include Navy Command and Control integration, Weapons integration, Heavy Fuel Engine, Laser Designator, Frequency Agile Communications Relay, Digital Common Data Link, and cyclic refresh of the Electro-Optical\/Infrared camera.  RQ-21A BLACKJACK will also continue to expand its shipboard capability across new ship classes. \n\nCurrent inventory of RQ-21 systems has been satisfied. Therefore, after FY17 there are no future procurements planned.  The USMC continues RQ-21 procurement in FY18."

            "val": "1U030: Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an international maritime Very High Frequency (VHF) communication system that allows ships to exchange information (machine to machine) on navigation (position, course, speed, etc), ship information (ship name, call sign, length\/beam), cargo information (draft, type, destination, route, estimated time of arrival), and messaging (safety, text).  This technology improves capability in three diverse areas: (a) situational awareness\/common operational picture, (b) navigation\/safety of ship and, (c) other intelligence gathering\/correlation.  AIS will procure Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) AIS gear and install them on Navy warships.  This provides the fleet with an operating capability to send unclassified data to the Maritime Operations Center (MOC).  AIS provides an integrated AIS capability on force level United States (US) surface warships and submarines, including interfaces with ship's Global Command and Control System-Maritime\/Common Operational Picture, and combat systems as defined by fleet requirements and concept of operations. The program provides Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) AIS Sensor Server equipment to the MOC for publishing AIS data to the MDA Data Sharing Community of Interest.  Funds will procure and install AIS systems for ships, submarines and shore sites consisting of a combination of modified COTS and government\/commercial software, such as omni-directional VHF, Global Positioning System antennas, AIS transponders, displays and associated cables, servers, power supplies, laptop computers, junction boxes, switches and radio frequency couplers."

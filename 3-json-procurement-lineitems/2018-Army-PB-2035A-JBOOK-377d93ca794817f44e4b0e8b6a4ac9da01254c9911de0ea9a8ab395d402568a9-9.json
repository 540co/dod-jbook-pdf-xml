The SMART-T provides a robust, protected satellite capability to permit uninterrupted communications, as our advancing forces move beyond the line-of-sight of terrestrial systems.  The prime mover is a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) configured with all of the electronics and a self-erected antenna.  SMART-T provides the only low probability of interception and low probability of detection (LPI\/LPD) capability to avoid being targeted for destruction, jamming or eavesdropping.  Additionally, SMART-T provides fully interoperable communications with the Milstar terminals of other services (Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and other DoD agencies and activities). SMART-T terminals have been upgraded to use the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite constellation, which provides a four-fold increase in communication capacity over the current Milstar system, but retains full backward compatibility with the Milstar satellites.  SMART-T is designated as a DoD Space Program.\n\nThe Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 324 terminals plus 8 terminals procured for the DoD Special Users."

It will also enable WIN-T Network Operations (NETOPS) to rapidly reconfigure and route priority traffic to mitigate effects of jamming on the vulnerable WIN-T transmission paths for all nodes.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

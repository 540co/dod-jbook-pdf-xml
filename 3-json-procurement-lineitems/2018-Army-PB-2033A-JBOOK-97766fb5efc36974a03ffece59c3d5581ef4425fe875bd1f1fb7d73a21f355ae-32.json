            "val": "The M119A3 Towed Howitzer provides direct fire support for the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). Funding in the M119 Modifications budget supports the application of modernization system enhancements and includes the integration of digital fire control components previously type classified on other weapons.  The Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) includes an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU), Fire Control Computer, Gunner's Display, Power Supply, and the associated cables and brackets to mount the system on the M119A2Howitzer. The digitized M119 Howitzer will be capable of firing precision fuzes that may be developed in the future, which will enhance the accuracy of conventional 105mm ammunition. Other modifications to the howitzer include: a Recoil System Capability Package which will enhance survivability by replacing the Buffer and Recuperator in the recoil system and add suspension modifications;  Training Devices modification products including M119A3 desktop personal computer trainer, M119A3 desktop crew trainer, and M119A3 computer based trainer;   Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification which will ensure a robust Global Positioning System (GPS) capability within the digital fire control system of the M119 howitzer; and radio modification which will provide for the integration of a new Army software defined radio into the digital fire control system of M119 howitzer. Modifications will be retrofit on current howitzer fleet and program management support to the M119A3 Howitzer will be provided."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $12.678 million supports the retrofit and composite fielding activities of previously purchased Recoil System Capability Package, Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) and Training Devices.  The previously purchased Recoil System Capability enhances the durability of the howitzer and addresses deficiencies in the legacy recoil system.  The DFCS enhances system survivability and lethality through the ability to make tactical moves and acquire targets at a significantly higher rate than an optical fire control equipped weapon.  The Training Devices modification provides for Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) products for use in training artillerymen and maintainers in the field and at school houses.  These products will greatly increase proficiency, safety and mission fire accuracy and are supported by the Army user community.\n\n \"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

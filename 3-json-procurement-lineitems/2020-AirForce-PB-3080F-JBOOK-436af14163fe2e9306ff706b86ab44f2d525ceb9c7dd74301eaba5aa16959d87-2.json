            "val": "FY20 funding procures, but is not limited to, vehicles and communications\/information technology equipment in support of CAP Emergency Services,  Cadet and Aerospace Education programs that encourage and develop the voluntary contribution of private citizens to the public welfare.\n\nVehicle type and quantities, or communications\/information technology equipment, may change in execution year due to market availability, cost changes, mission requirements, additional funding, and needs of the organization.  CAP generally receives a mark-up in execution year funds from Congress.\n\nCAP provides critical communication and transportation for ground teams who support 90% of the Air Force's search and rescue (SAR) missions in accordance with the National SAR Plan and disaster relief activities.  Vehicles also provide transportation for over 24,000 CAP cadets to support execution of the Aerospace Education and Cadet Program missions as directed by 36 U.S.C Section 403, 10 U.S.C. Section 9442.\n\nAF central procurement processes are not applicable."

The analog launchers are non-repairable, yet durable enough to withstand at least 16 rocket firings per tube before being discarded.  The empty weight of the M260 analog launcher is approximately 35 pounds and the empty weight of the M261 analog launcher is approximately 82 pounds.  The analog launcher permits fuze-timing selections from the cockpit and will launch rockets using either the MK40 or the MK66 motors. 2.75 Inch Rocket Launcher procurement funding supports the launcher system to include resolution of obsolescence, safety, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, and production issues."

Procurement replaces disposable launchers as a result of annual rocket firings for pre-deployment training, and replenishes the limited issuable stockage that has been depleted below levels acceptable to support training of Active Army, Special Operations Forces and Reserve Components usage.\n\nThe demand for the M260 analog launchers has decreased due to the Aviation Restructure Initiative.\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

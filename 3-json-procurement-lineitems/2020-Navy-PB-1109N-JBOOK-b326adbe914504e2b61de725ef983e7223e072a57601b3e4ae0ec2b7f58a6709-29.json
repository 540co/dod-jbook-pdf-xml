            "val": "BASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) provides all Marine Corps installations with the base area network communications infrastructure that connects the end-user to the DISA network.  BTI modernizes, sustains, upgrades and enhances the telecommunications systems infrastructure  for all Marine Corps Installations in order to meet the demands required to support the 5th Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  BTI is designed to maintain current industry standards as they relate to technological capabilities for all voice, video and data services (both wired and wireless connections) and are transported via each installation's infrastructure.  These data services include, support for but are not limited to, Enhanced 911 (E911), Video-Teleconferencing, Integrated Services Digital Network, Marine Corps Enterprise Network, Energy Monitoring Control Systems, Intrusion Detection Systems, Access Control Systems, Fire Alarm Control Networks and Fleet Training Systems.  This includes supporting systems such as optical networks, telecommunications management systems, primary power, voice mail, teleconferencing, and outside plant infrastructure.  The ongoing focus is technology refresh and standardization on DISA Unified Capabilities (UC) (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through modernization of installation infrastructure in order to maintain connection to the DISA network. This line item includes funding specified for Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) within the above details.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) is a framework of laws, policies, procedures, and technologies for the use of digital credentials, which provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in electronic communications and transactions. PKI allows secure access to IT systems. PKI has the ability to electronically sign documents, encrypt messages and documents, and to authenticate and protect web access... In compliance with DOD policy and direction, the USMC Public Key Infrastructure Program (PKI) program provides the resources, manpower and equipment (hardware and software), dedicated to the management (i.e.: generation, production, distribution, control, accounting and destruction) of keys and certificates used by public key-based security services to include NIPRNet and SIPRNet both garrison and deployed.  The PKI program operates the USMC Certificate Validation Infrastructure necessary to ensure that only authorized users and server based applications are allowed to operate on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN).  These services are required for user access to all information system components on the MCEN including network accounts, applications and web sites.  PKI must be operable in garrison and tactical\/deployed environments.  Beginning in FY20, PKI was transferred to a new procurement line item, 4645 Cyberspace Activities, in order to consolidate Marine Corps Cyberspace Procurement Activities into one LI. \n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS) is a centrally managed program to field a technology solution in support of emergency dispatch personnel that facilitates timely responses when emergency calls for service are received.  CERS provides command and coordination dispatch functions for first responders to support All-Hazard missions.  It standardizes Emergency Dispatch Centers to provide notification functions, resource management and situational awareness in order to increase efficient emergency and day-to-day first responder operations.  CERS capability is achieved through delivery of Enhanced 911 (E911) and emergency dispatch capabilities consisting of Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Fire Station Alerting (FSA) and Mobile Data Computers (MDC) for first responder's vehicles. \n  \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR) is a modern, digital, Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 Trunked radio system at all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS).   It provides the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) communications that are required to support the Consolidated Emergency Response System and First Responders (i.e. Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services) as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiative.  Specifically, the radio system provides RF coverage to BPS populated areas and roads in-between, permitting positive command and coordination between Dispatchers and First Responders and enables their ability to respond to incidents during normal, crisis, and recovery operations.  In the wake of 9\/11 and the Ft. Hood incident, DoD recognized that effective emergency communications and mutual aid support operation are key elements in providing homeland security, reducing the loss of life and the preservation of property.  Thus, the objective for the E-LMR acquisition is to bring forth a reliable interoperability wireless communication system with a limited data capability. This line item includes funding specified for Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) within the above details.\n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEER ENVIRONMENT (TE&EE) is a Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides the only Marine Corps organic, operationally relevant, MAGTF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) architecture for testing and engineering tasks. This environment is the sole organic solution in the Marine Corps for Link-16 Tactical Data Link Networks for air-to- air, ship, and shore targeting and messaging, validated at MCTSSA before Marine\/Navy use in theater. The environment also provides Marine Corps organic equipment, environments, operators, and testers for Joint Communications Exercises, Joint Interoperability Testing, and Systems of System testing. Funding supports modernization and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers. The environment is essential to operating forces support for fielded C4I systems, as well as evaluating USMC and Joint C4I systems in a controlled, repeatable, and re-configurable manner that reduces program risk and identifies significant deficiencies prior to fielding to the operating forces. More than forty Marine Corps C4I programs and systems rely on\nMCTSSA support.\n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum information operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and a comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO into Marine Corps operations.  Multiple classification levels require separate Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support each classification level in accordance with National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency standards.  This includes equipment necessary for connecting internal MCIOC IT infrastructure (voice, video, and data) with the existing Marine Corps Base Quantico support infrastructure."

            "val": "FY 2018 Justifications: $36.114M\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $26.152M:\n\n$3.369M will support DPRI. FY18 funding is required to install base telecommunications infrastructure for two Japanese funded MILCON projects in Guam. These projects will establish a non-live fire training area in Andersen South and a waterfront headquarters facility in Apra Harbor. The Andersen South training facility will provide Marines with the ability to maintain readiness by conducting convoys, military operations on urbanized terrain, and breaching. The waterfront headquarters facility is required for the mobilization and de-mobilization of cargo and personnel in\/out of Guam.  These requirements are directly related to the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  The funding decrease of $4.360M from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the alignment of the DPRI BTI installation schedule with the Guam construction schedule.\n\n$22.783M will support the technology refresh and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at two Marine Corps installations. The funding increase of $13.582M from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to the increase in the number of installations receiving the UC\/DWDM upgrade.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI):\n$0.209M funding supported the continuation of PKI hardware and software implementation across the NIPRNet and SIPRNet for both garrison and deployed networks in order to meet CYBERCOM's Tasking Order requiring the use of hardware tokens for access to networks, network resources, and secure email in accordance with DODI 8520.02 and DODI 8520.03.

Realignment of effort to new BLI 4620 in FY19 and beyond reflects USMC Program Management Office (PMO) reorganization to improve support of USMC OPFOR. \n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP):\n$0.251M Funding is for the refresh of hardware required on both the classified Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and unclassified Open Source Information System (OSIS) networks.  JWICS and OSIS are both provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) through Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA). JWICS provides MCIOC with classified network connectivity and OSIS provides MCIOC with unclassified network connectivity.  \n\n\nFY 2019 Justifications: $72.842M\n\nBeginning in FY19, MCIOP and TEEE funding has been realigned from BLI 4635 COMM & ELEC INFRASTRUCTURE SUPT, to BLI 4620, ITEMS UNDER $5 MILLION (COMM & ELEC).\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $45.720M:\n\nDPRI - $22.001M FY 2019 funding, executed by Space and Naval Warfare Center (SPAWAR), will procure, install, and accredit, Information Technology (IT) systems. The scope of the work will support the ongoing eight MILCON projects.  There are two Japanese funded MILCON projects (J-007 Waterfront HQ and J-755 Urban Combat Trng) and six U.S. funded MILCON projects (P-250 MALS Fac, P-260 Corrosion Ctrl Hangar, P-270 ACE Gym & Dining, P-295 Ordnance Ops, P-601 Aircraft Maintenance #2, and P-715 KD Ranges). The IT systems are integral to making the facilities complete and useable. All projects are vital to supporting the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.  Cost Element 1.1 funding increase of $18.632M from FY 2018 to FY 2019 is due to the alignment of the DPRI BTI installation schedule with the Guam construction schedule.\n\nUC\/DWDM - $23.719M supports the technology refresh and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at two Marine Corps installations. Modernization and upgrade of the network telecommunications infrastructure is necessary to ensure the delivery of voice, video, and data services that support the day-to-day operations of the Base, Post, and Station.  Cost Element 1.2 funding increase of $0.936M from FY 2018 to FY 2019 is due to the increased size and scope of the installations receiving the UC\/DWDM upgrade.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI):\n$.119M funding supports the continuation of PKI hardware and software implementation across the (NIPRNet and SIPRNet) for both garrison and deployed networks in order to meet CYBERCOM's Tasking Order requiring the use of hardware tokens for access to networks, network resources and secure email in accordance with DODI 8520.02 and DODI 8520.03. Funding will also be utilized to procure necessary tokens and equipment for SIPRNet Token issuance across the MCEN as well as implementation of the DOD PKI NIPRNet Enterprise Alternate Token Management System. \n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS):\n$8.391M supports technical refresh engineering of emergency dispatch systems and system hardware\/software upgrade.  Includes system release upgrades, technical refresh planning, and recurring evaluation to ensure the full scope of CERS systems perform as designed; develop engineering and technical improvements to enhance the reliability, maintainability, safety, and effectiveness of the fielded systems; and periodical verification of compatibility with other non-ERS fielded systems.  The increase from $4.709M in FY 2018 to $8.391M in FY 2019 is due to the Marine Corps' decision to allocate additional funding to the CERS program in order to support the DoD CIO's Windows 10 mandate.  The inability to comply with the DoD Windows 10 mandate could prevent the first responder's ability to communicate and respond effectively to emergency situations increasing the chance of loss of life.  \n \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR):\n$13.485M funding supports multi-band radio (MBR) technical refresh and associated fielding support as well as system hardware\/software upgrade. The increase from $3.872M in FY 2018 to $13.485M in FY 2019 due the Marine Corps' decision to allocate additional funding to the CERS program in order to support the DoD CIO Windows 10 mandate and planned tech refresh for first responder multiband radios (MBR). \n\nDPRI $5.127M funding supports DPRI Guam requirements for ELMR capability expansion from 10 GTR channels to 20 GTR channels in support of P-715 Live Fire Training Range Complex project for the planned  build-up of USMC personnel at Northwest Field to Finegayan (future MCB Guam).  It will also increase two way radio usage on the Joint Regional Marianas (JRM) ELMR System's Ritidian site and max-out the site's capacity.\n\n\nFY 2020 Justifications: $21.140M\n\nBASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) $14.897M\n\nDPRI (Cost Element 1.1), funding supports DPRI Okinawa Telecom infrastructure supporting internal and external communications. Projects include MC0508: Base Communications Building, MC0512-T: Theater, MC0512-T-E: 4 BEQs.  \n\nUnified Capabilities\/Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (Cost Element 1.2) funding will provide for the upgrade and standardization of DISA Unified Capabilities (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through UC\/DWDM modernization at one Marine Corps Installation. Modernization and upgrade of the Installation's transport infrastructure is necessary to ensure the delivery of voice, video, and data services that support the day-to-day operations of the Base, Post, and Station.  This modernized transport capability provides for the underlying infrastructure supporting transformational requirements identified in the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control strategy (i.e. migration to the cloud, modernizing the network).  These modernizations to the transport infrastructure are required to avoid severe degradation and potential loss of voice, video, and data services, jeopardizing Base operations, unit coordination and critical life safety services.\n\nFY19 to FY20 funding decreased from $45.720M to $14.897M, a $30.823M decrease due to the difference in scope and complexity of the modernization efforts, reduction in cost estimates, and construction schedule delays in Guam.\n\n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS): $1.958M\n\nTech Refresh Modernization (Cost Element 2.1) funding increased from $0.000M in FY 2019 to $1.000M in FY 2020 due to the start of technical refresh modernization. This effort provides for the modernization of the E911 system to ensure that the components in the current system do not become end of life and unsupported by the vendor. If the aging, end of life equipment is not replaced, then these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a result of not receiving cybersecurity updates which will lead to the Consolidated Emergency Response System being unable to operate which will significantly degrade the first responder's ability to respond to emergency situations in a timely manner.\n\nTech Refresh Engineering (Cost Element 2.2) funding decreased from $2.091M in FY 2019 to $0.958M in FY 2020, a $1.133M decrease, due to the planned completion of technical refresh engineering in FY 2020 as technical refresh modernization and initial hardware procurement begins in FY 2020.\n\nEngineering Change Proposal (Cost Element 2.8) funding decreased from $6.300M in FY 2019 to $0.00M in FY 2020, a $6.300M decrease, due to the completion of the mandated Windows 10 upgrade in FY 2019.   \n \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR): $4.285M\n\nSubscriber Units Multi-Band Radios (MBRs) Refresh (Cost Element 4.1) funding decreased from $6.705M in FY 2019 to $3.207M in FY 2020, a $3.498M decrease, due to the reduced MBR refresh requirement in FY 2020. Funding in this cost element supports the continued replacement of MBRs which are becoming end of life and unsupported by the vendor. If this equipment is not replaced then these antiquated end of life mobile radios would prevent USMC First Responders and Range and Training Area personnel from achieving operational mission support to protect life and property on USMC Installations.\n\nFielding Activities (Cost Element 4.6) funding decreased from $1.880M in FY 2019 to $1.045M in FY 2020, a $0.835M decrease, due to the reduction of Multi-Band Radio fielding in FY 2020.  E-LMR funding will support the fielding activities associated with the multi-band radio (MBR) technical refresh which replaced end of life mobile radios. This cost element directly supports Cost Element 4.1 \n\nEngineering Change Proposal (Cost Element 4.7) funding decreased from $4.900M in FY 2019 to $0.000M in FY 2020, a $4.900M decrease, due to planned completion of the mandated system hardware\/software upgrade in FY 2019.  \n\nE-LMR DPRI (Cost Element 4.8): $0.033M - FY20 Funding is required to procure equipment to expand the current ELMR network that supports JRM. JRM provides ELMR support for all DOD and Federal organizations on the island of Guam.    ELMR expansion is vital to supporting the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam."

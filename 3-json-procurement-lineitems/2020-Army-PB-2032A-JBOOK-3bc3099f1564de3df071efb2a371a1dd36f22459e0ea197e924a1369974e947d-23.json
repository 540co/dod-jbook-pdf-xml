            "val": "This program provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to establish, modernize, expand or replace test facilities used in production testing of missiles and missile components.  It sustains Army production test capabilities through upgrade and replacement of instrumentation and equipment that are technologically and\/or economically obsolete. Modernization of test instrumentation and equipment provides increased automation and efficiencies, improved data quality and quantity, and cost avoidance to Army Program Managers. Programmed funding will be used to upgrade or replace production test instrumentation and equipment at the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico and Redstone Test Center (RTC), Huntsville, Alabama."

            "val": "ATEC: FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.202 million support the following: At White Sands Test Center (WSTC), upgrades warhead test equipment for Missile Flight Environmental Simulator System (MFESS) Safe and Arm (S&A) Device centrifuge to enhance the existing mechanical and software capabilities of the centrifuge certification equipment located in Building 28271 at the Hazardous Test Area Facility. Also acquires new acquisition and analysis equipment, filters, amplifiers, and transducers to replace and upgrade the aging sensors and data acquisition equipment for missile and rocket system testing. At Redstone Test Center (RTC), replaces obsolete and failing vertical shock machines used to perform missile shock tests by producing shock pulses within tolerances of MIL-STD-810; maintains the capability to evaluate hardware under anticipated shock environments in an efficient manner. The majority of the instrumentation being upgraded or replaced is obsolete and has met or exceeded its economic useful life (EUL). This instrumentation is required to ensure complete and accurate test data are collected and safety and environmental hazards are minimized. Benefits of this project include increased test efficiencies and decreased costs and risks to Army Program Managers.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

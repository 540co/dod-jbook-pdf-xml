The semitrailer is a multi-axle trailer with vehicle front and rear end loading capability, 24 volt electrical system including light emitting diode (LED) lights and extensions to expand the trailer width. The semitrailer is connected to its prime mover, M983A4 Light Equipment Transporter (LET) Tractor, via a 3.5-inch king pin. The primary mission of the M870A4 is to transport engineering equipment, as well as pavers, compactors, the Hydraulic Excavator (HYEX) and dozers. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 1,858.\n\nThe M872A4 Semitrailer is a 34-ton dual purpose, break bulk container transporter. The M872A4 is a commercially-adapted semitrailer, with missions to transport a single 40-foot or two 20-foot ISO (International Organization for Standardization) containers, palletized cargo, and light combat and tactical vehicles. The AAO is 7,256.\n\nThe M172 Semitrailer Low Bed (STLB) is a 25-ton payload capacity semitrailer with a fixed goose neck, step deck and rear loading ramps. It is interoperable with a variety of truck tractors and is employed to transport construction equipment, miscellaneous equipment, disabled equipment, Class IV construction materials and logistical provisions. The AAO is 1,296. \n\nThe M871A3 Semitrailer is a 22.5-ton drop deck\/break bulk (DD\/BB) container transporter. It is a tactical, dual purpose, bulk and container transporter.

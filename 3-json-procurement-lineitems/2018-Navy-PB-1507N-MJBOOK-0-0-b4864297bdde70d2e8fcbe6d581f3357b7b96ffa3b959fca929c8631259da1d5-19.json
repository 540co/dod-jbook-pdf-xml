This line item provides funds to procure SM-2 modification kits to support the DDG 1000 program.  FY 2017 is the first year for SM-2 BLK IIIAZ procurement.\n\nFY 2017 - 2020 funding supports procurement of Standard Missile modifications to provide SM-2 BLK IIIAZ missiles for DDG 1000 Standard Missile in-service inventory requirement.  Funding includes modification kit installation in SM-2 BLK IIIA rounds.  SM-2 BLK IIIA AEGIS missiles require hardware and software changes to be compatible with the new (non-AEGIS) DDG 1000 radar, combat system, X-band link and interrupted continuous wave illumination.\n\nSM-2 ACTIVE: SM-2 Improvements will bring the SM-2 medium range missile into the family of active missiles as an active MR missile.  SM-2 Active (or SM-6 MR) provides enhanced Stream-Raid performance against numerous threats to include agile prism via target resolution in range and Doppler and missile\/target pairing logic, over-the-horizon capability for increased depth of fire, enhanced capability against electronic attack, improved firepower due to decreased dependence on illuminators, and enhanced fuzing via guidance integrated fuzing.  Effort leverages to the maximum extent existing SM-6 infrastructure and industrial manufacturing capability.  The inventory objective is 1,000 units."

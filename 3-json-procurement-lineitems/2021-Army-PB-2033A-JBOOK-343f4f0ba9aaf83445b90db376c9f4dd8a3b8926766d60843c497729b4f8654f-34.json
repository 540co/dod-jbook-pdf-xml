This program procures modification of small arms through the procurement of accessory components, kits, or maintenance work orders (MWO) for weapons ranging up to 40mm caliber. This includes but is not limited to mounting systems, tripods, bipods, rails, barrels, stocks, optics, coatings and lubrications. In addition, engineering studies will investigate modification and production issues of all small arms weapons."

            "val": "FY 2021 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.604 million supports the Active Army by procuring 1,250 M192 MWO Kits to modify fielded systems.  The M192 MWO Kit delivers a system improvement to this lightweight tripod.  Fielded in 2005, the M192 is no longer compatible with the various body armor designs fielded in recent years. The M192 MWO Kit addresses identified shortcomings in the design and provides increased height of the pintle as well as improved performance of the traversing and elevation mechanism. Funding also supports the continued fielding of the M197 MWO Kit which upgrades the existing M197 Vehicle Mounts to add a link\/spent case deflector and ammo handling system.  These upgrades provide capability improvements addressing issues that Soldiers have identified as shortcomings of the current system.  During the year of execution additional unplanned work efforts may be required to support small arms modifications as listed in the description.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

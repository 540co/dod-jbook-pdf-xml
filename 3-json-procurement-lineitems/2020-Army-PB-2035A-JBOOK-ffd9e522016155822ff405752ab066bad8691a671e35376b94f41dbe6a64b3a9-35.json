Self-deployable, the Grader is a critical enabler in the construction, maintenance and repair of roads, airfields, hardstands, drainage and site preparation for basecamps, pipeline installation and river crossings.  The Grader is diesel-engine driven, pneumatic tired, with articulated frame steering.  It is equipped with a power shift transmission, fully enclosed cab, hydraulically operated blade.The Grader program includes the Type I and the Type IA Air Droppable variant.  The Grader is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) program that is considered a Critical Dual Use (CDU) system enabling and supporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) to 881 (861 Type I & 20 Type IA); with 44 Construction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVT).  Construction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVT) - The CEVT are commercial off the shelf virtual training devices with software modifications for military unique tasks.  These simulators enable the United States Army Engineer School with the capability to more effectively train Engineer Military Occupational Skill (MOS), while reducing maintenance of actual equipment and fuel costs during traditional training.  These simulators provide the Engineer Warfighter with a multitude of training scenarios and continuous hands on training on a variety of construction equipment and in various simulated conditions.  Use of CEVT increases skills and competency in the operation of equipment."

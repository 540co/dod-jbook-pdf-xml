        "Description": {
            "val": "The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\n[P40A \/ M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters, required by 10CFR20 and the Navy's mission, are used to detect, measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors, maintenance on radioactive systems or components, testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray), research, and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally, radiation survey meters are used to search for, locate and intercept radioactive material, and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material, they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.\n\n[P40A \/ Radiological Detection System]: M2100, Radiological Detection System (RDS):  This is a basic RADIAC instrument used in Consequence Management and Occupational Safety and Health applications by all ships (U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command) and shore commands.  It is used to survey for radioactive surface contamination pursuant to nuclear plant operations or nuclear plant maintenance; following medical procedures involving radioactive isotopes; or casualties and events that release radioactivity into the environment such as after a nuclear reactor accident or the use of weapons involving nuclear devices or radioactivity.  It is also used to perform surveys for various types of radiation in order to monitor environmental conditions in areas and spaces immediately adjacent to where radioactive material is stored or used during routine operations; where nuclear plant operations occur; and where radioisotopes are used for maintenance, such as during industrial radiography operations.\n\nThe RDS consists of a control unit and a suite of probes that survey for different types of radioactivity (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Neutron).  The control unit is necessary for all applications but the four probes are used for different situations.  That means the control unit will have the highest procurement objective and the four probes will be bought in varying quantities.  The probes will be configured as a separate unit of issue and provided to customers dependent upon the intended end use.\n\nThis instrument will replace the Navy's 30-year old IM-265\/PDQ Multi-Function RADIAC control unit and its ancillary probes, of which there are several thousand control units and probes in the inventory.  The procurement will be phased over multiple years.  The RDS is being developed by the Joint Project Manager, Radiological & Nuclear Defense in order that the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force will have a Joint instrument that will enable interoperability and surge support of assets from all the components to forward deployed units.\n\n[P40A \/ M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt, on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. \n\nIn accordance with 10CFR20, dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.\n\n[P40A \/ DT-702 Card]: M2200, DT-702 Card:  The DT-702 Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) is a small metal card, a little smaller and thinner than a domino, that contains four circular slots containing different elements that are sensitive to various types of radioactivity.  The card is placed in a plastic holder so it is protected and able to be worn by personnel on a lanyard or on their clothing.  It is issued to sailors and civilians who are occupationally exposed to radiation.  This includes Navy programs such as Nuclear Propulsion, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Nuclear Weapons, Industrial Radiography and Medical.  The DT-702 provides primary dosimetry, whereby dosage accumulated on this card can be entered into the respective person's permanent medical files.  The processes associated with the DT-702 also are compliant with 10CFR20 by being approved by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which is administered by the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST).  The cards are issued to individuals and tracked by serial numbers.  The cards are periodically turned in (and another card is issued so there is no coverage gap) to have the dose extracted by an 8800 Reader.  The process by which the cards are read include several heating cycles that eventually make the receptor elements unusable, so the life of a TLD is finite -- about 100 reads -- and then they have to be replaced.  Cards are procured approximately every two to three years in order to achieve the lowest unit price available when buying in quantity.  Under the current contract the most cost effective price is achieved at no fewer than 20,000 units.\n\n[P40A \/ DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200, DT-702 Card Holder:  A plastic case into which the DT-702 card is placed for the card's protection and so it can be worn on a lanyard or on a belt.  It has four circular windows made of specific materials of various thickness to allow the proper filtration of radiation to the dosimeter elements under each of the windows.\n\n[P40A \/ Extremity Dosimeter]: M2200, Extremity Dosimeter:  An extremity dosimeter is used to measure concentrated exposure to the hands when a radiation worker is reaching into a glove box or medical personnel are performing fluoroscopy tasks.  This item is composed of three inexpensive pieces:  1) a plastic ring ($2) to wear on a finger; 2) a dosimeter ($36) that measures exposure; and 3) a cap that secures the dosimeter to the ring.  The ring is made to a specific thickness depending on the type of radiation the dosimeter is intended to measure ($3).  These items will be procured in quantities of 3,000 each.  An average unit cost for the three items is used and all 9,000 components are shown on this one Cost Element.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter:  A dosimeter designed for use during nuclear or radiological events involving high energy gamma and neutron irradiation.  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP (Military Operational Posture) III to allow the commander to manage the exposure received by members of recovery teams.  It is also used to perform triage on casualties, allowing medical personnel to effectively allocate their ministrations.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter Cases]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter Cases:  The Battlefield Dosimeter will spend much of its time aboard ships stored in Damage Control Lockers.  The instrument will also have to be shipped to and from a RADIAC Calibration Laboratory to undergo periodic calibrations.  Because allowances for the instruments on the various ship classes range from 12 on an LCS to 700 each on a CVN, cases configured to hold different quantities (25, 50, 100) will be procured to afford the necessary protection for storage and shipping while maximizing shipboard storage space efficiency.  The price shown in FYs 2015 and 2016 were for cases that hold 100 units.  Thereafter, cases in all three sizes will be procured and costs will vary.  All configurations will be shown on one Cost Element.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Personal Dosimeter]: M2200, Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD):  An electronic dosimeter that includes a real-time digital display of radiation dose being received.  These so-called secondary dosimeters are normally used in conjunction with the DT-702 primary dosimeter in order to provide the wearer with real-time radiation dose information and alarm features that aid workers in controlling their radiation exposure.  The DT-702 (Cost Element 2.1) is the Navy's approved dosimeter to record dose of record in each individual's medical record, but it is a \"passive\" device; i.e., it does not immediately display the dose being received.  Instead, the dose is stored on the card on four different elements. It must be turned in and read by a machine (the 8800 Reader), a process that takes weeks, and therefore does not indicate if the wearer is in imminent danger.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2400 - Other RADIAC]: M2400.  Other RADIAC.  The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  This Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality that they could be grouped with.\nThis Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.\n\nSupports instruments that are disparate in functionality and cannot be readily grouped into the other RADIAC Cost Codes.\n\n[P40A \/ Criticality Monitor]: M2400, Criticality Monitor:  Radiation detection system used to continuously monitor general area radiation levels and designed to detect an uncontrolled reactor criticality event.  This system is used in reactor construction and overhaul facilities to ensure compliance with 10CFR20.\n\n[P40A \/ Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard]: M2400, Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard:  Technical Repair Standard data, calibration software and initial spare parts for the Criticality Monitor.\n\n[P40A \/ Tool Contamination Monitor, Shore]: M2400, Tool Contamination Monitor:  Used to scan tools and other equipment prior to release from a radiological work area to a general work area in order to ensure the equipment did not become contaminated with radiation while being used in the radiological area.\n\n[P40A \/ Tool Contamination Monitor, Ship]: M2400, Tool Contamination Monitor Ship:  Certification that the units procured for shipboard use will meet DoD Standard 1399 for pitch and roll.\n\n[P40A \/ Spares]: M2400, Spares:  Purchase of additional quantities of existing models of RADIACs to replenish or supplement stocks of spare items due to minor increases in program allowances, minor inventory losses, or due to items being beyond economical repair.\n\n[P40A \/ M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: M2500.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.\nFixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Detector (APD) Ship Frames]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship, Frames:  Government Furnished Material (GFM) to be provided to the manufacturer of the APD Ship (IM-272\/WDQ).  This material consists of the housing and specific internal components from the IM-239\/WDQ.  The housings and identified internal components from the IM-239\/WDQ will be prepared in the depot level maintenance facility for the item and provided to the manufacturer of the IM-272\/WDQ. Use of these housings and components reduces the overall cost of the IM-272\/WDQ and avoids the cost of a ship alteration by ensuring the IM-272\/WDQ will have the same shipboard footprint as the IM-239\/WDQ.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship:  Airborne radioactivity monitoring system for use on CVNs and all submarines.   This system (IM-272\/WDQ) is a replacement for the existing IM-239\/WDQ used on all Navy nuclear ships.   The IM-272\/WDQ incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Engineering Change Proposal]: M2500, APD Ship Engineering Change Proposal (ECP):  Naval Reactors has directed an ECP be designed and incorporated that will reduce noise and vibration for the IM-272\/WDQ in order that it will meet (classified) specifications for COLUMBIA class submarines.  No further production units will be ordered until the ECP is incorporated into the design.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Data]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Data:  Upon award of the contract in September 2014, the cost of Contract Data Requirements List and Contract Line Item Number data became known.  This data includes a one-time cost for Technical Manuals in FY15.  Subsequent years include the Technical Repair Standard, drawings, and production reports with every delivery order.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Initial Spare Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship, Initial Spare Parts:  In FY17 procure initial spare parts to support fielding.  In FY18-FY20, procure parts to upgrade the initial 40 units procured in FY14 to a new acoustic standard directed by Naval Reactors.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Provisioning]: M2500, APD Ship Provisioning Conference:  The contractor hosted a Provisioning Conference.  At the Provisioning Conference, the equipment was broken down to Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SM&R) codes and maintenance philosophies were established for each part.  Prior to the conference, preliminary copies of the following items were provided:\n\n1. Provisioning Parts List\n2. APD-Ship Interim Spare Parts List\n3. Product Drawings and Associated Lists\n4. Electronic Equipment Interactive Electronic Technical Manual\n5. HM&E Equipment Technical Repair Standard (TRS) for IM-272\/WDQ RADIACMETER\n6. Detail Specification Documents (DSD) \n7. Logistics Data Product, Special Equipment Long Lead Time Items List (SELLTIL)\n8. Special Equipment Tools and Test Equipment List (SETTEL)\n9. Logistics Data Product, Special Equipment Common and Bulk Items List (SECBIL) \n10. Engineering Data for Provisioning (EDFP)\n\n[P40A \/ APD Shore]: M2500, Air Particle Detector (APD) Shore:  This system is a replacement for the existing IM-239\/WDQ designed for ships that is also currently used in radiological maintenance facilities ashore.   The APD Shore incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance, and since it does not need to be hardened for shipboard use, it will be cheaper to procure and maintain than the new IM-272\/WDQ units (Cost Element 4.2) being procured for ships.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Shore Initial Spare Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Shore, Initial Spare Parts:  Initial spare parts and Tc-99 check sources.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Sampler]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler:  Portable airborne radioactivity sampling system.  Used during radiological work or during radiological casualties to draw air across a filter paper to collect radioactive particles.  The filter paper is then evaluated using separately provided radiation detectors to determine the concentration of airborne radioactivity.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Sampler Data & Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler Data & Parts:  Technical Repair Standard, drawings, initial spare parts and First Article Test Report for the Air Particle Sampler.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor]: M2500, Tritium Monitor:  The AN\/PDR-73 Tritium Monitor is used at nuclear weapons storage facilities and research laboratories to sample the air for the presence of tritium, which is a toxic radiation hazard if inhaled. The current instrument is 30 years old and cannot be repaired due to obsolete components. At the current loss rate due to normal wear and tear there will be insufficient assets to meet operational requirements, so a replacement must be procured.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts & Training]: M2500, Tritium Monitor Initial Spare Parts Testing, Data & Training:  In FY17 procure Electro Magnetic Interference testing, Technical Manuals, and Technical Repair Standard.  In FY18 procure initial spare parts to support fielding and factory training of RADIAC Calibration Laboratory Electronic Technicians and program engineers.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment]: M2600.  This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and test facilities.  This kind of equipment is distinct enough to warrant separating it for management purposes from the M2400 Cost Code.\n\n[P40A \/ Gamma Counter Upgrade]: M2600, Gamma Counter Upgrade:  This laboratory equipment provides the capability of detecting loose contamination and the advantage of distinguishing if there is beta or gamma radiation\/contamination present in the area.  It provides automation in both the actual counting of samples and their automatic analysis.  The upgrade is to software and hardware to improve performance and increase functionality.  The upgrade will change the detecting medium to increase the counting efficiency.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrators]: M2600, Calibrators:  Calibrators are the basic tool used to calibrate all Navy radiological detection equipment.  They consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed room, or \"range.\" A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that the radiological source becomes exposed and it irradiates the instrument. The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances. The current suite of AN\/UDM-1B calibrators is over 30 years old, and the natural decay of the strength of the radioactive source over time restricts calibration effectiveness by limiting the scale of calibration points below American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements that are followed in accordance with Navy policy. Also, due to the age of the calibrators, there are several parts no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a malfunctioning calibrator (e.g., where the source gets stuck in the exposed position) poses a very high safety risk.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrator Initial Spare Parts & Training]: M2600, Calibrator Initial Spare Parts & Training:  Initial spare parts and vendor training at each of the seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories where the equipment will be installed.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 - Support - Production Engineering]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government and contractor personnel who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering Carderock]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering ISEA]: M2830, Production Engineering In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA):  Labor cost of the contractor Engineers, Logisticians, Technical Writer, Program Analyst, and Systems Analysts who help prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code services acquisition."

            "val": "Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction to locate or intercept WMD)."

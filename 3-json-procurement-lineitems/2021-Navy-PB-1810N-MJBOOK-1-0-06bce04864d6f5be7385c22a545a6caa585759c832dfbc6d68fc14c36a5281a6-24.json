            "val": "This line item provides funding to procure Mission Planning workstations and associated Support Equipment, Software\/Production Engineering Support, and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) for the Naval Mission Planning Systems (NavMPS) family of systems, which includes the Joint Mission Planning System-Maritime (JMPS-M) (primary product), Next Generation Naval Mission Planning System (NGNMPS), JMPS-E, Electronic Kneeboard (EKB), Common Munitions Built-in-Test(BIT)\/Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), and Standardized Tester of Reprogrammable Munitions (STORM) formerly called \"Next Generation CMBRE\".\n\nJMPS-M (Maritime) is the legacy automated mission planning system for Naval Aviation, currently supporting over 40 Type\/Model\/Series (T\/M\/S), U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft and expeditionary forces.  Future manned JMPS-M platforms include: CH-53K, CMV-22B and P-8. JMPS-M enables weapon system employment by providing the information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, conduct mission rehearsal, and post mission analysis. The Navy's modern aircraft need data loaded from JMPS-M to fly their missions. \n\nNGNMPS will address critical capability gaps and deficiencies in the legacy JMPS that are required for modern 21st century integrated mission-centric and collaborative Multi-Domain Mission Management (MDMM) planning, execution and analysis in support of the National Defense Strategy. NGNMPS will replace Naval Aviation's legacy JMPS no later than 2027 while also affordably leveraging prior investments across the system of systems to deliver integrated and collaborative capability. NGNMPS will affordably address technological obsolescence while also delivering collaborative and automated capabilities in an integrated virtual collaborative data environment. NGNMPS will also leverage service-oriented architecture to provide revolutionary improvements in workflow, usability, cybersecurity, information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan\/employ\/maximize effectiveness of aircraft\/weapon\/sensor\/payload mission plans, advanced pre-mission rehearsal\/analysis, functionality to load mission data into aircraft and weapons, dynamic replanning\/retargeting against evolving threats in contested environments, integrated and advanced post-mission debrief\/analysis, cross-domain capabilities, and support for portability of mission planning, mission execution, and mission analysis functions. \n\nJMPS-E (expeditionary) is a scalable, tailorable and collaborative web-based mission planning and execution monitoring tool for Marine Expeditionary Unit and Amphibious Squadron staffs embarked with each Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG). \n\nEKB provides Naval Aviation with a scalable, rapidly deployable capability to support Department of Defense (DOD) digital transformation initiatives.  EKB is configured on a portable electronic device and contains digital flight information, aeronautical products, reference material, and flight planning tools to support aviation operations in land-based, littoral, and blue-water environments.  EKB also provides tactical mission planning and execution capabilities including tactical decision aids that support the range of Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) operations.\n\nCMBRE provides USN\/USMC forces with the critical capability to perform built-in-test (BIT) and programming\/reprogramming of various weapons afloat and ashore. CMBRE operations afloat require the modernization of ammunition Magazine Operations (MAGOPS) in all aircraft carriers (CVN-68 and CVN-78 classes) as well as large-deck L-Class (LHA\/LHD) ships to enable safe stores BIT and programming\/reprogramming in CVN magazines to support carrier air wing sortie generation requirements. The Standardized Tester of Reprogrammable Munitions (STORM) (formerly called Next Generation CMBRE) is the follow-on replacement system for the legacy CMBRE System and affordably addresses legacy CMBRE end of life obsolescence issues while also modernizing the system into an affordable lightweight, compact, modular design.  CMBRE and STORM further supports USMC expeditionary mission requirements; mandatory cybersecurity protections and resilience; data transfer speeds that are required to support air wing combat readiness and CVN sortie generation requirements, and support for advanced Net-Enabled Weapons across the enterprise that are required in support of the National Defense Strategy to pace the percentage threat. STORM will affordably enhance mission readiness and security, generate improved flexibility, depth and capacity for existing and emerging aviation weapon capabilities during the conduct of ship, shore, and ship-to-shore operations in both conventional and Disaggregated Aviation Operating (DAO) environments.\n\nAs aircraft and weapons become increasingly advanced, they will require increased access, quantity, processing analysis and fidelity of data to support mission planning, mission execution, dynamic mission re-planning and mission analysis. These data requirements will require additional advanced processors, memory, storage, and servers. Mission Planning Seats refer to the computer workstations that employ the mission planning software. Program cost is not directly related to FY hardware quantity; software is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost. Funding profile accounts for required four-year workstation refresh cycle to preclude aging\/obsolete hardware and reduce failure rates, procure supporting emerging technology such as EKB (and STORM starting in FY 2023) to support advanced operational capabilities and address system obsolescence\/cyber-security requirements\/mission readiness requirements, and support memory requirements for required mission planning capabilities.\n\nNGNMPS and STORM will utilize a Middle Tier Acquisition approach per Section 804 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), as amended in FY 2017 NDAA(codified at 10 U.S.C. sub sec 2302 note) to deliver NGNMPS and STORM capability to the Navy across multiple platforms.\n\nPrior to FY 2017, the EKB was funded in BLI 4268."

            "val": "FY 2021 provides funding to procure seven hundred fifty (750) Mission Planning Seats, five (5) Expeditionary Planning Seats, EKB, training assets, and other JMPS and NGNMPS support equipment; continues the release of software enhancements based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies, cybersecurity mandates and associated logistics support. FY 2020\/2021 laptop procurement supports the AV8B, C-130, C-2A, E-2C\/E-2D, MH-60R\/S and Navy Legacy Helicopter (NLH) platforms. This hardware is required to field critical electronic attack mission planning capabilities and support cyber security mandates which ensures air superiority and projected military force in contested areas. Updated hardware is required to continue to meet JMPS and NGNMPS operational \"Time-To-Plan\" requirements for complex platforms, which include F\/A-18 (all variants) and EA-18G. Additionally, funding provides for database and server systems with storage space capable of storing National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) world-wide map, data imagery, and intelligence data with associated network hardware. This will provide the Fleet with the required storage for map data, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED), imagery, and intelligence required to plan missions. FY 2021 continues modernization of legacy mission planning execution and analysis software and hardware for affordable integration with the NGNMPS.\n\nItems to be funded in this line include:\n\nWorkstation Components - Tactical computer hardware is procured through a non-developmental item acquisition strategy. Tactical computer equipment is used to plan and analyze expeditionary missions and aircraft routes under various mission configurations and operational threat environments. Primary outputs are tasking orders, Courses of Actions (COAs), Route Plans, Munitions \/ Weapons Plans, and Navigation and mission essential data loads for mission execution. New workstations consist of aircraft unique data transfer devices and interfaces, Memory Data Loader Receptacles (MDLR) Small Computer Standard Interface (SCSI) (MDLR-S), EKB, STORM, Ogden Data Device Ethernet Crypto (ODD-EC), Data Storage Unit Receptacle SCSI (DSUR-S), servers,  network hubs, printers, fleet training school workstations, JMPS Application Central Access Library (JACAL), training assets, and other peripheral devices for USN\/USNR\/USMC\/USMCR missions. JMPS and NGNMPS Authority to Operate (ATO) requires compliance with Naval Network Warfare Command (NNWC)-issued Information Assurance (IA) mandates and Communications Tasking Orders (CTOs).\n\nSoftware\/Production Engineering Support - The JMPS and NGNMPS programs produce software releases via evolutionary and agile development processes. These releases contain enhancements based on fleet inputs and technology challenges. They also contain changes required to retain compatibility with supported platforms, associated weapons, and threat and imagery databases providing input to JMPS-M and NGNMPS. Software releases are independent of hardware buys. This cost element includes production support services, engineering support services, independent verification and validation test and acceptance, site activation, IA compliance and quality assurance efforts.\n\nIntegrated Logistics Support - The JMPS and NGNMPS programs conduct site surveys, prepares site installation drawings and provides on-site engineering and logistics evaluations for installations and delivery systems to ensure compliance with the specified configuration. This includes the production and delivery of technical documentation and training materials such as OPNOTES, installation instructions and user manuals required during the fielding of JMPS-M and NGNMPS products. ILS is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost."

System consists of multi-channel variable depth buoys, shipboard data acquisition, control, and processing support systems. Buoys acquire the data, provide signal conditioning and gain, and store the data in digital form. \n\nACOUSTIC POSITIONING SYSTEM (ULTRA SHORT BASELINE (USBL) The Acoustic Positioning System (APS) is an Ultra Short Baseline (USBL) Acoustic Positioning System used to provide high accuracy navigation and location of towed bodies and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) deployed from T-AGS 60 oceanographic survey vessels. The APS is permanently installed aboard each vessel and supports tracking objects in any direction out to a 5000m radius. In addition, it is used to precisely locate lost vehicles or instrumentation for purposes of recovery. Current navigation techniques can be inaccurate as they rely on approximations resulting in imprecise location data and degraded environmental data. This can lead to a substantially increased processing time and increased risk of missed coverage. With the ability of APS to determine accurate location data, the cost, practicality, and search time to recover a lost vehicle is substantially reduced. \n\nDIGITAL SIDE SCAN SONAR (SHIP) Additional high-speed, high resolution side scan sonar systems are required to meet fleet requirements supporting mine warfare operations. The intended system procured will be installed aboard USNS HENSON and additional T-AGS 60 class ships to replicate the system aboard USNS HEEZEN. The procurement will facilitate simultaneous collection of high resolution imagery at mine warfare resolutions and frequencies. The imagery data is required to generate products that directly support mine warfare, hydrographic and oceanographic requirements. Side scan sonar data is critical for the detection of small mine-like targets as well as hazards-to-navigation (e.g. wrecks) and characterizing the sea-floor over large areas (geoprovincing). This data is fundamental to execute Global Mine Warfare (MIW) change-detection doctrine comparing historical data to current data to determine mine-threats.\n \nFLEET SURVEY TEAM INTEGRATED SURVEY PLATFORM Purchases transportable hydrographic survey platform systems used for rapid response, contingency, and emergent high-priority survey requirements. The platform is 7-9 meter air-transportable survey boat (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) type) with installed and fully-integrated Multibeam Echo-Sounder RESON 7125, Single Beam Echo-Sounder, Digital Side Scan Sonar, Wide-Area Differential Global Positioning System navigation, Inertial Motion sensor system, Data Acquisition Work-Station (PC), Sound Velocity Probe, and Electric winch. The boat and trailer are designed for transport in a C-130 aircraft and rigged for hoisting. \n\nHYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY LAUNCH (HSL) MISSION EQUIPMENT This line item involves the life-cycle replacement of the entire mission equipment suite currently installed aboard the operational fleet of Hydrographic Survey Launch (HSL) (seven HSLs and the Bertram). The mission equipment suite includes, but is not limited to, shallow water multibeam systems, single beam systems, navigation systems, data collection and storage systems, forward-looking sonar systems, and digital side scan systems. This does not include high-resolution digital side scan systems used for mine warfare. Life-cycle replacement of these systems is critical to ensure state-of-the-art hydrographic surveying capability in littoral areas. Also, due to the harsh environmental conditions encountered by HSLs during typical hydrographic surveys, planned replacement of their mission equipment is necessary to guarantee long-term supportability.\n \nINTEGRATED SUB-BOTTOM PROFILER The sub-bottom profiler system provides high resolution digital acoustic data that describes the physical depth and acoustic characteristics of the ocean bottom and its subsurface layers over full ocean depth. This data is used in the development of products to support Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Mine Warfare programs with tactical environmental data. The sub-bottom profiler is also used to identify suitable deployment areas for installing bottom-mounted navigational beacons supporting Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operations. These systems are life cycle replacements for existing Sub Bottom Profiler systems that have exceeded life expectancy and do not currently provide high resolution digital acoustic data with precision positioning and navigational capability that is required for Mine Warfare missions. Systems will operate in conjunction with the new deep-water multibeam systems that were installed in FY15. \n \nLONG TERM AMBIENT NOISE RECORDING AND REPORTING SYSTEM Long Term Ambient Noise Recording and Reporting System is a moored, acoustic buoy system used to support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The buoys are four channel Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS) units that will record ambient noise for long time periods within an 8kHz bandwidth. The Environmental Acoustic Recording System buoys will have to be recovered for data processing. \n\nMASTER CLOCK SYSTEMS These systems consist of: Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning systems to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls. These systems will allow for more rapid, robust and autonomous characterization of the Rubidium Fountains and Hydrogen Masers in the timing ensemble at U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO). Rb fountain clocks deliver the precise time and time interval required to support Global Positioning System (GPS) III requirements and national assets. \n \nOCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (OIS) ARCHITECTURE The Oceanographic Information System (OIS) architecture provides the corporate information technology infrastructure to enable the collection, processing, storage, archival, retrieval, and dissemination of oceanographic data, products, and other scientific information delivering Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) superiority to the Fleet. Funds life cycle support and technology refresh to upgrade the end-to-end processing and production systems. Deployment of new state-of-the-art oceanographic sensors, such as high-speed, high-resolution digital side scan sonar systems, collect data volumes far in excess of the current OIS capability to receive, process, store, and archive data. The integration of Fleet through-the-sensor data into OIS production and the collection of remotely sensed data add to the complexity of the technology infrastructure required for OIS. Upgrades to existing corporate storage resources that support the data warehouse and expand the storage area network to meet anticipated data storage requirements are included. \n\nPORTABLE MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT Portable Multibeam Sonar System is a roll-on\/roll-off life cycle replacement for the RESON 8101 (4 systems) and the RESON 8125 (1 system). These systems provide the means to rapidly deploy a multibeam capability onto a craft of opportunity in order to support emergent naval requirements. Portability is key to enable rapid response to urgent or short-fused demands. The new systems provide an increase in survey efficiency, reduced maintenance costs, and an improvement in data quality. The Portable Multibeam Sonar System that replaces the RESON 8125 will provide high-resolution swath bathymetry along with side scan sonar imaging capability. This system will provide bottom imagery to facilitate MIW route surveys and navigation hazard surveys. \n\nPRIMARY OCEAN PREDICTION SYSTEM (POPS) ENHANCEMENTS Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global Meteorological and Oceanographic Command (METOC) support of the fleet. POPS-Met operates within a 24\/7 reach back operations center supporting global fleet operations with weather and ocean prediction products and warfighting applications that are critical to fleet safety and warfighting effectiveness. POPS-Met provides the technology and infrastructure to sustain global operations ashore and afloat by providing timely, relevant, 24\/7 METOC data and products to the fleet, Department of Defense, joint, allied, and coalition warfighters at all classification levels. POPS-Met acquires and sustains the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) environments to provide most of the assured METOC forecast products and services for Tier 1 of the Battlespace on Demand, which originate directly from the METOC models, satellite processing software, and applications. Tier 1 also provides input to many of the Battlespace on Demand Tier 2 and Tier 3 Products. Ongoing technology refreshment is required to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly in response to greater emphasis on preparation for and response to regional conflicts, and the greater data volume from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and future remotely sensed environmental data sources. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support. Together, these enhancements will provide the Fleet with more accurate and responsive environmental support across all three Tiers of Battlespace on Demand. \n\nSHIP MOVING VESSEL PROFILER (MVP) The Shipboard Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) is the larger shipboard complement to the Hydrographic Survey Launch (HSL) MVP. Intended for use from T-AGS 60 platforms, the system consists of a compact and recoverable probe integrated with a computer controlled over-the-side handling system. It permits the rapid and automated acquisition of sound velocity profile data from an underway vessel and significantly increases multibeam survey efficiency by acquiring highly accurate automated sound velocity profile data in the critical 0-400m water layer.\n \nTIME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM Time is distributed via telephone, modem, Global Positioning System (GPS), Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). Funding is for distribution systems necessary to transfer and distribute time to users. This consists of receivers systems for M Code receiver systems, Two Way Satellite Time Transfer systems, Precise Time and Time Interval measuring systems, Critical Time Dissemination (CTD), NextGen Secure TWSTT, and other systems to distribute precise time. \n\nVERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY SYSTEM Systems to be purchased here are antennas, radio receivers, Radio Frequency (RF) to digital conversion systems, wide band communication systems, and correlators to process wide-band data obtained at sites separated by thousands of kilometers. Very Long Baseline Interferometry data monitors variations in the Earth's orientation and form the basis for the fundamental celestial reference frame, and supports DoD and national requirements for Space Situational Awareness. \n\nAIRBORNE LIDAR SYSTEM The Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR (CZMIL) replaces the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system. CZMIL is an aircraft mounted Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system used to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Routine life cycle replacement maintains technology refresh, precludes obsolescence of equipment and repair parts\/maintenance, and maintains survey reliability. \n\nDEEP MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT The full ocean multibeam sonar system is the primary ship-mounted ocean mapping tool used for surveys in water depths greater than 300 meters to full ocean. The deep-water multibeam system is a state-of-the-art, commercial, one-by-one degree system with a maximum swath coverage of six times water depth. The multibeam survey system includes an integrated deep water sub-bottom profiler system. The system will be installed on all T-AGS 60 class ships as a life-cycle replacement for the existing deep water multibeam system (EM121A). The deep water multibeam system (EM121A) has exceeded its life expectancy and will no longer be supported by the manufacturer. Multibeam systems collect deep-water bathymetry data required to support special chart production for the Navy. If the deep-water multibeam systems are not replaced, the T-AGS 60 ships will lose the capability to support the Navy's requirement for deep and mid-water bathymetry data products. \n\nSHALLOW WATER MULTIBEAM The shallow water multibeam sonar system is the primary sea-floor mapping system in the littoral (50-500 meters of water). Without this data: 1) surface and sub-surface littoral navigation charts would not be updated with accurate, high resolution bathymetry, 2) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running ocean (currents, waves, tides) models supporting anti-submarine warfare, naval special warfare and mine warfare applications would not be available and 3) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running acoustic models for anti-submarine warfare would not be available.\n \nSHALLOW WATER SEISMIC SYSTEM Lifecycle replacement and upgrades to seismic systems are needed to meet existing requirements for geophysical measurements in shallow to mid-depth water environments. The systems will be roll-on\/roll-off systems and consist of a sub-bottom profiler for medium to deep sub-bottom measurements. These systems are designed to meet requirements for geophysical measurements to support geophysical database construction. These databases are an essential part of acoustic prediction systems and support to Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission planning, execution, and prosecution.\n\nOPN OCO - Timing, Time Transfer and Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) OCO - Funding is associated with the European Deterrence Initiative and will support an X-band \"hop station\" on the east coast of CONUS to relay Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services from the Alternate Master Clock to the EUCOM AOR. The newly established TWSTT services will increase the robustness of the highest level timing support into EUCOM by allowing failover to the alternate authoritative timing source for the DOD.  Currently, USNO's Alternate Master Clock cannot reach the EUCOM AOR with TWSTT services. The Navy, through USNO can improve the robustness of EUCOM timing support over SATCOM channels with this one-time upgrade of satellite based timing distribution on the east coast of CONUS.  \n\nOPTSEO - Timing, Time Transfer, EOP Delivery - This conglomerate system consists of a series of high accuracy clocks and instrumentation assets that generate crucial parameters for Global Positioning System (GPS), including time and EOPs.  Included in the time generation, time transfer and EOP delivery system are Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning chambers and clean rooms to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls, a distribution amplifiers antennae and associated equipment, transceivers, GPS Monitoring, and EOP instrumentation. Tech refreshes, instrumentation upgrades, and modernization of components are crucial for maintaining time and EOP standards in accordance with CJCSI 6130.01F, which dictates USNO's responsibility to coordinate Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) requirements and to maintain a PTTI reference standard (astronomical and atomic) for use by all DoD. This is a consolidation of 1.8) Master Clock Systems and 1.15) Time Distribution System. \n\nOPCRFM - Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) Management - As Manager, per DoDI 4650.06, the USNO is responsible for the determination of the CRF and EOP for the DoD.  The celestial measurements that secure these two products are taken with high precision visible, infrared, and radio optics instrumentation.  The USNO CRF aggregate system operates roughly 20 visible, infrared, and radio telescopes across the world to meet these requirements.  Many of these systems require high performance computing assets that compile large data volumes of data and ready them for distribution to the community.  This network of instrumentation, auxiliary electronics and computing systems require regular technical refreshes, instrumentation upgrades and component modernization to provide CRF data relevant to today's DoD programs.  These include telescope component upgrades, electronics upgrades, next generation detector and camera development, cooling system facility upgrades and Software Correlator continuity of operations builds.  These activities are all required to maintain the infrastructure that provides CRF and EOP data to DoD customers in an era of new surveillance, targeting, intelligence, and reconnaissance technologies and instrumentation. This is a consolidation of 1.16) Very Long Baseline Interferometry and 1.22) Navy Precision Optical Interferometer.\n\nEUROPEAN DETERRENCE INITIATIVE Acquisition and deployment of 100+ Profiling Floats to collect depth-varying water column data to improve Navy METOC ocean models.  Acquisition of Maritime Acoustic Collection - Ocean Surveillance (MACOS) systems to collect data to build gridded bottom loss and ambient noise data bases.  Both will inform Anti-Submarine Warfare area assessment products, and provide critical environmental input to fleet acoustic Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs).  MACOS consists of an Advanced Capability Glider, hydrophone array(s), data storage and processing capability, associated oceanography information, communication hardware and software, and maintenance support systems.  Contract physical scientist(s) for data validation and verification, and processing; technician(s) for MACOS deployment, recovery and maintenance; and logistician(s) to assist with MACOS and associated equipment storage and shipping. Acquire equipment and parts necessary to refurbish and maintain MACOS systems.  Contract physical scientist(s) and\/or technician(s) for Profiling Float deployment and logistician(s) for Profiling Float storage and shipping.\n\nRigid Inflatable Boats (RIB) ISO Global Mine Warfare (MIW) Operations - Funding to support the purchase of (2) 8.5M Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs) to replace the Combat Rubber Rating Crafts (CRRCs) currently being utilized for global Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) inshore surveys. The larger RHIBs are required due to the CRRCs not being designed for offshore use thus unsafe\/unreliable in offshore maritime conditions, and severely limit maneuverability through most sea-states which is unsuitable for the majority of UUV surveys.  RHIBs are designed for offshore UUV survey requests. The RHIBs will greatly improve the ability to provide mission critical information aimed at protecting the Navy from underwater threats and support the increased naval demand in offshore operations.\n\n[P40A \/ Acoustic Measurement System]: Funding to support updated technology and capability changes. The new system will include an All-in-One underwater enclosure and anchoring system to the ocean floor.\n\n[P40A \/ Acoustic Positioning System (USBL)]: Acoustic Measurement System Lifecycle replacement and upgrade of digital acoustic measurement systems used to collect data used to build gridded data bases of layered geo acoustic descriptions of the ocean floor and low frequency bottom loss databases, collect fleet anti-submarine warfare support measurements, produce high resolution anti-submarine warfare area assessment products, and serve to provide critical environmental input to fleet acoustic transmission loss models. System consists of multi-channel variable depth buoys, shipboard data acquisition, control, and processing support systems. Buoys acquire the data, provide signal conditioning and gain, and store the data in digital form.\n\n[P40A \/ Digital Side Scan Sonar (SHIP)]: The digital side scan sonar systems are purchased as needed based on the life cycle replacement schedule for the T-AGS ships.  In FY20, two Digital Side Scan Sonar are scheduled for life cycle replacement.\n\n[P40A \/ Integrated Sub Bottom Profiler]: The Integrated Sub Bottom Profiler is purchased as needed based on the life cycle replacement schedule.  This replacement will enhance current outdated technology in the CENTCOM yard which in turn will provide high resolution digital acoustic data with precision positioning and navigational capacity for Mine Warfare mission. Increase from FY19 to FY20 is the need to procure two Sub Bottom Profilers in FY20 vice 1. In FY19, 1 Sub Bottom Profiler was procured.\n\n[P40A \/ Master Clock Systems]: The Navy's funds to support the United States Naval Observatory's (USNO) Operation Procurement, across all Cost Elements, is used for the life-cycle replacement of aging equipment.  Therefore, USNO does not buy\/replace the same equipment each year.  While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  In each year, USNO is procuring different elements of the master clock system and the cost associated with these elements varies. \n\nFY19 funding supports the procurement of another Life Cycle replacement of clock environmental chambers for temperature and humidity control and a Master Clock Measurement System which is a replacement of multi-channel backup clock measurements system to improve clock measurement precision. \n\nFY20 - Decrease is due to realignment of the cost element from Master Clock Systems to OPTSEO - Timing, Time Transfer, EOP Delivery.

Replacing the EoL\/EoS POPS-Met system components with High Performance Computing (HPC) technology, data storage requirements, and the high-speed network connections between the computing and storage components is both complicated and expensive.  New generations of HPC equipment and infrastructure components are required to meet the expanding FLENUMMETOCCEN mission and cyber security requirements.  In accordance with the POPS-Met System Integration Master Plan (SIMP), the storage, networking, and compute nodes\/memory are replaced on a four year cycle.

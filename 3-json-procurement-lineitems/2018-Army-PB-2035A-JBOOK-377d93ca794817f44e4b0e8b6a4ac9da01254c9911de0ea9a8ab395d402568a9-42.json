The IBS is the worldwide DoD standard network enterprise for transmitting time-sensitive tactical intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational Users. The JPO's role is to coordinate modernization and sustainment of IBS terminals compatible with the UHF SATCOM IBS broadcasts. The transmit\/receive-capable Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) systems satisfy the radio communication Key Performance Parameters for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers\/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through acquisition, fielding support and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment. The JPO coordinates support as needed for the new IBS network that employs new crypto, a new Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), and the Common Message Format (CMF). Funds support JTT configuration management, procurement of parts, JTT component obsolescence redesign\/engineering, JTT sustainment coordination, JTT organic hardware depot establishment and JTT fielding support."

            "val": "* Indian Financing is listed as P-1 line number 49-1 because it is not showing on the P-1 and falls under WHS.\n\nThe FY 2018 approved conference report did not include language in support of funding of $20.000 million for Indian Finance. Prior approval reprograming FY18-23 PA for Indian Financing Act did not transfer in the accounting system prior to lock for the end of the FY 2018 actuals, however funds have been received and are executing in FY 2019.\n\nThe DOD Indian Incentive Program (IIP) is authorized by Section 504 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (U.S.C 1544).  In 1989, Congress began providing annual funds through the DOD Appropriation Act for the DOD Indian Incentive Program.  The program motivates prime contractors to utilize Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises by providing a 5% rebate on subcontracted work performed by those companies that fall into the following categories:  Federally Recognized American Indian Organizations, Indian-Owned economics enterprises and small businesses owned by members of recognized tribes, Native Alaskans or Native Hawaiians.  Through the generation of subcontracts to the above mentioned entities, the IIP fulfills its purpose as an economic multiplier for Native American communities."

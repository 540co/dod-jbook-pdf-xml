            "val": "The FY 2020 - FY 2024 Joint Staff program realigns CE2T2 procurement resources to CE2T2 O&M to satisfy higher priority requirements.\n\nFY 2019 CE2T2 procurement funding is being used to support the following activities: \n\n1 . USCYBERCOM-led CYBER FLAG, CYBER GUARD, and CYBER KNIGHT exercises. The exercise environment includes a \"blue forces\" Department of Defense Information Network to include Network Operations Security Centers, a \"gray\" network of internet spaces to include .gov and .edu domains that will emulate Internet sites and user activities, a realistic representation of an adversary \"red\" network, and a management systems network. This emulated training environment is designed to utilize the existing Joint Information Operation Range (JIOR) transport layer to directly support USCYBERCOM's mission. Procurement funding increases storage capacity and improves the survivability\/durability of the target environment.\n \n2. Joint Interoperability Division (JID).  JID is a critical enabler to the training transformation program as sole DoD provider of Tactical Data Link and Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) training. Procurement funds support acquisition of one Satellite Simulator (SATSIM) and two Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) radio systems required for JICO mission equipment kits #2 and #3. SATSIM, SADL radios, and Thinklogical systems enable the JID to bring real-time situational awareness, location, targeting, and C2 data to smart bombs, dispersed joint forces on foot, or tactical vehicles in the air, land, or maritime environments."

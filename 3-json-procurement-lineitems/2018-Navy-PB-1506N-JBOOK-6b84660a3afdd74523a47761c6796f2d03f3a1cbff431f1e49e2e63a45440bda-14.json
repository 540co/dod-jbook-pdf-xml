            "val": "This line funds modifications to avionics equipment used for fleet training exercises by opposing forces and adversary forces used during counter surface and attack training scenarios and fleet exercises. The overall goal is to accurately simulate known and postulated electronic attack capability and tactics of radar and jammer threats expected to be encountered during operational deployments. Operation systems under Operational Safety and Improvement Program (OSIP) 119-83 were divested prior to FY 2002. \n\nCurrent equipment, AN\/ALQ-167, AN\/AST-6 and follow-on AN\/AST-9 pod variants are carried aboard F\/A-18, Lear Jet, Kfir (F-21), Hawker\/Hunter (F-58), Gulfstream (G-1) and F-16 aircraft. The AN\/ALQ-237 rack installation is an internal aircraft variant of the Filthy Badger used on F-5N. The remaining quantities of 15 legacy AST-6 pods are no longer supportable. These pods are being augmented\/replaced by AN\/AST-9 and will be flown until the end of their operational service life. FY 2010 - FY 2012 Below Threshold Reprogramming (BTR) funding procured 34 Advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) systems to address adversary forces training requirements per Naval Strike Air Warfare Center Urgent Operational Need Statement.  The adversary systems (aka HAVE ALL-Filthy Badger) comprise 19 ALQ-167 pods, 12 F-5 rack installs and 3 ACaP pods procured in coordination with the United States Air Force (USAF). \n\nAll subsequent installations are modifications to fleet systems based on the Adversary Electronic Attack DRFM Roadmap for Filthy Badger classified program requirements. The program focuses on the Filthy Badger modification schedule and support of the required engineering and logistics to accomplish these upgrades in future years."

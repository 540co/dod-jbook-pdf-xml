            "val": "Strategic overview:\n\nDPA Title III investments for DoD are informed by the Department's key investment strategy documents including the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Long Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP). Investments for DoD will enable the production of capacity for technologies and materials emerging from the technology base when the private sector is unable to respond within DoD timelines. Technology focus areas include space, undersea, air dominance, strike, missile defense, and emerging technologies.\n\nThe National Security Space Industrial and Supply Base (NSS ISB) Risk Mitigation Program was developed by the DoD to formulate a systematic process to fund mitigation efforts to rectify shortcomings in the space industrial and supply base. The objective is to ensure access to critical technologies and capabilities in the quality, quantity, and timeframes required to support U.S. Government space programs. Projects in this program are addressing cross-platform, multi-agency\/Service requirements. Projects are developed in response to risk mitigation determinations and prioritized critical requirements of stake holders in DoD and other agencies, as represented through the Department's Space Industrial Base Working Group.\n\n\n\nProgram Change Summary ($ in Millions)\n\nFY 2019 resources ($M):\nFY 2019 Request*   $38.578\n*Includes an increase to the Advanced Weapon Component\/Materials Production project due to changes in project timelines and obligation\/expenditure rates resulting in change of $1.177M.   \n      \n\nFY 2018 resources ($M):\nFY 2018 Request   $37.401 \nThe projects to be executed within FY 2018 resources are identified below.  The multi-year cost phasing of each of these projects is addressed in the P5 exhibit.  \n\nNational Security Space Industrial and Supply Base (NSS ISB)   $21.495\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers   $3.001\nAdvanced Weapon Component\/ Material Production   $2.901\nNext Generation Jammer Gallium Nitride (GaN) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) & Wideband Circulator Technologies $3.001\nNext Generation Soldier Protection   $7.003\n\n\nFY 2017 resources ($M):\nFY 2017 Request   $44.091\nCongressional increase   +$20.000 \nTotal FY 2017 Appropriated   $64.091\nTransfer from Department of Energy (DOE)   +$45.00\nTotal DPA Fund   $109.091\n\nFY 2017 Congressional increase of $20M was applied to the Alane Fuel project.  This project develops aluminum trihydride or \"AlH3\" industrial base in support of DoD applications by building two pilot production sources within the US. \nFY 2017 The $45M transfer from DOE was used for the Advanced Drop-in Bio-Fuel projects. This initiative establishes a domestic production plant producing Advanced Drop-in Biofuels which includes alternative jet fuel and marine diesel applications allowing the Navy and government agencies to meet their energy goals and objectives\n\nThis budget includes essential transformational initiatives using the authorities of Title III of the DPA.   Project descriptions are provided below for each of the P5 exhibit projects listed, and the single or multi-year cost phasing of each of the projects is addressed in the P5 exhibit.\n\nFY 2019 Project Descriptions:\n\nNSS ISB - Electron Beam Direct Write (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2019):  This project addresses a need for an advanced lithography tool for government integrated circuit developments.  It will have benefits in vastly reduced mask costs, improved design turn-around times, improved yield & reliability, improved design security (trust), and increased die sizes.  Production versions of this tool would be inserted in U.S. integrated circuit foundries fabricating parts for space and defense applications at a relatively low cost (versus commercial advanced lithography solutions in development) per system. The proposed project will accomplish the first such insertion. The project is to complete the development of a piece of lithography equipment that uses multiple electron beams (e-beams) to enable the direct transfer (\"writing\") of integrated circuit layer descriptions to a physical wafer being processed. Accomplishing this project brings a host of benefits when coupled with 1 D (1-dimensional or \"unidirectional\") layout techniques as part of a complementary ebeam write (CEBW) methodology.\n\nNSS ISB - Photovoltaic Substrates Supply Chain Diversification (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021): The purpose of this effort is to improve national security by addressing a critical gap in the North American supply chain for defense-critical, high-purity germanium (Ge) metal used for space-qualified photovoltaics in a wide range of warfighting and surveillance assets. Those assets include ground-based infrared (IR) optics for night vision operations, airborne IR windows and optical systems, space-based IR optics, and high-efficiency, multi-junction (M-J) photovoltaics (solar cells) used on over 95% of all space satellite assets, both Government and commercial. The investment will ensure the long-term domestic supply of space-qualified Ge substrates by successfully diversifying into higher-margin products that will maintain profitability and allow the company to serve Ge wafer markets.\n\nNSS ISB - Next Generation Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021): This project addresses a need for a multiple-phase Next-Generation scalable Reaction Wheel (NGRW) project to provide a systematic comprehensive, low cost\/risk investment affording potential for high return on investment. The goal is to generate or revive a domestic competitor, or to expand the existing vendor's product line, with a focus on smaller wheels using advanced technologies.  In addition, investigate encouraging a business partnership to maintain a second source in the U.S. Also, the project will investigate using another product controlled by a U.S. company.\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Digital\/Analog Production & Qualification (FY 2016 \u2013FY 2021):  It is imperative that government organizations responsible for national security, e.g., intelligence acquisition, missile early warning, missile defense, and other space requirements maintain a strong industrial base to supply technology necessary to design, develop, and fabricate Trusted, radiation hardened, high reliability and DoD space qualified Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP), such as very high speed data switches, and Multi-Core General Purpose Processors (MCGPP) at the less than or equal to 45nm technology node to support onboard processing and other critical applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the Radiation Hardened By Design 45nm ASIC\/ASSP design flow, optimize selected circuit designs to reduce power and increase performance and complete the design, fabrication, test and qualification of certain critical devices to include the MC-GPP. In addition to achieving an estimated improvement in performance of > 25% for power and performance for some specific designs, the proposed effort will support life-time acquisition buys of these critical circuits for some identified systems with attendant reductions in system technical, cost and schedule risks.\n\nNSS ISB - Trusted Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021):  The DoD and Intelligence Community have identified FPGAs as a critical enabling technology across a wide variety of present and future systems. Advanced, commercially available FPGAs do not meet the DoD requirements for Trusted systems as they are manufactured off-shore and are considered vulnerable to tampering and insertion of malicious software and\/or hardware.  This program seeks to improve the security posture and reduce the risk associated with FPGA technology by addressing security concerns in the design, development, fabrication and supply lifecycle of FPGA devices.  The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate an approach to ensure the availability of advanced \"Trusted\" and space qualified reprogrammable FPGA technology to support DoD\/IC applications including satellite and strategic missile systems.  Concerning this effort \"Trust\" is defined as assurance of the integrity and availability, of a product wherein that product will reliably operate as intentionally designed and not contain any malicious hardware and\/or software that will compromise the intended application; e.g., exfiltration of sensitive data, etc.\n\nNSS-ISB - Radiation Test Facilities (FY 2017 \u2013 FY 2021): Radiation test facilities remain a critical asset to NSS and all of DoD to be able to quantify and qualify the radiation hardness of electronic components.\nThis funding will upgrade and sustain these facilities to fulfill this need. As program budgets shrink in upcoming years, programs are less willing to sustain these facilities, leaving the burden on SMC and the NRO to fund them out of their ever shrinking O&M budget. Without assistance, one of the critical facilities will close (costing over $1B to reconstitute). Without the current test infrastructure, the DoD would be very under capacity for this capability.\n\nNSS ISB - High Strength\/High Modulus (HS\/HM) Carbon Fibers (FY 2017 \u2013 FY 2020): This investment program will ensure there is a domestic industry of qualified to produced High Strength and High Modulus (HS\/HM) carbon fibers for NSS and Defense applications. The program's purpose is to reduce inherent supply chain risks associated with a sole source foreign producer in Japan of unique and proprietary level materials while making available to DoD existing domestic second sources of similar materials that are reportedly higher quality, better performing and less expensive. This DoD investment program also supports greater U.S.-Japan (government and industry) defense supply chain security cooperation. If this investment is not made, programs will continue to utilize the sole foreign source, making it unlikely that new programs will consider sourcing from domestic suppliers. This puts NSS and Defense supply at continued risk of disruption due to foreign government controls as well as potential factory closures due to natural and manmade peacetime disasters as well as potential regional conflicts. Any one of these supply disruption scenarios could result in severe and long-lasting supply disruptions affecting multiple programs and their related costs, schedules and performance requirements-in addition to delaying important capabilities to our warfighters.\n\nNSS ISB - Mercury Cadmium Telluride Infrared Sensors (Prior Years - FY2021):\nThe goal of this program is to establish and maintain a high quality production capability for Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) epitaxy grown on Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at key US-owned and operated foundries in order to assure the necessary supply of strategic focal plane arrays (FPAs) to National Security Space (NSS) agencies when needed. The primary goal is to demonstrate on-shore MCT detectors are equivalent in performance to FPAs utilizing off-shore substrates. \n\n\nProjects Other (non-NSS):\n\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers Production Capacity (prior years and FY 2017 \u2013FY 2019): Developed under funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (HSARPA), the Secure Hybrid Composite Container (SHCC) is an intermodal ISO shipping container providing advanced security features, while meeting all the operational, structural, and customs requirements of standard steel 20ft and 40ft shipping containers. The security system is designed to confirm the integrity of the container and report breaches to the cognizant authorities. The container includes the capability to be tracked during its shipment and alert officials to track deviations and alarms. The ultimate goal of the container is to provide the level of security to law enforcement officials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not been inserted into the container for smuggling into the US. Investment under Title III to establish initial production capability for the secure hybrid composite container can help satisfy an estimated 3,000 container per year initial government need from the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community agencies requiring secure shipping containers. A production line with an output of approximately 100 containers per year output is planned. Previously budgeted FY2016 funding was executed with prior year funds.\n\nNext Generation Jammer Gallium Nitride (GaN) MMIC & Wideband Circulator Technologies (Prior Years and FY 2017- FY 2019): This project is an investment in production technology and capacity expansion for gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and wideband circulator technologies for Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program requirements. The objective is to establish\/expand one or more domestic sources for GaN integrated circuit components to ensure the availability of critical components required for the Next Generation Jammer and other electronic warfare systems. Additionally, this initiative will mitigate program risk by ensuring on-shore availability of critical components, maintain secure sources for these essential electronic components through oversight of sources and processes, and address process and quality improvements to drive down costs.\n\nAdvanced Weapon Component\/Materials Production (FY 2016, FY 2018 \u2013 Continuing): The purpose of this continuous effort is to use DPA Title III authorities to make investments in the domestic industrial base that maintain the timely availability of critical-need, technologically superior production capabilities that are independently available within the U.S. for both current and future weapon systems, as informed by the Department's key investment strategy documents including the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the Long Range Research and Development Plan (LRRDP). These resources will focus on projects that span multiple agencies, weapons platforms, and Service needs, enabling the production of capacity for technologies and materials emerging from the technology base that the private sector is unable to respond to within DoD timelines. Technology focus areas include space, undersea, air dominance, strike, missile defense, and emerging technologies.\n\n\nFY 2018 Project Descriptions:\n\nNSS ISB - Trusted Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021)\n\nNSS ISB - Next Generation Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021) \n\nNSS ISB - Photovoltaic Substrates Supply Chain Diversification (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2021)\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Digital\/Analog Production & Qualification (FY 2016 \u2013FY 2021)\n\nNSS ISB - Electron Beam Direct Write (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2019)\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation Test Facilities (FY 2017 \u2013 FY 2021)\n \nNSS ISB - HS\/HM Carbon Fibers (FY 2017 \u2013 FY 2020\n\nNSS ISB - Mercury Cadmium Telluride Infrared Sensors (Prior Years - FY2021)\n\nProjects Other (non-NSS):\n\nNext Generation Jammer Gallium Nitride (GaN) MMIC & Wideband Circulator Technologies (Prior Years and FY 2017- FY 2019)\n\nSecure Composite Shipping Containers (prior years and FY 2017 \u2013FY 2019)\n\nNext Generation Solider Protection (FY 2016 - FY 2018): The purpose of this project is to create a manufacturing capacity to produce lightweight, high-strength, inherently fire-resistant co-polymer aramid fibers to provide lightweight force protection for Soldiers and air, ground, and naval platforms and bases. Examples include lighter and stronger body armor, helmets, pelvic protection, enhanced combat vehicle survivability, enhanced aviation platform survivability, and integrated base protection. A next generation of co-polymer aramid fibers would provide a step-change increase in tenacity over existing fibers, a key attribute for enabling lighter-weight ballistic protection.\n\nAdvanced Weapon Component\/Materials Production (FY 2016, FY 2018 \u2013 Continuing)\n\nFY 2017 Project Descriptions\n\nNSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Transistors & Diodes (FY 2016 \u2013 FY 2017):  Many present and future DoD and intelligence systems have identified Rad Hard components as a critical base technology. There are very few remaining suppliers of Rad Hard space qualified components such as diodes, Metal Oxide on Silicon Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET), insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), Optocouplers and other Optical devices, Glassless diodes, JANKC diode dies, and more. These components are used almost universally to provide power and conditioned signals to Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) circuits.  Since this is an extremely niche market, a single company is the only manufacturer of components that designs and produces entirely with US persons in a US facility, and specializes in military, aerospace and space. The company also provides products to commercial space, to companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Space Systems Loral.  The reduction in demand for strategic radiation hardened electronics (RHE) (e.g., >1Mrad total ionization dose) over the past 15 years has resulted in a substantial decrease of the industrial base, which is down to two main suppliers, and only one supplier, which designs and manufactures their components in the USA today and has a proven process for Rad Hard by Design products.  \n\nProjects Other (non NSS-ISB):\n\nAdvanced Microelectronics Trusted Foundry (FY 2017):  This project supports the Department's efforts to maintain domestic trusted sources of advanced microelectronics production.  AT&L's strategy is focused on improving capability to evaluate and validate trust of microelectronics parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard, and develop alternative approaches to the current manufacturing-driven means of trust to enable broader DoD access to commercial state of the art technology."

            "val": "The switchboard program provides mission critical switching capability required to link shipboard combat equipment including weapons, launchers, sensors, computers and navigation equipment. In essence, switchboards serve as\nthe central connection point for most elements of combat and weapon systems, interior communications, data transfer, and command and control systems. They are designed to accommodate either analog, digital interfaces, or a\ncombination of both. In total, this budget item supports approximately 200 ships and 1,000 pieces of equipment throughout the acquisition life cycle.\n\nFunctions include: data routing; action cutout; test and operating mode selection (including casualty back-up modes); power monitoring and control; circuit protection; peripheral equipment isolation; and signal processing,\nfrequency conversion amplification and switching. In summary, the primary purpose is to provide systems intra and interface compatibility.\n\nChanges in other elements of the combat and Interior Communication (IC) systems will frequently mandate either conjunctive modification to switchboards via ship change documents (SCDs), ordnance alteration (ORDALT)\/\nfield changes (FCs) or partial or complete replacement of existing switchboards. Typical switchboard mods include hardware\/field change kits, ORDALT\/SCD\/FC instructions, technical manual updates and revisions to other\nsupporting documentation. Hull unique switchboard configurations require hull unique documentation. Subsequent alterations to these switchboards require hull unique design, hardware, installation, and checkout procedures.\nNew Switchboards are normally installed during a regular overhaul by a shipyard.\n\nCommand and control switchboards are currently installed on and are required for almost all surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships. Individual switchboard unit cost varies from ship to ship, depending upon size,\ncomplexity, and whether analog or digital interfaces or some combination thereof are utilized. Modifications to existing switchboards via Ship Alterations (SHIPALTs), SCDs, ORDALTs or FCs are quantified by kits or change\npackages rather than individual units. The number of kits required for different classes of ships are as follows: DDGs\/CGs require three to four (3 - 4) per ship, LSDs require two (2) per ship, LPDs require one (1) per ship, MCMs\nrequire (3) per ship and LHDs require two (2) per ship. The magnitude of modifications also varies, as Cruiser Modernization is considerably more complex than the Amphibious Class hulls. Switchboard hardware is normally\nprocured by the Invitation For Bids (IFB) process, from manufacturers on Qualified Products List (QPL)-17000. There are currently six companies listed on QPL-17000. All contracts awarded are competitive, fixed price.\n\n[P40A \/ GE003 ENG UPGRADES\/MODS TO EQUIPMENT & TECH DOCUMENTATION]: Combat Systems & Interior Communication Switchboard Engineering and Modifications Upgrades to Equipment, Drawings, Technical Manuals (TMs) Allowance Parts Lists (APLs) and Allowance Equipage Lists (AELs).  This line covers the costs to upgrade\/modify existing equipment and associated technical documentation to implement and validate upgraded switching configurations essential for the ships' switchboards to properly integrate all elements of the Combat System and Interior Communication interfaces.  The upgraded engineering modification drives the procurement of hardware modification kits (i.e., ORDALTs & Field Changes).  These engineering modifications are essential to the functional deployment of Battle Force Interoperability."

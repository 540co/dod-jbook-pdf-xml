FY 2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy. The Budget requests these funds in OCO to comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission.  The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. \n\nIn FY 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an enduring capability.  As reported on 31 Oct 2018 the Army intends to field two interim IFPC batteries of Iron Dome in FY 2020, while concurrently componentizing a launcher and interceptor solutions that are interoperable and integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor by FY 2023. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit. Prior to making a final decision on the enduring solution, the Army plans to conduct experimentation and analysis with Army sensors and IBCS to determine the complexity of integration of the componentized launcher and interceptor solution. The final decision point, planned for 2QFY2020, will decide between a componentized Iron Dome launcher or a CMD launcher from industry for the enduring IFPC Inc 2 capability. \n\nThis budget request assumes approval of the 2019 Above Threshold Reprogramming request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress."

The ATR requested $31.286 million of FY19 PE 0604319A MIPA Advanced Procurement (originally for launcher long-lead items) and $20.900 million from PE 0605052A\/EY7 to be realigned to IFPC's PE 0604319A MIPA funding line, along with the current $145.636 million from PE 0604319A MIPA to procure two interim Iron Dome batteries for assessment of operational utility under 10 U.S. code, paragraph 2373 (Procurement for Experimental Purposes). This budget request and Acquisition Strategy assumes approval of the 2019 ATR request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress.\n \nFY 2020 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $9.337 million provides for the support and deployment of 12 Iron Dome missile systems as interim CMD, as detailed in the 31 Oct 2018 Report to Congress.  \n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-81), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\n\nThis program supports the Air and Missile Defense Cross Functional Team (CFT)."

The IFPC Inc 2 system consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission.  The Objective counter-RAM mission employs both alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. \n\nIn FY 2018, the Army evaluated alternative strategies to address an Army interim CM defense (CMD) capability at critical strategic fixed site locations while continuing the development of an enduring capability.  As reported on 31 Oct 2018 the Army intends to field two interim IFPC batteries of Iron Dome in FY 2020, while concurrently componentizing a launcher and interceptor solutions that are interoperable and integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) open systems architecture, IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS), and the Sentinel sensor by FY 2023. For each of the interim capability's Iron Dome Batteries, the Army intends to employ a configuration that matches the Israeli Firing Unit. Prior to making a final decision on the enduring solution, the Army plans to conduct experimentation and analysis with Army sensors and IBCS to determine the complexity of integration of the componentized launcher and interceptor solution. The final decision point, planned for 2QFY2020, will decide between a componentized Iron Dome launcher or a CMD launcher from industry for the enduring IFPC Inc 2 capability. \n\nThis budget request assumes approval of the 2019 Above Threshold Reprogramming request which aligns FY 2018 and FY 2019 funding to the plan provided in the IFPC Acquisition Strategy Report submitted to Congress."

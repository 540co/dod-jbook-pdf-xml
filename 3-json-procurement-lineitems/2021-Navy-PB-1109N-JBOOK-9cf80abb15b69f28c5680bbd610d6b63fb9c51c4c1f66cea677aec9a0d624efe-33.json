            "val": "Motor Transport Modifications funds numerous essential modifications, initiatives, and new vehicle procurements that are required to address operational priorities, engineering change proposals, safety concerns, support equipment inefficiencies, tool malfunctions, product quality deficiencies, and other issues that affect vehicle reliability, safety, availability, and readiness. A proactive and focused approach ensures proper vehicle sustainment and life-cycle management and allows USMC to develop and implement improvements, as needed, to respond to the evolving requirements of the Marine Corps and sustain the fleet.\n\nMedium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) - The MTVR is the Marine Corps' medium ground lift capability supporting all elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  With its 70% off-road mission profile and the addition of a highly survivable armor package, the MTVR is heavily used in contingency operations as well as missions supporting humanitarian operations.  It has a payload of 7.1 tons off-road and 15 tons on-road, a high-performance suspension, traction control, central tire inflation system, and automatic transmission, to transport personnel, ammunition, bulk cargo, and\/or bulk fuel and water in a variety of environments.  The MTVR family of vehicles includes a cargo variant (both standard and extended wheel base configurations), a dump truck, a wrecker, a tractor and a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) Rocket Resupply System Vehicle. This program funds numerous product improvements to the MTVR via engineering change proposals (ECPs), resulting from post-production requirements in force protection, communications, on-board situational awareness, and improved fuel efficiency required across the range of military operations, as well as addressing  product quality deficiencies and other issues that impact vehicle safety, reliability, availability and readiness.   The requirements capability change to improve fuel efficiency for the MTVR is part of the program's initiatives to lower fuel consumption and extend the vehicle's cruising range, while lowering operating costs over the life of the MTVR.       \n\nThe Family of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FoV): Provides Warfighters multi-mission platforms capable of mitigating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), underbody mines, and small arms fire threats. Multiple MRAP vehicle Categories (CATs) have been procured, fielded, and are now being sustained, such as the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV), with combat operations (OPS) in rural, mountainous, and urban terrain.  Category I - Urban combat operations, ambulance. Category II - Multi-mission ops-convoy lead, troop transport, ambulance, utility vehicle. Category III - Mine\/IED clearance ops, explosive ordnance disposal. Funding includes required Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)\/subsystems and ECP\/Capability Insertion in response to an Urgent Universal Needs Statements (UUNS) and Warfighter safety and survivability requirements.\n\nThe Family of P-19 Replacement (P-19R): Vehicles replace the obsolete A\/S32P-19A Crash Fire Rescue fleet in support of expeditionary airfield operations and the supporting establishment. The vehicle is outfitted with advanced fire suppression equipment.  It provides rescue and aircraft fire fighting capabilities to permanent and expeditionary airfields throughout the Marine Corps. The P-19R may also be employed to fight structural fires in support of base camps and as firefighting support to other elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), such as ammunition supply points, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) distribution points, or hazardous material storage facilities.\n  \nThe Family of Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) Modification: The LVSR is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Heavy Lift Capability system. The LVSR is built on the Oshkosh TAC-4 fully independent suspension, allowing it to traverse a variety of challenging terrain while carrying a payload of up to 22.5 tons. The LVSR accomplishes a variety of tactical logistics missions using armored and unarmored cargo, tractor and recovery variants. Funding provides for modifications required for the LVSR fleet of vehicles, such as updated brackets and cables for warfighter systems (e.g., jammers) as they are upgraded.  These modifications also include critical safety upgrades and improved blast seats that reduce occupant injury during IED strikes.

Modifications include the installation of brackets to convert from the Crew Vehicle Receiver\/Jammer (CVRJ-2) to the MODi Vehicle Power Amplifier (MVPA-2), the Turret Gunner Restraint System, the Automatic Fire Extinguisher System (AFES), and the TOCNET communications suite.  The MVPA-2 enables the vehicle to block frequencies of IEDs; the Turret Gunner Restraint System installs a six point harness for the gunner in the turret (currently no restraint system in place); the AFES ensures Marines do not incur life threatening burns; and the TOCNET kit enables the driver, turret gunner, and troops in troop carrier to have sufficient communications instead of the current method of voice commands, which is ineffective in combat operations.   Due to heavy use in severe conditions, many of the vehicles scheduled for installation needed repairs or were missing prior modifications (such as unique brackets), and were returned to service without the most recent modifications.  This funding ensures both the (86) vehicles at the Marine Expeditionary Unit Augmentation Program Kuwait (MAP-K) and the (44) vehicles at Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) are the highest configuration and have received all combat-enabling modifications. These vehicles support Freedom's Sentinel Afghanistan.  Without adequate funding to install the combat-enabling modifications, the vehicles operating in theater will remain ill-equipped for Fleet Marine Force missions.\n\nThe Family of Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) requires $.583M of FY21 OCO to modify and install brackets to convert from Crew Vehicle Receiver\/Jammer (CVRJ-2) to the MODi Vehicle Power Amplifier (MVPA-2).  This modification includes development of a production level technical data package (TDP), development of modification instructions, production verification and engineering support for installation. Installation of the MVPA-2 will allow for the LVSR to continue to have the ability to counter IED threats."

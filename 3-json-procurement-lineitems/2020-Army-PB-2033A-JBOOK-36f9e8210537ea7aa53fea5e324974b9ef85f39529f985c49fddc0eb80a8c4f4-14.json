            "val": "The M240 series machine guns are available in different configurations for various applications.  The M240B Machine Gun is a ground version of the original M240 Machine Gun, 7.62MM Medium Machine Gun class weapon, designed as a coaxial\/pintle-mounted weapon for tanks and light armored vehicles.  The M240B also includes: a flash suppressor, front sight, carrying handle, buttstock, pistol grip, bipod, heat shield and rear sight assembly.  The M240B Machine Gun may also be tripod-mounted and used in conjunction with a traversing and elevating mechanism and mount pintle.  The M240H is a variant of this same family of Machine Guns and is employed as the self defensive armament subsystem for the UH-60 BLACK HAWK and CH-47 Chinook Helicopters.  The M240H uses the same receiver and barrel as the M240B but has a spade grip trigger assembly.  It also has a unique mounting interface and pintle to properly interface with the helicopter platform.  The lighter M240L replaces the M240B in Special Forces\/Rangers, Light Infantry and Airborne units.  The M240L significantly reduces the weight of the current M240B, by approximately 5 pounds, while maintaining the same level of reliability.  The weight reduction is accomplished through the use of lightweight materials and innovative manufacturing techniques."

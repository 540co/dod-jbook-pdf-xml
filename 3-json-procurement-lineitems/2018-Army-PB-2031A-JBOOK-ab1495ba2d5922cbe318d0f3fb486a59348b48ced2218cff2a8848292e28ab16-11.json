The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems. Protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS receives and disseminates battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles. Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.\n\nThe UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control, and UAS payload product. The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.\n\nThe Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1. The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems and features Directorate of Simulation (DOS) accredited Shadow software and Gray Eagle software."

Current planning allocates $9.3 Million for procurement of common UGCS computing\/communications hardware and associated integration\/qualification.  $3.3 Million is allocated for the procurement of a controller for all UGCS (112 Gray Eagle and 208 Shadow) and UMS (106) plus initial spares.  The remaining $2.4 Million is allocated for cross-domain hardware (6 minimum) and initial UMS hardware retrofits to increase manned-unmanned training capability.  Retrofits will be required for all 106 UMS but this funding will only buy a few (<25%)."

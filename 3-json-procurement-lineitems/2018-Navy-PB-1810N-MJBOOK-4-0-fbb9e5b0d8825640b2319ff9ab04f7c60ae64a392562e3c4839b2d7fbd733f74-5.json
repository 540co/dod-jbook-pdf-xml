            "val": "This budget line item funds the procurement of equipment to support Navy-Marine Corps amphibious operations, Logistics Over the Shore, and Joint Logistics Over the Shore operations. This provides the ability to execute the ship to shore transfer of vehicles, dry cargo, and liquid cargo, delivered over bare beaches, as well as through improved and semi-improved port facilities. \n\nThis program is a critical component that enables the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) concept. It is designed and intended to interface with MPF vessels during initial combat operations (Assault Echelon and immediate sustainment of the AE force) and then with Roll-On\/Roll-Off, container, dry cargo, and liquid cargo ships to provide war material to the Assault Follow-On Echelon (AFOE). The equipment is employed by the Naval Support Element (Naval Beach Groups) and the Amphibious Ready Group-Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG\/MEU) team. \n\nThe Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) consists of Causeway Ferries (CF), Warping Tugs (WT), a Roll-on\/Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF), and a Floating Causeway (FC) pier. All of these systems work in concert to deliver critical war material from MPF and AFOE ships, across a bare beach, and into the hands of warfighters. The INLS achieved IOC in FY06 and FOC in FY11, requiring sustainment efforts to maintain availability for operation in the face of aging components and technical obsolescence of the various control systems. The Sealift Support Program Office is providing lifecyle support to the INLS program as well as other specialized equipment and vehicles that directly participate in and contribute to amphibious operations. Specific to this lifecycle support mission, an improvement is being made to the waterjet system to extend the lifespan of critical components that otherwise would render the craft non-mission capable if the component were to fail, necessitating a significant and time-consuming depot-level repair."
        },
        "Justification": {
            "val": "The budget requests funds for INLS Waterjet modifications that upgrade primary propulsion components that are failing at an unacceptable rate. The INLS Waterjet modification will increase mean time between overhauls from 12 months to 60 months and extend the life of the craft. \n\nThe increase of these upgrades from FY17 to FY18 is critical to meet the delivery deadlines of ready-to-deploy craft for loading onto the MPF ships as part of the MPF Maintenance Cycle (MMC).  \n\nFailure to meet this timeline will result in the INLS craft not receiving this critical upgrade for up to three additional years, leading to significantly increased risk to the ability to execute tasking in support of COCOMs.\n\nFY 2017 decrease in Amphibious Equipment OPN by $0.324M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015."

            "val": "The Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) is a multi-sensor air-to-ground missile that will increase lethality for the Joint Force Commander against time sensitive targets in challenging environments.  JAGM entered production in FY2018, leveraging the HELLFIRE system. AF will augment the HELLFIRE inventory with JAGMs to improve the lethality of the MQ-9 Reaper. \n\nThe Army is the Lead Service for the JAGM program with Air Force missiles being procured through the Army's Redstone Arsenal.  The JAGM is the next generation of aviation-launched, fire and forget missiles to augment HELLFIRE capability.  The JAGM multi-mode guidance section is integrated with the combat-proven HELLFIRE II (AGM-114R) propulsion, warhead, and control section.  JAGM will provide precision-kill capability and be used by joint service aircraft for destruction of high value stationary, moving, and relocatable land and maritime targets from standoff range in day, night, adverse weather, and obscured operational environments. JAGMs will be used by the MQ-9 Reaper aircraft.\n\nJAGM procurement funding supports the entire JAGM system to include resolution of obsolescence, end-of-life buys, safety, insensitive munitions, reliability, weapon integration activities, test sets, engineering changes, modifications, and production issues.  Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Unit cost may vary based on procurement quantities of Lead Service, other Services and\/or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) from the HELLFIRE and JAGM production capacity.  Starting in FY2020, JAGM and HELLFIRE missiles will be procured using the same annual production contract. \n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0201109F.\n\nNote:  Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options\/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S. Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION."

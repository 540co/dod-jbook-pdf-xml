            "val": "Distance Support: A Navy Enterprise effort that combines people, processes and technology into a collaborative infrastructure without regard to geographic location. Distance Support (DS) is comprised of the following three components: Infrastructure, Content and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Infrastructure provides the \"transport\" of DS applications and data to and from operating units and shore installations in support of various processes. Technology infrastructure also includes the data replication and shipboard IT servers that bring the DS functionality to the sailor. Content includes specific applications, systems and processes produced by various Navy communities of Interest. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) capabilities include the \"Navy 311\" Website, BMC Remedy Software, Shared Data Environment, Business Intelligence and Predictive Modeling software, Avaya telephony and Call Management System, and the Navy 311 Support Center, which is the hub of Distance Support, providing the single point of entry for support requests for fleet customers on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year basis (24\/7\/365).  \n\nThe Navy Information Application Product Suite (NIAPS) is comprised of integrated hardware and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software that bring various workstations, storage, servers, applications and content into a common environment for shipboard deployment.  NIAPS provides data compression and replication capability and is designed to re-host typically shore\/web-based applications afloat to minimize bandwidth and provide maximum capability.  NIAPS is comprised of 27 applications and databases launched from a single Distance Support (DS) Portal on NIAPS server. NIAPS runs applications specifically tailored to individual afloat units for training, career management, maintenance, technical drawings, logistics, human resources, as well as morale and welfare support (Quality of life) which are produced by various Navy functional organizations. NIAPS gives a ship access to critical applications and data using internal shipboard networks, which is faster and cheaper than using external bandwidth and satellite time.\n  \nData Center Consolidation (DCC): DCC procures and installs data center hardware, software, and licenses for established Navy Enterprise Data Centers (NEDCs) and other approved hosting locations as part of the Department of Defense's Information Technology efficiency to consolidate and standardize the Navy's Data Center footprint. DCC will complete the data center consolidation effort in FY19.\n\nSPAWAR IW Platform: Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and PEOC4I Shore & Expeditionary Integration Program Office are recognized as the Navy's Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Information Technology (C4ISR\/IT) integration Subject Matter Expert (SME) delivering Shore Information Warfare (IW) Platform Capabilities.  Funding supports the identification and validation of C4ISR\/IT system requirements and provides system of system architecture, integration and installation design plans tailored to deliver specific required Capability to Shore IW Platforms. Shore IW Platforms support assured Command and Control, voice, video and data communications, Precise Time and Astrometry. and intelligence support services that are critical to allowing the flow of information from Operational Commanders to the War Fighters both afloat and ashore. MILCON projects associated with Shore IW Platforms require complex planning based on the required capability which includes advanced planning, integration and installation of numerous C4ISR\/IT systems across multiple programs of record that support Command Centers, Operations Centers and Master Telecommunication Facilities, CONUS and OCONUS. \n \n\nTelephony: Tactical Voice and Video Communications and Modernization:\nThe Department of Defense (DoD), Chief Information Officer (CIO) has prioritized the modernization of network infrastructure to be regionally based, centrally managed and cyber secure. This includes migrating existing infrastructure from Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to Internet Protocol (IP) based communications to enable Unified Capabilities (UC). Telephony procures and integrates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software to meet the DoD-CIO TDM to IP mandate for the Navy. Program requirements include: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Voice over Secure Internet Protocol (VoSIP), Video Teleconferencing over Secure Internet Protocol (VTCoSIP), Telephony Unified Messaging System (TUMS), Regional Telephony Management System (RTMS), Navy Video Conferencing System (NVCS), NVCS Coalition (NVCS-C), Internet Protocol (IP) Trunking, Aegis Ashore, and Telephony systems infrastructure (e.g. cable plant). Telephony system installations and\/or upgrades occur at facilities in accordance with requirements as identified by Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA).\n\nMILCON C4I Shore Based Enterprise Network Enhancements (Telephony):\nFunding additionally supports procurement and installation of mission related Telephony equipment at the following shore sites:\n - MILCON P-913: Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Atlantic\n - MILCON P-621: NCTAMS Atlantic Det Rota Spain\n - MILCON P-131: NCTAMS Atlantic Det Souda Bay\n - MILCON P-130: Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Sigonella Italy\n\nMILCON Project P-013: Navy Information Operations Command, Hawaii (NIOC HI) performs all duties assigned by Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT), Fleet Cyber Command (FLTCYBERCOM) \/ Commander Tenth Fleet (COMTENTHFLT), Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), and the Director, National Security Agency. NIOC HI conducts and provides support to information warfare, cyber, signals intelligence, Information Operations (IO) and electronic warfare mission areas in the Pacific Fleet area of responsibility (PAC AOR). At the direction of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), FLTCYBERCOM \/ COMTENTHFLT will be deploying substantial Cyber Mission Forces to Oahu. NCTAMS PAC and NIOC HI require close collaboration and alignment between the elements of the intelligence community under NIOC HI and the network operations under NCTAMS PAC in a controlled environment. MILCON Project P-013 provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards."

Telephony system installations and\/or upgrades occur at facilities in accordance with requirements as identified by Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) (i.e. FLTNOCs, Fleet Telecommunications sites, and Aegis Ashore Sites). \n\nProcurement and installation unit cost variances are based on the location of the region\/site (CONUS,OCONUS), number of sites in the region, the various site architectures and requirements, the age and type of systems modernized, and user density (number of users). Telephony quantities represent the number of regions that are being replaced\/modernized in the given Fiscal Year (FY). Regions: CONUS: Southwest, Pacific Northwest, Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic. OCONUS: Western Pacific, Guantanamo, Europe, Middle East.\n\n- Collateral Equipment, Telephony MILCON (-$4.424M):  Funding decrease in FY20 is the result of procurement and installation occurring in two phases to align with the MICLON transition schedule.  Phase I (procurement and integration) in FY19 and Phase II (testing and installation) in FY20.  In FY20, funding supports installation and testing of mission related Telephony equipment at the following shore sites:\n - MILCON P-913: NCTAMS LANT C4I\n - MILCON P-621: NCTAMS LANT Det Rota Spain\n\n\nCollateral Equipment, MILCON Project P-013 (+$2.066M) includes: \nFunding supports procurement and installation of mission related command, control, communications, computers and intelligence\/Information Technology (C4I\/IT) equipment to new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMSPAC) Facility in Wahiawa.

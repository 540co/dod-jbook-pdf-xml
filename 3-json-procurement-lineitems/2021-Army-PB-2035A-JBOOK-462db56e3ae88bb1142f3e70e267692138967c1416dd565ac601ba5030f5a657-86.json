            "val": "BE4168 - General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS): GFEBS is the Army's core financial management system for administering its General Fund. Full Deployment was reached in 2012 and the system is currently in the Capability Support (sustainment) phase of the Business Acquisition Cycle, focused on modernization, cyber security, and system enhancements  while also conducting capability enhancements to meet policy and deliver a more accurate picture of Army financial awareness. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and enable the Army to comply with the Federal Financial Management. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). \n\nB55511 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) leveraging the GFEBS base system as the Army's core financial management system certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS base system without compromising classified information or missions, or endangering soldiers. Therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPR), leveraging off of the sustained system design while providing additional implementation that includes additional requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPR and NIPR with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology, and will modify capability to maintain a synchronized software baseline with the GFEBS base system to maintain efficiencies in capability enhancements, training documentation, and sustainment support."

            "val": "FY 2021 Procurement dollars support software and hardware infrastructure upgrades to bring GFEBS reporting and analytics in-line with processing performance thresholds established in the GFEBS Capabilities Production Document (CPD). Software upgrades support auditability requirements as well as the compliance of the system's required software standards. GFEBS base program procurement dollars will be used to prevent end of service life by the Original Equipment Manufacturer, SAP, and enable a migration of the GFEBS-SA database from Oracle to SAP as part of the synchronization between GFEBS and GFEBS-SA in FY 2021.  Additionally, procurement funds will be leveraged to support deployments in conjunction with GFEBS-SA Full Deployment schedule to sites not currently running the GFEBS base system.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the fiscal year FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses and providing military support to civil authorities."

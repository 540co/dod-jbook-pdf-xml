FY2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The Budget requests these funds in OCO to  comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThis category includes various munitions items to support air base ground defense, air rescue and aircrew\/ground training.  \n\nThe Air Force procures munitions to maintain appropriate quantities in the War Reserve Materiel Munitions and test and training stockpiles.  Active, Guard and Reserve components draw from the WRM stockpiles as required and receive test and training allocations annually based on current-year requirements.\n\nAll items have an annual procurement value of less than $5 million and are code A.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\n\nPEs associated with this P-1 Line are 0207580F and 0207599F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

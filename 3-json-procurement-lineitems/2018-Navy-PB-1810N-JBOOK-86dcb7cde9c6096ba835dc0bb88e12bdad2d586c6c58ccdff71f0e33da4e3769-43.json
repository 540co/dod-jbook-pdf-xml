            "val": "Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) provides network interface capability, wideband encryption, and command link upgrades to the Communication Data Link System (CDLS).  Primarily, NTCDL provides multiple networked, simultaneous links to support surface to air, air to surface, air to air, and surface to surface platform Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) communications, where CDLS is a single link, point to point, air to surface\/surface to air capability. The current NTCDL program budget begins in FY22, and supports the fielding of NTCDL Increment 1 on surface platforms to include CG, DDG, LCS, CVN, LHA, LHD, LCC.\n\nCommunication Data Link System (CDLS) Technical Refresh (TR) provides fielding link management computer upgrades to meet Fleet Windows 10 Operating System IA requirements, a second 360 degree data link, as well as the inclusion of digital distribution of ISR, Full Motion Video (FMV), and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) data in both Cypher Text (CT) and Plain Text (PT) to Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) for shipboard dissemination to support Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD). Supports various Common Data Link (CDL) air platforms including MH-60R, MQ-4 Triton, MQ-8B\/C Fire Scout, P-3, P-8, and Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) vehicle, to include command and control of the aircraft during flight operations. The CDLS TR upgrade includes Flight Deck Checkout test link between aircraft on the deck through CDLS to end-user prior to flight operations to ensure End-to-End connectivity of organic assets prior to missions.\n\nLink 16 Antenna will be applied as part of the back-fit modification that are intended for the Expeditionary Mobile Base-3 and 4 (formerly Mobile Landing Platform Afloat Forward Staging Base - MLP-3 and 4 AFSB) to handle various special operations mission sets after delivery."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY18 Funding supports procurement and installation of 4 Communication Data Link System (CDLS) Technical Refresh (TR) systems for CVN platforms. Due to increased fleet Common Data Link (CDL) operations and obsolescence issues, a technical refresh is required to extend the life of the system beyond its intended design. CDLS TR addresses whole system reliability, sub-component obsolescence, and emerging Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2AD) Fleet requirements that are significantly degrading Fleet readiness, including Operational Availability (Ao), and system supportability. CDLS TR also provides IA\/Cyber security upgrades to Windows 10 OS."

            "val": "1.  The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, affordable systems to operational commanders.  The Aircraft Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness support 1) management and upkeep of government-owned industrial plants; 2) management of industrial base assessments; 3) environmental compliance and pollution prevention at government-owned industrial plants.\n\n2. Four basic activities are funded in this appropriation: Industrial Facilities, Industrial Base Assessments, Environmental Compliance, and Pollution Prevention.\n\nIndustrial Facility Capital Type Rehabilitation cost element (MPC 3000): Provides for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment, property appraisals and energy conservation at government-owned, contractor-operated industrial facilities.  These plants are the backbone of defense weapon system assembly and maintenance for the B-2, U-2, F-16, F-15SA, P-3 C-130, C-5B, RQ-4 Global Hawk, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter & classified programs.\n\nIndustrial Base Assessment cost element (MPC 6000): Provides for the identification, analysis and assessment of industrial base concerns dealing with aircraft research and development, production, and sustainment.  These assessments provide timely and accurate industrial base information to support Air Force decisions on 1) aircraft weapon system acquisition risks; 2) budget allocation investments; 3) weapon system sustainment and logistics support; and 4) defense industry mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.  Supports joint-Service industrial base planning on shared commodities, technologies, and facilities.\n\nEnvironmental Compliance cost element (MPC 7000) provides for the efforts needed to maintain compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding operation of the government-owned contractor-operated industrial facilities. The environmental compliance program includes efforts to enhance compliance through pollution prevention reducing controlled emissions and use of hazardous materials.\n\nPollution Prevention activities (MPC 6044) at USAF industrial government owned, contractor operated (GOCO) facilities to reduce emission of hazardous materials to air, land, and water, while reducing the cost to the Air Force as facility owner, as a customer for products manufactured in the plants, and through process improvements that can be transitioned to Air Force users.  Activities include demonstration and validation of improved processes, materials and equipment that reduce emissions, regulatory burdens, and weapon systems life cycle costs.  Also included are energy conservation initiatives, pollution prevention opportunity assessments; and recovery\/recycling to minimize hazardous waste.  These activities reduce risk to performance, schedule, and cost of the facilities and weapon systems.  These activities support the Air Force goals under the Pollution Prevention Act, Executive Order 13693, the AF\/CV and SAF\/IE Pollution Prevention Policy, the USD(AT&L) hexavalent chromium reduction policy, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Funding for Poll Prevention moved to PE 78011F in FY16 and beyond.  Prior to FY15, these funds were provided through PE 078054F.  In FY19 moved from BP19 to BP14.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F."

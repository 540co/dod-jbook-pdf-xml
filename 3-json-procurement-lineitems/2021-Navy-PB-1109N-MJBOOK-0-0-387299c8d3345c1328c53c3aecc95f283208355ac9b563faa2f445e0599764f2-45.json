            "val": "Family of Construction Equipment (FCE) provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps construction equipment. Funding supports equipment to conduct engineer missions such as constructing counter-mobility obstacles, building pioneer roads, establishing survivability positions, development of expeditionary airfields and general engineering support to forward operating bases and lodgment areas. Construction Equipment includes: Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) Kit which is capable of creating useable landing surfaces by new construction or repair of existing facilities. The ADR Kit uses modern development in construction equipment and materials, is easily deployable, flexible enough to work in all geographic locations and environments, and can quickly repair craters and spalls of all sizes.  It also includes the High Mobility Engineer Excavator (HMEE) which is a self-deployable excavation system with attachments to execute a wide range of mobility, counter-mobility, general engineering and survivability missions.  \n\nFamily of Material Handling Equipment (FMHE) line is a roll-up line that provides for the replacement and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Marine Corps MHE such as forklifts, cranes, and container handlers.

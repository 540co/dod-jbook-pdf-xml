            "val": "Trusted Information System (TIS) Radiant Mercury (RM) system provides the core on-line, automated guarding, sanitization, and transliteration services that provides the United State Navy (USN)'s primary command and control systems with the capability to move data between multiple security domains.  RM is a critical component in a wide variety of Navy architectures to include Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise Services (CANES) and the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC). RM supports numerous programs to include the Navy's Automated Identification System (AIS),  Global Command Control Systems-Maritime (GCCS-M), Distributed Common Ground System-Navy (DCGS-N), and Navy Tactical Ranges, Naval Modular Automated Communications System (NAVMACS), and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). RM architecture provides the capability to move data between security domains in order to maintain Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and effectively share information. As the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for RM the USN also maintains the RM development team, Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) team, and test facilities for both the DoD and the Intelligence Community. RM is deployed at over 380 sites worldwide with approximately 600 fielded systems. Funds continuous hardware tech refresh at the prime developer and at certification test locations.\n\nFunding in FY17 and out was realigned to OMN AGSAG 1C1C due to the increased level of national-level Cybersecurity certification and accreditation requirements."

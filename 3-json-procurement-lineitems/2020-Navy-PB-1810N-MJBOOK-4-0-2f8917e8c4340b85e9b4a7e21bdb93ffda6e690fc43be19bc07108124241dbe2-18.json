Includes the Navy Enterprise Tactical Command and Control (NETC2) (V)1 and (V)2, Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures (ExMCM) and Assured Command and Control (AC2) in support of outfitting Table of Allowances (TOA) equipment requirements within Expeditionary Forces. Ensures requirements are addressed through a process where common C4I solution are being developed, procured, integrated, coordinated, tracked, and fielded across Navy Expeditionary Forces (NEF), both Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC).\n\n[P5 \/ Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) Kits]: Per USCYBERCOM DMSS System Requirements Document V1.0, each Cyber Protection Team (CPT) must be provisioned with 2 Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) to support two simultaneous team deployments (40 total). The CPTs primary mission is to Survey, Secure, and Protect military networks (aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide) which necessitates onsite vulnerability assessments and incident response on little to no notice.  Field deployable computing assets for the 20 Navy CPTs are required to allow globally deployable teams to conduct intensive, computationally-heavy analysis when reach-back capability is unavailable or bandwidth is limited.  In addition, Navy CPTs located in CONUS will be required to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into theater to support C4F, C5F, C6F and C7F mission assurance objectives to include identification of cyber key terrain and Operation Plan (OPLAN) development."

A total of three (3) NETC2 systems will be procured in FY 20.\n\nFunds for Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) kits were realigned from budget line item 8106 to a Cyber Pure budget line item 8120 which ensures compliance with FY 2017 Appropriations Act. DMSS kits are required for each Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) to support simultaneous deployments.

The CPTs primary mission is to Survey, Secure, and Protect military networks (aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide) which necessitates onsite vulnerability assessments and incident response on little to no notice.  Field deployable computing assets for the 20 Navy CPTs are required to allow deployable teams to conduct intensive, computationally-heavy analysis when reach-back capability is unavailable or bandwidth is limited.  In addition, Navy CPTs located in CONUS will be required to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into theater to support C4F, C5F, and C6F mission assurance objectives to include identification of cyber key terrain and Operation Plan (OPLAN) development.  The DMSS installations are simple modifications and have no installation costs associated since the work will be performed at the Navy organizational level.",

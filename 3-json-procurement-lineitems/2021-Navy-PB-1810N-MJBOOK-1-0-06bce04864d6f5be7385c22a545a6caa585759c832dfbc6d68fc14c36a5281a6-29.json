        "Description": {
            "val": "The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies, and protection of the environment.\n\nThe APD increase was necessary in order to regain the original procurement objective schedule after production delays caused by engineering changes required to accommodate the COLUMBIA class of submarines and technical delays related to issues with subcontractor components.  \n\nIncreases in quantities of the Radiological Detection System (RDS) have also occurred in this budget, due to the realignment of funds previously budgeted for the Mk2 Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD).  The vendor for the EPD defaulted on its projections for the final production run of the EPD, freeing up approximately $2.5M that was applied to RDS in 2020-2022.  This increase will enhance the ability to meet the procurement objective for RDS.\n\n[P40A \/ M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters, required by 10 CFR 20 and the Navy's mission, are used to detect, measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors, maintenance on radioactive systems or components, testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray), research, and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally, radiation survey meters are used to search for, locate and intercept radioactive material, and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material, they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.\n\n[P40A \/ Radiological Detection System]: M2100, Radiological Detection System (RDS):  This is a basic RADIAC instrument used in Consequence Management and Occupational Safety and Health applications by all ships (U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command) and shore commands.  It is used to survey for radioactive surface contamination pursuant to nuclear plant operations or nuclear plant maintenance; following medical procedures involving radioactive isotopes; or casualties and events that release radioactivity into the environment such as after a nuclear reactor accident or the use of weapons involving nuclear devices or radioactivity.  It is also used to perform surveys for various types of radiation in order to monitor environmental conditions in areas and spaces immediately adjacent to where radioactive material is stored or used during routine operations; where nuclear plant operations occur; and where radioisotopes are used for maintenance, such as during industrial radiography operations.\n\nThe RDS consists of a Control Unit and a suite of probes that survey for different types of radioactivity (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Neutron).  Also part of the procurement will be various types of connecting cables; carrying cases; telescoping handles; and three specialty probes.  The Control Unit is necessary for all applications while the probes are used for different applications.  That means the Control Unit will have the highest procurement objective and the probes and ancillary equipment will be bought in varying quantities.  \n\nThis instrument will replace the Navy's 30-year old IM-265\/PDQ Multi-Function RADIAC Control Unit and its probes.  The RDS is being developed by the Joint Product Leader for Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPdL-RND) in order that the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force (and some NATO allies) will all have a Joint instrument that will enable interoperability and surge support of assets from all the components to forward deployed units in a theater of operations where a radiological event arises.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt, on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. \n\nIn accordance with 10 CFR 20, dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.\n\n[P40A \/ DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200, DT-702 Card Holder:  A plastic case into which the DT-702 card is placed for the card's protection and so it can be worn on a lanyard or on a belt.  It has four circular windows made of specific materials of various thickness to allow the proper filtration of radiation to the dosimeter elements under each of the windows.\n\n[P40A \/ Extremity Dosimeter]: M2200, Extremity Dosimeter:  An extremity dosimeter is used to measure concentrated exposure to the hands when a radiation worker is reaching into a glove box or medical personnel are performing fluoroscopy tasks.  This item is composed of three inexpensive pieces:  1) a plastic ring ($2) to wear on a finger; 2) a dosimeter ($36) that measures exposure; and 3) a cap that secures the dosimeter to the ring.  The cap is made to a specific thickness depending on the type of radiation the dosimeter is intended to measure ($3).  These items will be procured in quantities of 3,000 each.  An average unit cost for the three items is used and all 9,000 components are shown on this one Cost Element.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter:  The Accident Dosimeter is a passive type nuclear dosimeter capable of detecting and recording fast neutron radiation exposures. These dosimeters are used to determine radiation dose to the crew in the event of an accident affecting operation of a nuclear reactor.  These dosimeters are fastened near or adjacent to reactor compartments on all Navy submarines and carriers.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter High Purity Germanium  Detector]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter High Purity Germanium Detector:  The portable High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector is used to measure the photon radiation emitting from the dosimeter as a result of the reactor accident. This instrument is used at the Naval Dosimetry Center to evaluate the results of an accident.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter Alpha\/Beta Detector]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter Alpha\/Beta Detector:  The portable Alpha\/Beta Detector is used to measure the alpha and beta radiation emitting from the dosimeter as a result of a reactor accident.  This instrument is used at the Naval Dosimetry Center to evaluate the results of an accident.\n\n[P40A \/ Accident Dosimeter Data & Training]: M2200, Accident Dosimeter Data & Training:  The Naval Dosimetry Center staff will be trained on how to evaluate the dosimeter.  The vendor will supply Technical Manuals, Technical Repair Standards and Standard Calibration Procedure documentation in order for the detectors purchased to be maintained by Navy Radiation Calibration Laboratories.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter:  A dosimeter designed for use during nuclear or radiological events involving high energy gamma and neutron irradiation.  An \"event\" can be a nuclear reactor accident, such as the Fukushima disaster in 2011, or an attack on, e.g., a Carrier Strike Group using a nuclear or radiological (dirty bomb) weapon.  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP (Military Operational Posture) III to allow the commander to manage the exposure received by members of recovery teams who would be deployed in order to maintain continuity of operations.  It is also used to perform triage on casualties, allowing medical personnel to most effectively allocate their resources.\n\n[P40A \/ Battlefield Dosimeter Cases]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter Cases:  The Battlefield Dosimeter will spend much of its time aboard ships stored in Damage Control Lockers.  The instrument will also have to be shipped to and from a RADIAC Calibration Laboratory to undergo periodic calibrations.  Because allowances for the instruments on the various ship classes range from 12 on an LCS to 700 each on a CVN, cases configured to hold different quantities (25, 50, 100) will be procured to afford the necessary protection for storage and shipping while maximizing shipboard storage space efficiency.\n\n[P40A \/ Electronic Personal Dosimeter]: M2200, Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD):  An electronic dosimeter that includes a real-time digital display of radiation dose being received.  These so-called secondary dosimeters are normally used in conjunction with the DT-702 primary dosimeter in order to provide the wearer with real-time radiation dose information and alarm features that aid workers in controlling their radiation exposure.  The DT-702 (Cost Element 2.1) is the Navy's approved dosimeter to record dose of record in each individual's medical record, but it is a \"passive\" device; i.e., it does not immediately display the dose being received.  Instead, the dose is stored on the card on four different elements. It must be turned in and read by a machine (the 8800 Reader), a process that takes weeks, and therefore does not indicate if the wearer is in imminent danger.\n\n[P40A \/ M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The contract officer for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF)activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee(s) for a given year are applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2400 - Other RADIAC]: M2400.  Other RADIAC.  The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  The M2400 Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality with which they could be grouped.\n\nThis Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.\n\n[P40A \/ Spares]: M2400, Spares:  Purchase of additional quantities of existing models of RADIACs to replenish or supplement stocks of items due to minor increases in program allowances, inventory losses, or due to assets being beyond economical repair.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: M2500.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.\nFixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Detector (APD) Ship Frames]: M2500, Air Particle Detector (APD), Ship, Frames:  In accordance with the referenced standard, the currently fielded IM-239\/WDQ frames and some specific components are Restored, which is defined in the reference as making the equipment \". . . conform to the current technical specifications for the item . . . and the restoration of the equipment's physical appearance to the manufacturer's original condition (like new).\"  The Government provides these units as Government Furnished Property (GFP) to the vendor building the IM-272\/WDQ APD, into which they build and install modern components.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship:  Airborne radioactivity monitoring system that is required for use on CVNs and all submarines.   This system (IM-272A\/WDQ) is a replacement for the existing IM-239\/WDQ used on all Navy submarines and carriers.   The IM-272A\/WDQ incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Conversion]: M2500, APD Ship Conversion:  Under the new contract awarded in September 2019, 10 of the 30 IM-272\/WDQ units procured in FY17 will be converted to the IM-272A\/WDQ to enable them to be fielded.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Data]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Data:  Technical Manuals for the operation and preventive maintenance of the equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Provisioning]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Provisioning:  In June 2019 the APD Ship Configuration Audit will validate the \"as-built\" production unit against the Technical Data Package.  The audit will also verify compliance with the Performance and Testing Specification.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship GFP Repair by Contractor]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship GFP Repair by Contractor:  The APD Ship utilizes GFP in its design.  The Government prepares the GFP prior to shipment to the contractor.  Certain pieces require additional repair work by the contractor.  The Government will fund the contractor to repair GFP as needed in order to mitigate risks to cost and schedule.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Drawing Revisions]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Drawing Revisions:  The Government is providing the Technical Data Package (TDP) to the contractor to build the APD Ship.  The contractor may identify issues with the TDP that need to be resolved prior to manufacturing the assemblies and subassemblies within the APD.  The Government will assess whether the issues require adjudication prior to production.  The contractor will be funded to correct these issues upon contract award.\n\n[P40A \/ APD Ship Program Reviews]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Program Reviews:  The contractor will host quarterly program reviews during the life of the contract, to be conducted at the contractor's site. The contractor will brief topics to include, but not limited to, testing and manufacturing issues, Government Furnished Property (GFP) usage, and the milestone plan. Risks to the schedule and the corresponding risk mitigation methods shall be discussed. The contractor will make a teleconference line available for individuals not able to attend the review in person.\n\n[P40A \/ Air Particle Sampler]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler:  Portable airborne radioactivity sampling system.  Used during radiological work or during radiological casualties to draw air across a filter paper to collect radioactive particles.  The filter paper is then evaluated using separately provided radiation detectors to determine the concentration of airborne radioactivity.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor]: M2500, Tritium Monitor:  The AN\/PDR-73 Tritium Monitor is used at nuclear weapons storage facilities and research laboratories to sample the air for the presence of tritium, which is a toxic radiation hazard if inhaled. It is 30 years old and cannot be repaired due to obsolete components. At the current loss rate due to normal wear and tear there will be insufficient assets to meet operational requirements, so a replacement must be procured.\n\n[P40A \/ Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts & Training]: M2500, Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts & Training:  Electro Magnetic Interference testing, Testing Manuals, Technical Repair Standard.  Training of RADIAC Calibration Laboratory electronic technicians and program engineers on how to maintain the equipment.\n\n[P40A \/ M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The contract officer for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF)activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee(s) for a given year are applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment]: M2600.  This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and test facilities.  This kind of equipment is distinct enough to warrant separating it for management purposes from the M2400 Cost Code.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrators]: M2600, Calibrators:  Calibrators (also known as irradiators) are the basic tool used to calibrate all Navy radiological detection equipment.  They consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed and shielded room, or \"range.\" A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that the radiological source becomes exposed and it irradiates the instrument. The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrator, No Source]: M2600, Calibrator, No Source:  This unit will be located at the lead RADIAC Calibration Laboratory where technicians and engineers will be trained on calibrator maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair without requiring the constraints of exercising radiation exposure controls.\n\n[P40A \/ Calibrator Initial Spare Parts, Installation & Training]: M2600, Calibrator Initial Spare Parts, Installation & Training:  Initial spare parts and vendor training at each of the seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories where the equipment will be installed.  The vendor will ship and install the calibrators at each of the seven Navy RADIAC Calibration Laboratories.\n\n[P40A \/ Liquid Scintillation Counter]: M2600, Liquid Scintillation Counter:  The primary radioisotope of concern at nuclear weapons storage facilities is tritium (H-3), which presents itself in particulate and gaseous form.  To monitor facilities for particulate tritium, radiological \"swipes\" are collected from various surfaces and then analyzed in a LSC to measure a representative amount of any contamination present.  The LSC is calibrated to detect radiation with energies that match the isotopes of interest. The procurement cost represents the cost of the instruments and associated peripherals and software.\n\n[P40A \/ TS-4575\/FDM Calibrator]: M2600, TS-4575\/FDM Calibrator:  This system will be used to calibrate the IM-276\/PD and IM-276A\/PD Battlefield Dosimeters.  In 2021, two new units will be procured.  In 2022, the unit procured in 2019 as an RDT&E article for testing and further development of the device will be back-fitted as necessary in order to convert it into an updated, operational unit.  The calibrators will be fielded to a Navy RCL on each coast, and the third to the Pearl Harbor RCL.\n\n[P40A \/ TS-4575\/FDM Parts & Training]: M2600, TS-4575\/FDM Parts & Training:  Initial spare parts, equipment, and training of RADIAC calibration technicians at the seven Navy RCLs on its operation and preventive maintenance.\n\n[P40A \/ M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The contract officer for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF)activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee(s) for a given year are applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 - Support - Production Engineering]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government and contractor personnel who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering Carderock]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ Production Engineering ISEA]: M2830, Production Engineering In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA):  Labor cost of the contractor Engineers, Logisticians, Technical Writer, Program Analyst, and Systems Analysts who help prepare the acquisitions.\n\n[P40A \/ M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The contract officer for service contracts is a Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF)activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the contract action."

            "val": "Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or who are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction to locate or intercept WMD)."

Quantities required for each of the line items will also vary widely, from five Scintillation Probes to approximately 9,681 Control Units.  To keep this exhibit simple, the quantities provided in each year will be a combination of several of the line items in various configurations.  This also means that the unit cost year-to-year is not based on inflation of any specific end item, but rather a reflection of the various line items being procured that year in their various quantities and widely varying costs.     Quantity increases have been achieved in this budget due to realignment of $7.9M in FYs 2022-2025 from the APD Ship cost element (M2500) due to the latter's new (awarded September 2019) contract pricing that came in much lower than previously estimated unit costs.",

To fill the gap, specifications for a new BD included dose received at occupational levels and real-time feedback for the wearer's situational awareness.  Due to recent adjustments in the quantities needed as spares and in reserve, the procurement objective has been reduced from 75,000 units to 62,000, which will be achieved in 2021.  The quantities previously shown in 2020 and 2021 have been reduced to accommodate the objective.",

The Navy had been allotted and subsequently budgeted for 5,000 units.  However, during the production run so many units failed testing and because spare parts were unavailable and the vendor not willing to procure additional parts, the Navy's allotment was reduced by the vendor to 700 units.  Therefore the procurement of 1,000 in 2020 has been reduced accordingly and the planned procurements in 2021 and 2022 for 2,000 units in each year have been removed from the budget and the available $2.5M realigned into the Radiological Detection System line item.",

The unit cost came in significantly lower than the pricing previously being used to project cost.  This contract also contained six levels of stepladder pricing from 25 to a maximum of 80 units per CLIN.  Both outcomes provided the ability to allow procurement to complete within the term of the new contract in 2023, thereby regaining the original procurement schedule after a two-year production hiatus for an engineering change request to accommodate COLUMBIA class submarine noise reduction requirements, and technical issues with a supplier of pumps for the unit.  FY18 and FY19 fuds were used to make the award in September 2019, so the prior year and FY19 quantities were adjusted accordingly.  The procurement objective of 338 units is unchanged, but the OPN objective has been reduced to 301 units because 27 are projected to be procured with SCN.",

The dosimeter must be checked and calibrated every three years in order to ensure it is operating within specifications.  Because there will be over 58,000 dosimeters fielded, a device that can service them efficiently is needed in order to ensure the throughput at the servicing RADIAC Calibration Laboratory (RCL) can keep up with the operational tempo, and to reduce total ownership costs by automating the entire process and therefore reducing labor costs.  This device will be able to process 200 units per eight hour shift, as opposed to a manual process that would involve irradiating at most 30 units at a time, but then requiring a technician to hook up each unit individually to a computer for verification and other testing, which would equate to a throughput of at most two batches (60 units) during the same eight hour work shift, and more likely only one batch of 30 completed and half the process completed for the second batch.",

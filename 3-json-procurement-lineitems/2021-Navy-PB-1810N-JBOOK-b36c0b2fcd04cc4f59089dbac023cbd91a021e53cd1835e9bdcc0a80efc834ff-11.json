            "val": "This line provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment.  Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.\n\n[P40A \/ SURFACE TRAINING ADVANCED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (STAVE) SEAFRAME SIMULATORS]: STAVE-LCS SEAFRAME SIMULATORS - Funds procure Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) tactical training simulators and equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) in Newport, Rhode Island. Simulators meet the Train to Qualify\/ Train to Certify (T2Q\/T2C) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Funding procures hardware and software associated with building the trainers and the installation of this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) in each homeport and at SWOS enabling the increased throughput for ships\/crew\/sailors supporting CNO approved BLUE GOLD Plus crewing strategy and directly supporting the revised training requirements of the Navy's Comprehensive Review. This procurement enables ship Commanding Officers to witness watch stander crew performance under high-stress conditions given realistic at sea scenarios in the synthetic environment. Trainers are required for each ship variant, located in the San Diego and Mayport homeports and at SWOS. Throughput of LCS crews requires more than one simulator of each variant in a homeport.\n\n1.1) STAVE-LCS Virtual Reality Labs & Networks and Modernization - Funds comprehensive network infrastructure and computing environment and Virtual Reality Labs (VRLs), within the LCS Training Facilities (LTF) to support delivery and management of all components of LCS watch stander training. This modernization enables enhanced warfighter scenario training for the LCS crews in Combat Systems qualifications and ship systems troubleshooting, through the virtual network, without which, no systems within the LTF (currently built in San Diego, and being built in Mayport) will interoperate or communicate with each other.  Both LTFs are being designed around a central computer server farm (backbone) that houses all courseware, training scenarios, and student records.  Without the STAVE-Net infrastructure, there is no way to distribute the required courseware and software around the LTF. Without the VRLs, there is no method of presenting previously developed STAVE courseware to students. Modernization efforts include regular\/scheduled updates\/upgrades to the STAVE Network and include procurement of new servers, relays, and switches, along with the procurement of replacement Virtual Reality Lab (electronic classroom) equipment supporting increased crew throughput.\n\n1.2) STAVE-LCS Mission Bay Trainers & Modernization - Enable the qualification, training, and team certification of the individuals and teams deploying the LCS main battery - Mission Packages (MP).  Live scenarios include prepping and launching\/recovering of multi-ton mission module off-hull remote vehicles and operating of the internal cranes, doors, and other associated equipment in the Mission Bay.  Modernizations provide updated MP deployment and recovery capability for enhanced warfighting readiness the individual full-scale replicas of the Mission Bay for both variants.  Without the Mission Bay Trainer, there will be no realistic controlled scenario homeport training in the Mission Bay operations for the San Diego or Mayport-based crews and detachments during training pipeline, or off-hull, rapid refresh crew team training, and the primary warfare area (the Mission Bay) for the LCS ships will have no shore-based, controlled training capability in San Diego and Mayport, in this high-risk area of Mission Bay operations.\n\n1.3) STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers & ITT Modernization - These are full scale simulators of the Tactical Software enabling, initial and proficiency, integrated team training of Bridge, Combat Systems, Engineering, and Mission Package systems\/watch stations. The ITT delivers Detect to Engage sequencing of ships Combat Systems and developing watch stander Command and Control for our future Navy warfighters. The quantity and type (based on variant) of trainers in San Diego and Mayport is dependent on the Navy's Strategic Laydown of the Littoral Combat Ships. Follow on ITT procurements will include integrated crew served weapon simulators (discussed below). Modernization to the ITT's enable ships baseline upgrades and realistic combat scenarios compatible with individual crew Combat System baseline to prepare crews for in Battle Force training. Without the ITTs, there is no way for the LCS crews and detachments to train in-port, as the LCS ships do not have an onboard training system requirement. Ships would have to train underway utilizing real targets and other Fleet assets, such as drones, and commercial air services to accomplish required qualifications and certifications for all of their training.  The LCS Concept of Operations does not support such at-sea intensive training requirements. \n\n1.4) STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers \/ Combat & Engineering Systems: Procurement of Maintenance Execution Team (MET) devices, and procurement installation of 7\/11 Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) simulation systems.\n\n1.5) STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactics Trainer Complete System - Procurement of the complete trainer to include Bridge Training System, Combats Training System and Engineering Training System.\n\n1.6)  STAVE-LCS Bridge Trainers and Modernization - Devices that permit selected aspects of Bridge tasks (including Readiness Control Officer [RCO] tasks) to be practiced independently of Combat Systems Operations as found in more capable ITTs. This facilitates more efficient accomplishment of T2Q and T2C objectives. This trainer supports Officer training pipeline at SWOS, Newport in support of Division Officer, Department Head, and PXO\/PCO training pipeline for Officer of the Deck Training and rapid refresh and skills enhancement in Mayport.\n\n1.7) STAVE-LCS Tactical Action Officer Trainers Modernization - Modernization efforts include upgrades to the trainers through procurement of new servers, relays and switches as well as new consoles, joysticks and communication equipment. \n\n1.8) STAVE-LCS Combat Systems Part Task Trainers (C2 PTT) (LCS 1 and LCS 2) .  These devices permit training in selected aspects of Combat Systems Operations that are found in the more capable ITTs, to support individual skills development and practice, reduce the wear and tear on the ITTs, and allow the ITTs to more efficiently accommodate team training and certifications.\n\n[P40A \/ STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers \/ Combats & Engineering Systems]: STAVE-LCS Integrated Tactical Trainers \/ Combat & Engineering Systems: Procurement of Maintenance Execution Team (MET) devices, and procurement and installation of 7\/11M Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) simulation systems.\n\n[P40A \/ Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT) to Sea]: Investment provides updates to the Combined Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Trainer (CIAT) to establish a foundation for bringing this capability to AEGIS and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Baselines for ship integration to provide live, virtual, constructive (LVC) training in a contested environment. Investment will enable 27 additional platforms to train to their ships capabilities in realistic environments against peer\/near peer threats.  This will provide high fidelity LVC capability at sea and enables needed training capability for Sailors to employ the weapon system against peer threats during AWT Phase II, and enables AEGIS Training and Readiness Command, as part of a larger strategy, to meet training production for Fire Controlman, Sonarman and Officers.\nFunds also include costs associated with tactical and other software licensing, Information Assurance, computer program procurements and patches to ensure alignment with DON CIO Cyber requirements and ship tactical modernization.

            "val": "The FY 2021 funding request for the Surface Training Advanced Virtual Environment (STAVE) Seaframe Simulators reflects modernization, and upgrades to existing ITTs, Bridge Part Task Trainers (BPTTs), and Virtual Reality Laboratories (VRLs).\n\nThe FY21 increase in funding growth for BFTT supports the delivery and sustainment of distributed STAVE-CS hardware suites for maintaining training for over 10,000 students and Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) hardware for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capabilities to meet Strike Group Training Requirements, and delivery capability to enable at sea training. Increased FY 2021 funding in the amount of $12.35M for Surface Training Advanced Virtual Environment (STAVE) infrastructure for the procurement of maintenance and operator training equipment, materials, and visuals for operation.  This requirement will provide increased student throughput, and gain efficiencies by enabling courses to be centrally conducted and distributed to remote classrooms located in fleet concentration areas. Combined IAMD\/ASW Trainer (CIAT) to Sea decrease of $15.5M from FY20 to FY21 is in accordance with the budget requested for STAVE-CS. FY20 funding is for the procurement of trainers and classroom infrastructure upgrade materials.  The reduced amount of FY21 funding is for the installation of these trainers and class room infrastructure upgrades. \n\n\nThe phasing of the CVN 78 Class training equipment is based on achieving Ready for Training (RFT) dates for various shipboard systems based on system complexity and procurement lead times, which is aligned to the CVN 78 deployment ready status and the INITIAL training requirements of the CVN 79 Crew.\n\nFY21 funding for Surface Training Device Modifications decreased by $21.924M in accordance with Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan (SEWTP) requirements planned for the fiscal year. This program provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment. Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the SEWTP. Funding decreased in FY21 due to the fact that significant investments were made in FY20 for Navigation, Seamanship, and Ship-handling Trainers (NSST), and fewer procurements are planned for FY21 ($-11.7M). Funding also decreased in response to the number of formal courses of instruction that will require NTSP updates during the fiscal year ($-8.5M), as well as the planned completion of the DDG & CG HM&E Modernization Training effort ($-8.9M). While overall program funding decreased for Surface Training Device Modifications, FY21 funding increased for the following efforts, in order to support Fleet readiness and ensure that sailors are properly trained to operate and maintain mission critical systems and effectively execute their missions: 1) Surface Minor Modifications - FY21 funding is required to support an increase in SEWTP requirements including funding for Surface Training Readiness Management Systems (STRMS) ($6.512M); and 2) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Firefighter Trainer (FFT) - FY21 funding is required as Firefighter Trainers are reaching the end of their life expectancy and more extensive SLEP tasks are needed to extend the life expectancy of the trainers to support the fleet ($0.7M).\n\n\nSHIP TO SHORE CONNECTOR (SSC) FULL MISSION TRAINERS (FMT) - Program has requirements for two FMTs, which are programmable simulators and is a fundamental element of SSC operator training.  New SSC FMTs are required because LCAC FMTs will not support SSC crew training based on significant Command Module\/C4N System differences.

These modifications support the 200+ fielded Surface training systems and support fleet training requirements as dictated by the SEWTP. Funding supports Fleet Training Wholeness requirements in support of a DON-directed deep dive to develop alternatives to improve the Navy's competitive advantage via high-end training, including the Air Defense Strike Group Facility (ADSGF)\/Integrated Training Facility (ITF) surface capability in Fallon, NV. Without this ADSGF\/ITF surface capability, there is no way to train Carrier Strike Groups on high-end threats and capabilities related to Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA). Funding also supports Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Tactical Trainers, enabling advanced ASW training for Officers and Sailors. Funding also supports DDG 1000 Wholeness\/Surface Strike Implementation to fund the execution of Navy Training System Plan requirements for the acquisition of life cycle training solutions to include operator and maintenance training on associated DDG 1000 unique Hull, Mechanical and Electrical Systems and Combat Control Systems.

                        "val": "The Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT)\/Advanced Training Domain (ATD)\/Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) family of systems provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict; realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas; a means to link ships together which are in different homeports for coordinated training; external stimulation of shipboard training systems; and simulation of non-shipboard forces. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT uses a distributed architecture, integrating existing training systems, and uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Strike Group\/Battle Force (SG\/BF) Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Groups (ATGs), the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Training (FSTs)\/Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) exercises. The Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) integrates existing and emergent onboard training and assessment system capabilities to simulate realistic, \"train like you fight\", combat-like conditions across weapon sensor and combat systems. Migration to TSTC improvements is required to ensure continued, persistent FST\/LVC interoperability to deliver training that is commensurate with tactical capabilities. Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Obsolescence mitigates replacement and upgrade of obsolete and out-of-production COTS components in BFTT systems installed throughout the Fleet to include the AN\/USQ-T46D upgrade. BFTT T46D and ATD\/T52 are core components of the TSTC.\n\nBFTT T46D Ship set configurations vary depending on AEGIS or Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) installation.  T46D's for SSDS include additional materials and units to be integrated for stimulation of the ships sensors.\n\nTSTC\/ATD\/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure T46D's and T52's and subsequent variants of hardware and software for Build 5.x series in support of AN\/SQQ-89 upgrades, AN\/SLQ-32(V)6 upgrades, AN\/USG-2B upgrades, and ATD software builds in support of AEGIS Baseline 9 TI-16 upgrades and SSDS upgrades -- which drives the difference in unit cost. Installation funding supports installation of (17) BFTT AN\/USQ-T46D Systems.  Additional costs will be incurred to procure more materials needed to meet integrated CEC training requirements, cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) to meet shipboard integrated training demands."

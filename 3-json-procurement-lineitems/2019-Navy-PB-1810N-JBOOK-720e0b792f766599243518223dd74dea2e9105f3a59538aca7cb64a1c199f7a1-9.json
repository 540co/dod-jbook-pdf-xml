            "val": "The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by ($0.68) million to reflect the Department of Navy's effort to support the Office of Management and Budget directed reforms for Efficiency and Effectiveness that include a lean, accountable, more efficient government.\n\nFY 2019 funding provides the Fleet with the required training equipment for the respective LCS homeports and the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS). Training equipment is required to satisfy the Train to Qualify Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirement of the Capabilities Development Document. Required procurements of hardware and software associated with building the trainers and installing this hardware and software at the LCS Training Facilities in each homeport and at SWOS. Trainers are required for both of the ship variants.\n\nThe Integrated Tactics Trainers (ITTs) will be procured in FY19 for delivery in FY21. Without the installation of these trainers, the Training throughput capacity at Mayport and San Diego LTF's will be exceeded and sailors will be unable to be trained using the blue\/gold crewing model prior to being stationed onboard the Littoral Combat Ships. Without the training, sailors will be unable to safely operate the equipment onboard ships, thus potentially putting the safety of those sailors, damage to equipment, and the mission of the ship, at significant risk. \n\nThe Bridge Part Task Trainers (BPTTs) provide valuable training to the sailors. Modernization is required because these Trainers have not been upgraded since installation. Without the modernization of these trainers, in accordance with SWOS analysis, sailors will be forced to use outdated equipment\/technology that may fail, have to be restarted numerous times, or repaired prior to being able to train LCS crew. Without the training, sailors will be unable to safely operate the equipment onboard ships, thus potentially putting the safety of those sailors, and the mission of the ship, at significant risk. \n\nThe increase in BFTT ship sets being procured and installed in FY19 is necessary to meet the requirement to rapidly update installations to meet cyber security requirements and timelines to maintain cybersecurity accreditations.\n\nThe phasing of this requirement is based on achieving Ready for Training (RFT) dates for various shipboard systems in FY 19-21 based on system complexity and procurement lead times, which is aligned to the CVN78 deployment ready status and the INITIAL training requirements of the CVN79 Crew.\n\nThe FY19 funding for Surface Training Device Modifications provides funding to procure, modify, and upgrade training devices to keep them compatible with equivalent changes made to Fleet operational equipment. Funds ensure alignment between Surface Learning Centers and Fleet Concentration Area training systems and Fleet training requirements as dictated by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Plan.  Increased funding is required in FY19 for the following efforts, in order to support Fleet readiness and ensure that sailors are properly trained to operate and maintain mission critical systems and effectively execute their missions:  1) Navigation Training Support for the modernization of all Surface Navigation, Seamanship, and Ship-handling Trainers (NSST) in all CONUS and OCONUS Fleet Concentration Areas as well as various schoolhouse locations, in support of the Comprehensive Review - Implementation of Surface Warfare Recommendations; 2) Procurement and installation of an In-Plant Support System (IPSS) for the Aegis Ashore Team Trainer (AATT), in support of the AEGIS Ashore Poland training capacity; 3) An increased number of formal courses of instruction requiring NTSP updates in order to reflect current Fleet configurations; 4) DDG & CG BMD 4.X\/HM&E Modernization Training - Two Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) 4.0 training labs as well as Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) training equipment for the schoolhouses in support of new BMD capabilities as well as new HM&E systems resulting from Cruiser\/Destroyer modernization and new construction deliveries; 5) Procurement and installation of MK57 Mod 12\/15 NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System (NSSMS) training and technical equipment in the schoolhouse; 6) Fleet Training Wholeness (FTW) 2025 and Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) training requirements for the Air Defense Strike Group Facility (ADSGF)\/Integrated Training Facility (ITF) surface capability; and 7) DDG 1000 Wholeness\/Surface Strike Implementation, to fund the execution of Navy Training System Plan requirements for the acquisition of life cycle training solutions to include operator and maintenance training on associated DDG 1000 unique Hull, Mechanical and Electrical Systems and Combat Control Systems.\n\nNAVIGATION TRAINING SUPPORT - Funds are provided for modifications\/upgrades to Navigation Shore Based Trainers, to support the modernization of all Surface Navigation, Seamanship, and Ship-handling Trainers (NSST) in all CONUS and OCONUS Fleet Concentration Areas as well as various schoolhouse locations. Modernization is critical to maintaining trainer service life and avoiding increased costs to maintain aging equipment. Per the DON directed Comprehensive Review - Implementation of Surface Warfare Recommendations, the increase in FY19 funding is in response to directives to provide an integrated NSST and Combat Information Center (CIC) training capability and will result in additional training system  modifications\/upgrades commencing in FY19.\n\nAEGIS ASHORE TRAINER\/C4I\/Tech Refresh -Funds modernization, delivery, installation and life-cycle upgrades for a high fidelity Aegis Ashore Team Trainer in support of the land-based Aegis Ashore Training Continuum.  Funds also provide for the integration of a C4I component, BMD Upgrades, and tech refresh.  Also funds the training facility to train Navy Sailors who will man EPAA land-based BMD facilities in Poland and Romania. The Aegis Ashore Team Trainer (AATT) at Dam Neck, VA will serve as the single site for individual watch team tactical training, certification events and sustainment training for Aegis Ashore rotational crews assigned to AA BMD Host Nation Sites.  Increased funding in FY19 is required for the procurement and installation of an In-Plant Support System (IPSS) for the AATT. The AATT in Dam Neck is the only means of training and certifying crews prior to arriving at their host nation site. As an alternative to funding a second AATT, this IPSS will allow for IA and some maintenance to be conducted separate from the AATT, freeing time to train at the Dam Neck facility and supporting Poland coming online.\n\nNAVY TRAINING SYSTEM PLAN (NTSP Technical Training Equipment (TTE)\/Training Device (TD) Mods) - Funds are provided for the procurement and installation of training equipment and associated logistic support package as outlined in the NTSPs.  The increase in FY19 funding is in response to the number of formal courses of instruction that will require NTSP updates in order to reflect current Fleet configurations.  Six (6) courses are being revised in FY19, compared to three (3) courses being revised in FY18.  Additionally, the FY19 course updates have a broader scope and require additional resources. Failure to update these courses will decrease sailors ability to operate and maintain these critical systems, hindering ships from effectively executing missions and negatively impacting Fleet readiness.\n\nDDG & CG BMD 4.X\/HM&E MODERNIZATION TRAINING - FY19 funding supports two Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) 4.0 training labs as well as Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) training equipment for the schoolhouses in support of new BMD capabilities as well as new HM&E systems resulting from Cruiser\/Destroyer modernization and new construction deliveries.  Without this equipment, there is no way for the Navy to train Sailors and Officers to operate and maintain the new BMD and HM&E systems.\n\nNATO SEASPARROW SURFACE MISSILE SYSTEM (NSSMS) SCHOOLHOUSE TRAINER - FY19 funding supports the procurement and installation of MK57 Mod 12\/15 NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System (NSSMS) training and technical equipment in the schoolhouse.  The MK57 Mod 12\/15 is already installed on 23 ships. The current NSSMS schoolhouse trainer is the antiquated MK2 which is no longer common with the Fleet system, resulting in schoolhouse training for approximately 400 Sailors achieving just 10% of course objectives relative to the MK57 Mod 12\/15. Without the MK57 Mod 12\/15 NSSMS training and technical equipment there is no way to ensure that sailors are properly trained on how to operate and maintain the current MK57 Mod 12\/15 NSSMS.  Note: There is no Ready Relevant Learning (RRL) solution able to substitute for this training requirement.\n\nDDG 1000 WHOLENESS\/SURFACE STRIKE - FY19 funding will procure shipboard connectivity suites (SCS) for installation aboard the DDG 1000 ships.  The SCS units are required to establish network communications between the DDG 1000 embedded training system and the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) in support of pier-side Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events.  FST events are conducted by the fleet to certify crew, ship and strike groups prior to deployment.\n\nSHIP TO SHORE CONNECTOR (SSC) FULL MISSION TRAINERS (FMT) - Funds SSC FMT which is a programmable simulator and is a fundamental element of SSC operator training.  New SSC FMTs are required because LCAC FMTs will not support SSC crew training based on significant Command Module\/C4N System differences. Note: This item was previously housed in LI 0970 and was moved to LI 5664."

                        "val": "The Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT)\/Advanced Training Domain (ATD)\/Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) family of systems provides realistic joint warfare training across the spectrum of armed conflict; realistic unit level team training in all warfare areas; a means to link ships together which are in different homeports for coordinated training; external stimulation of shipboard training systems; and simulation of non-shipboard forces. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT uses a distributed architecture, integrating existing training systems, and uses Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) protocols. TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT provides ships' Commanding Officers and Strike Group\/Battle Force (SG\/BF) Commanders with the ability to conduct coordinated realistic, high stress, combat system level team training as an integral part of the Afloat Training Groups (ATGs), the Tactical Training Groups and C2F\/C3F Fleet Synthetic Training (FSTs)\/Live Virtual Constuctive (LVC) exercises. The Total Ship Training Capability (TSTC) integrates existing and emergent onboard training and assessment system capabilities to simulate realistic, \"train like you fight\", combat-like conditions across weapon sensor and combat systems. Migration to TSTC improvements is required to ensure continued, persistent FST\/LVC interoperability to deliver training that is commensurate with tactical capabilities. Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Obsolescence mitigates replacement and upgrade of obsolete and out-of-production COTS components in BFTT systems installed throughout the Fleet to include the AN\/USQ-T46D upgrade. BFTT T46D and ATD\/T52 are core components of the TSTC.\n\nBFTT T46D Ship set configurations vary depending on AEGIS or Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) installation.  T46D's for SSDS include additional materials and units to be integrated for stimulation of the ships sensors.\n\nFY19 - TSTC\/ATD\/BFTT Ship Set funding will procure (9) T46D's and (2) T52's and subsequent variants of hardware and software Build 5.x series in support of AN\/SQQ-89 upgrades, and ATD software builds in support of AEGIS Baseline 9 TI-16 upgrades and SSDS upgrades -- which drives the difference in unit cost. Installation funding supports installation of (19) BFTT AN\/USQ-T46D Systems.  Additional costs will be incurred to procure more materials needed to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) to meet shipboard integrated training demands.\n\nIncreased materials and quantities installed in FY19 are required to meet cyber security requirements and to maintain connectivity with Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) to meet shipboard integrated training demands."

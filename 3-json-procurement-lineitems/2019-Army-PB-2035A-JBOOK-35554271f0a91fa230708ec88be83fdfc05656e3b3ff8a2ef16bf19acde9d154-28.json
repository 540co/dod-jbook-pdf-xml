            "val": "Quality Surveillance Equipment is a family of petroleum and water laboratories used to evaluate the quality of military fuels and palatable water for our soldiers.\n\nThe Petroleum Quality Analysis System Enhanced (PQAS-E) is a fully integrated fuel laboratory installed in an environmentally controlled International Organization for Standardization (ISO) style shelter mounted on a trailer with support equipment, supplies, and a tent.  The mission of the PQAS-E consists of testing fuels received through normal supply channels, locally procured from civil sources, and captured enemy stocks. The PQAS-E is employed as the Army's single petroleum laboratory capable of performing all levels of quality surveillance tests throughout each echelon on the battlefield.  The PQAS-E is capable of modified B-2 level testing In Accordance With (IAW) Military Standard (MIL-STD) 3004 on kerosene based (e.g. Jet Propellant [JP] 5, JP-8, Jet A, Jet A-1) and diesel military mobility fuels. The shelter contains fuel test equipment (Automated Instrumentation System [AIS]), support equipment and supplies, an Environmental Control Unit (ECU), and an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). System software provides an information database\/expert system for the technician to consult in the interpretation of test results and in making recommendations for the disposition of fuels.  The automated data acquisition features allow test data from instrumentation to be sent directly to the system software, which reduces data transcription errors and eliminates the need for hard-copy laboratory notebooks. The PQAS-E system is being built at Rock Island Arsenal.  \n\nThe Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 83 PQAS-E systems."

Quality surveillance of bulk fuel is critical to aviation and ground mobility equipment. The PQAS-E gives bulk petroleum quality surveillance capability down to brigade level in a flexible, responsive, mobile lab mounted on a 5-ton trailer.  The PQAS-E is required for conducting quality tests on kerosene based and diesel fuels thus ensuring quality surveillance on the battlefield. This will help assure U.S. Armed Ground Forces' strategic responsiveness and its global force projection.  The fuels that we put in our warfighting platforms must meet purity standards or it can cause equipment to be non-mission capable.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

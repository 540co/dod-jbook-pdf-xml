            "val": "The Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radio (MNVR) enables the extension of data services within the tactical network through seamless integration of the upper and lower tiers; providing software-defined, multi-channel networking radios for a wide variety of Army tactical vehicles to meet the Army's requirement for the Mid-tier Wideband Networking (MWN) capability. The MNVR provides self-forming and self-healing communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level throughout the full range of military operations.\n\nThe MNVR, a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI), supports Army Mission Command operational requirements with a multi-channel, Type 1 (supporting multiple independent levels of security), vehicular mounted radio hosting networking waveforms. The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks.  Its route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one cohesive network.  MNVR nomenclature has been designated as AN\/VRC-118(V)1. \n\nA single award contract was awarded on 24 September 2013, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed price, 3-year ordering period.  Production of 232 radios for Test & Evaluation and certification purposes was completed in 3QFY 2014. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum. Product Director (PdD) MNVR will prepare for Government Regression Testing (GRT) and evaluation planning for First Unit Equipped (FUE)."

            "val": "FAMILY OF POWER EQUIPMENT - The Family of Mobile Electric Power Equipment consists of command and control systems for power management and distribution (intelligent power management), tactical generators ranging from 2 to 100 kilowatts, power distribution systems, energy storage systems, load banks, floodlights, cabling, and electrician tool kits. This equipment is procured and fielded to manage and provide electricity on the battlefield. Systems may be mounted on prime movers, skids or trailers. Systems support maneuver, combat support, and combat service support units requiring tactical power to operate weapons systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems, medical and messing facilities, environmental control equipment, and water purification systems. With over 10,000 generators and using diesel engines in the Operating Forces, improving their fuel efficiency and reliability will be a significant contribution to reducing the USMC fuel demand, and lightening the MAGTF. The Warfighter benefit includes a decreased logistics footprint, less reliance on petroleum derived fuels, increased local energy security, and reduced tanker losses (fewer on the road). The operational imperative to reduce fuel usage will consequently reduce refueling operations and exposing Marines to hazardous fuel convoy operations.\n\nEfforts encompass procurement and testing of the following principal end items and ancillary equipment:\n(1) Intelligent Power Management Systems (IPMS) which support a robust, scalable solution to interconnect, control, store and distribute power from various sources. As a result, the power requirements will be met in a more efficient manner thus reducing fuel consumption. The IPMS will use multiple electrical inputs from military generators, vehicles and renewable sources. Subsystems include Advanced Digital Control System (ADCS), Energy Storage Unit (ESU), and Intelligent Power Distribution System (IPD).\n(2) Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) procurement of the remaining Generator Sets needed systems to complete the Approved Acquisition Objective \n(3) Advanced AMMPS Digital Control System procurement to provide tactical general gridding capability that will provide greater flexibility and reduce fuel consumption of networked generators.\n(4) Large Advanced Power Sources (LAMPS) procurement of newer more fuel efficient large format generators (100-200kw) replacing the legacy generators and ensuring commonality with the Army large format generators.\n\nFAMILY OF ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES FOR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (APSCE) - This family consists of multiple suites of devices, grouped into sub-families, that are used to provide highly expeditionary power (worn on the Marine, hand-carried, or vehicle mounted) to operate communications equipment, computers and peripheral equipment in place of disposable batteries, and for scenarios where fuel powered generators are too large, too heavy, unsuitable for use, or provide undue logistics burden due to refueling needs.\n\nThe first suite of devices encompasses renewable and hybrid energy based systems, and includes the man-portable Ground Renewable Expeditionary Energy Network System (GREENS) that supports a company level operations center and Forward Operating Base, the man-packable Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems (SPACES) that supports Combat Outposts and Observation Points, and the Mobile Electric Hybrid Power Source (MEHPS) that provides light systems (up to  5kW) and medium (up to 10kW) to power mission command and control, information networks, communications, environmental control, life support, sustainment and illumination at the battalion level. All of these exploit the use of solar energy and power management technologies to recharge batteries and directly power electronic equipment without a need, or with a reduced need for re-fueling generators.\n\nThe second suite of devices includes both shelter based (semi-rugged) and fully ruggedized power supplies (operate outdoors) that convert grid power (alternating current) to vehicle based power (direct current). These power supplies support all elements across the USMC with standard models that provide variable electrical output to support a wide electrical range of operations. \n\nThe third suite of devices is the vehicle mounted inverters that convert vehicle 24 Volt direct current to 120 Volt alternating current to allow on-the-move operation of equipment that previously was only able to be used while stationary. These inverters are used throughout all theaters of operations by Marine Corps aviation and ground units requiring 120 VAC, 60Hz electrical power. The inverter based power systems reduce the requirement for tactical generators needed for small operations.\n\nThe fourth suite of devices provides an alternative power source for each radio in the Marine Corps (seven different models). These radio power adapters allow radios to be powered from central power sources (such as GREENS and SPACES) or grid power (120 volt AC generator), reducing the consumption of rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries when in garrison\/shelter operations. These systems lead to cost avoidance, conservation of batteries, and flexibility of operations.\n\nThe fifth suite supports all lead-acid batteries used in vehicles and artillery systems, and a host of battery chemistries (nickel-cadmium (NiCd),  nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (Li-ion))  used in command, control and communications systems. The suite consists of battery chargers, battery conditioners, battery maintainers, battery analyzers, and battery safety management systems for both garrison (semi-rugged) and deployed operations (ruggedized). As the USMC (and all services) move towards fully adopting rechargeable batteries for energy efficiency and logistics demand reduction, this suite of devices is critical to support numerous weapons, robots, IED jammers, surveillance systems, vehicles, and communication systems that are highly dependent on batteries for their operation."

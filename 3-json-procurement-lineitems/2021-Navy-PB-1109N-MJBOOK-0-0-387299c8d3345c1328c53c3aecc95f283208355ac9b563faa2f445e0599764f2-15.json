It is a force multiplier which allows the Commander to leverage the process of Planning, Collection, Consolidation, Analysis, Production, and sharing of civil information to support the visualization and understanding of the civil environment to the military Commander's decision making process.  Program name has changed from Civil Affairs Capability Set and Civil Affairs Information Data Processing System (CIMDPS).\n\nMilitary Information Support Operations (MISO) Family of Systems (FOS), which consists of the Fly-Away Broadcast System (FABS)variants are heavy, medium and light, Next-Generation Loud Speaker (NGLS), Radio-In-A-Box (RIAB), and Marine Corps SOF Integration Node (MSIN), provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Commander the ability to plan, develop, deliver and assess messages and actions to influence select foreign groups and promote themes to change those groups' attitudes and reduce civilian interference, minimize collateral damage, and increase the population's support for MAGTF operations.  The MISO was established in response to multiple Marine Requirements Oversight Council Memorandums, and the approval of a MISO Organizational and Operational (O&O) Concept, 16 June 2015. MISO capabilities are critical to the success of the MAGTF mission, enabling commanders to shape the information environment, counter enemy propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, and adversarial narratives. \n\nThe Signature Management (SIGMAN) capability will support MAGTF Operations with a baseline capability to include blue-force electromagnetic signature monitoring, assessment and projection.

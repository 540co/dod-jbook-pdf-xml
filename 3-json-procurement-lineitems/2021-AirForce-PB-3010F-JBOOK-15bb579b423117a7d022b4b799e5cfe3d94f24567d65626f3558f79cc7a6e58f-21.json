ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to alternate mission equipment and new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).\n \nWeapon System Support Center (WSSC) provides procurement, replacement, upgrade, test, integration and travel of B-2 peculiar support equipment (PSE), Special Test Equipment (STE) and their sub-components for B-2.  Software Sustainment in support of AFGSC operational support facilities, Aircraft Program Depot Maintenance, and Test Ranges. The B-2 WSSC is a one-of-a-kind facility that develops, maintains, sustains, integrates, tests, and certifies the B-2 Spirit software. The B-2 WSSC combines flight controls, radar, weapons, navigation, traffic control, communications, displays, flight management,external interfaces, and defensive management functionality in a test environment to conduct component, subsystem, and end-to-end software tests before deployment to the test aircraft and\/or the operational fleet.\n\nOther Post Production Support (PPS) provides funds to procurement, replacement, upgrade, test, integrate and travel of other PSE, STE, support systems and their sub-components used in B-2 associated Laboratories, Sustainment Depot Maintenance activities, Test Ranges and AFGSC operational support facilities.\n\nThis exhibit Line Item, covers ICS for legacy components as well as WSSC support.

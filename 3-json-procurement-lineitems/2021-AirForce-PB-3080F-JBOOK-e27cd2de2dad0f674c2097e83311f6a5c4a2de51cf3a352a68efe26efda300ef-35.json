The items being procured are commercial software licenses to allow limited\/full deployment. The software is known to work in commercial environments. MROI will test the Air Force configuration of the software in DISA environments with added Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE)objects.\nTesting will be performed as part of the System Implementer activities. The contract was awarded 11 Jul 2018. MROI DT&E is projected for Mar 2020, IOT&E is projected for Apr 2020 and FOT&E is projected for Jan 2022. \n\nMaintenance Repair and Overhaul Initiative will be using, for the first time in FY 2019, 3080 funding to support CY 2022 delivery of the MROI capability currently under development (RDT&E). Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.  \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0708055F."

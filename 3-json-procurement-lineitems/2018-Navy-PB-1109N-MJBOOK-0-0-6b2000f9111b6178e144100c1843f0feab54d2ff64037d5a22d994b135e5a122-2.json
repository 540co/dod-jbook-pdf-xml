The program will counter two converging obsolescence issues on the LAV-ATM platform: (1) the M901 Emerson turret is no longer in production and has been retired from the U.S. Army inventory, and (2) the M2203A3 TOW system is being replaced by the M41 SABER system in the USMC infantry and tank battalions leaving the LAR Battalion as the only unit using the legacy TOW system.\n\nThe LAV Modification & Sustainment program funds important vehicle modifications, support equipment and tools and other projects that increase LAV reliability and readiness while simultaneously reducing operations and support costs. The Marine Corps Program Management LAV Modification Team uses multi-disciplined integrated project teams consisting of engineering, logistical, contracting and financial personnel to manage Modification projects. Currently the LAV Modification and Sustainment program will capture the ACAT IV(M) Obsolescence program (OB).  The OB program will address the Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) automotive system obsolescence and reduced performance due to increased Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).  The OB program will improve fleet reliability and availability by addressing the three sub-systems (power pack, driveline and steering) that specifically account for 95% of total system downtime.  Also, fields a modern driver's instrument panel and LAV-25 Slip Ring. The contract for the Obsolescence project was awarded as a Sole Source contract to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  This effort will require delivery of 8 kits (7 installed on vehicles, 1 stand-alone kit) during the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to support Developmental Testing (DT), fielding, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) products, Modification Instructions (MI) and Engineering Change Proposals (ECP)."

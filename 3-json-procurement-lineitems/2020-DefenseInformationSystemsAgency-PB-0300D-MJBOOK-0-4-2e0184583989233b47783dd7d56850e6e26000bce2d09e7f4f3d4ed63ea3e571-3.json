            "val": "DISA provides a portfolio of services that includes legacy capabilities delivered by the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program supporting a resilient and flexible infrastructure that enables a collaborative environment for secure information sharing across the Department of Defense (DoD). These critical warfighter, Business, and Intelligence Mission Area services enable more than two million authorized DoD users to collaborate across the Combatant Commands (COCOMs)\/Services\/Joint Staff\/Agency\/Mission Partners using a suite of web-accessible services. The portfolio also includes the DoD Visitor service that transitioned from a Government developed service to a Commercial-Off-the-Shelf annual right-to-use licensed service operating on domain controllers throughout the DoD.  This service allows personnel to \"go anywhere within the DoD, login, and be productive\".  It includes the privilege management Authentication Gateway Services (AGS) and the DoD Enterprise Portal Service.  The AGS is integrated with the Identity and Access Management services supporting brokered Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication for DoD applications without a native PKI authentication capability.  The DoD Enterprise Portal Service provides users with a flexible web-based hosting solution to create and manage mission, community, organization, and user focused sites.  The individual suite of capabilities within the portfolio of services provides the user with the flexibility to couple the services in varying ways to support their mission needs. This flexibility provides unprecedented secure access to web and application content, critical imagery, intelligence and warfighter information from anywhere, at any time, on any DoD authorized device. The portfolio of enterprise services delivers tangible benefits to the Department by providing capabilities that are applied by the US Forces, Coalition forces, and Allied forces to support full spectrum joint and expeditionary campaign operations. These enabling benefits include the ability to:\n\n\u2022 Enhance collaborative decision-making processes\n\u2022 Improve information sharing and integrated situational awareness\n\u2022 Share and exchange knowledge and services between enterprise units and commands\n\u2022 Share and exchange information between previously unreachable and unconnected sources\n\u2022 Schedule and coordinate meetings with people across the DoD Components\n\u2022 \"Go anywhere in the DoD, login, and be productive\"\n\u2022 Create and manage mission, community, organization, and user-focused sites from global locations\n\u2022 Exchange knowledge to enable situational awareness, determine the effects desired, select a course of action, the forces to execute it, and accurately assess the effects of that action\n\nThe portfolio contains capabilities that are also key enablers to the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) mission of providing a global net-centric enterprise infrastructure in direct support of joint Warfighter, National level leaders, and other mission and coalition partners across the full spectrum of operations."

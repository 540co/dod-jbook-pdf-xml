            "val": "Special Equipment for User Testing is comprised of multiple programs for the Major Operational Testing Instrumentation and Army Threat Simulator Program.  Program provides funding for Major Operational Testing Instrumentation, Major Field Instrumentation for Operational Testing (OT), Force Development Testing and Experimentation (FDTE), and Army Warfighting Experiments (AWE).  Initiatives are tied to tactical and instrumentation systems that support each of the five joint functional concepts outlined in the Army Modernization Plan (Force Application; Protection; Focused Logistics; Battlespace Awareness; Command and Control).  The Army Threat Simulator Program procures actual foreign hardware and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) (e.g., chassis, subsystems, commercial equipment, or actual threat weapons), which are integrated into a threat simulator design for user testing and training. The program also procures a variety of test assets, such as Threat Battle Command Force, Threat Operations, Advanced Jammer Suite, and Advanced Electronic Support Sensor Suite.\n\nSpecial Equipment for User Testing programs provides support at: Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) and Operational Test Command (OTC) facilities to include Transformation Technology Directorate (TTD) at Fort Hood, TX; Fire Support Test Directorate (FSTD) at Fort Sill, OK; Airborne Special Operations Test Directorate (ABSOTD) at Fort Bragg, NC; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate (ADATD) and Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); Redstone Test Center (RTC); White Sands Test Center (WSTC); and Yuma Test Center (YTC).\n\nSpecial Equipment for User Testing was moved to MA6820 for the FY2021 funding request."

        "Description": {
            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is the acquisition approach and contract vehicle used to manage the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) enterprise network which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy (DoN). Additionally NGEN provides security for the non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  NIPRNET is a private IP network used to exchange unclassified information, including information subject to controls on distribution, among the private network's users.  SIPRNET is a system of interconnected computer networks used to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the \"completely secure environment.\"  NGEN forms the foundation for the DoN's future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense-provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services.  \n\nThe OCONUS Network (formerly Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII), now referred to as \"OCONUS\" or \"ONE-Net\") will transition to the NGEN business operating model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract (NGEN-R).  This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as a common global network through the institution of a single approved service operating model.\n\nTechnology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP):\nTRMP is a requirement performed by Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) which focuses on upgrading the existing Hardware and or Software to mitigate End of Life, End of Support and End of Software Support issues in order to maintain network performance, Architecture\/Solution Accreditations and network security.  \n\nTRMP involves the modernization and periodic replacement of NMCI hardware\/software and assigned non-IT assets identified in the NGEN TRMP plan required to support network performance.  The objective of TRMP is to improve and maintain network performance, increase network capacity based on project demand, improve security posture from vulnerabilities and integrate DoD and\/or DoN mandates.  NGEN assets are Government Owned\/Contractor Operated (GO\/CO).  A significant  amount of those assets have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported by the vendors, which makes our infrastructure vulnerable to external cyber-attacks; and diminishes enterprise solutions performance and optimization.  Our current infrastructure is aged and modernization is essential to improve storage capabilities to accommodate new emerging workforce requirements; maintain network performance, architecture\/solution accreditations, and network security.  The procurement of these assets will continue in FY18 and beyond.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H\/W and\/or S\/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.  Hence, future TRMP funding will be utilized to transition to 10GB networks.  The final phase of ORT cybersecurity enhancements were procured in FY16 for deployment in FY17.  Cyber Security enhancements previously funded with Operation Rolling Tide (ORT) funding will be procured and\/or refreshed as part of TRMP baseline beginning in FY18.\n\nOCONUS Layer 1 (L1) Fiber Optic Upgrades, Far East (FE): Install\/upgrade OSP (Outside Plant) pathway and cabling in Far East NMCI OCONUS sites (Yokosuka Japan + remote sites, Atsugi Japan, Sasebo Japan, Diego Garcia,\nOkinawa Japan) in accordance with NCTSFE BCO (Naval Computer Telecom Station Far East Base Commanding Officer) Master Plan, and Premise Cabling Layer 1 to support direct connections from each building to a distribution\nswitch in support of current and future Unified Capability (UC) and Cloud (O-365) related initiatives. Without infrastructure being updated the NMCI OCONUS network will become increasingly vulnerable as communications\nare required to transit less secure pathways and may be open for intercept or interference. If not funded, the network pathway infrastructure will not support newer technologies, faster speeds or the full range of network defense\ncapabilities.\n\nOCONUS Windows Server 2008 Operating System Eradication:  Microsoft Windows 2008 servers\/platforms (473 combined NIPR SIPR servers) will reach end of support (EoS) January 2020.  The ONE-Net enterprise, is required to upgrade all 473 servers to the target OS Windows Server 2016 or OS Windows Server 2019 to bring improved Authority to Operate (ATO) and cyber security posture.  Each server will become a CAT 1 vulnerability hit based on Cyber Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) guidelines forcing the ONE-Net program into a High Risk Escalation (HRE) Briefing situation. Windows Server 2016 or 2019 are the target OS, and will provide improved security, cloud enabling capabilities, administration accountability\/control and software patches improving cyber security.   \n\nOCONUS Transition:  Transition funding will provide for the security and technology improvements and sustainment efforts, to include systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of network infrastructure, in support of the transition of ONE-NET into the NGEN business model. This will result in a fully integrated navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach as ONE-Net goes through the process of transition to the NMCI business model from both an operating model (GoGo\/multivendor) and infrastructure perspective (aligning HW\/SW\/Capabilities to NMCI CONUS).\n\nOCONUS Technical Refresh:  OCONUS funding will provide for the technical refresh of network infrastructure that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network. Antiquated PCs will be at the end of their final warranty. It will also provide the funding for systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NGEN business model.\n\nNetwork Devices and PC Warranties (of which 15,386 have already expired and been extended) will expire (end of support) at the end of calendar year 2020, driving a one-time increase of $24.2M to refresh 20,468 computers.  Without extended support, each machine will experience a DISA CAT 1 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) hit (Cyber risk) on the Enterprise and place site accreditations packages at risk, resulting in a High Risk Escalation (HRE) scenario. \n\nOCONUS Piers Technical Refresh: In FY20 funding for OCONUS Enterprise Pier Connectivity Architecture (EPCA) is realigned from LI 8164 to LI 3050.\n\nJoint Regional Security Stack (JRSS):  JRSS is a Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations.  JRSS will replace the existing Navy cyber protection boundaries allowing for a common and operable cyber defense network across all of the DoD. The Joint Information Environment (JIE) scope which included JRSS was laid out broadly in a series of Joint Chiefs of Staff Tank and Deputy Secretary Management Action Group (DMAG) decisions in 2012.  DoD CIO, via the JIE EXCOM, has further refined the priorities of those tasks, consistent with the implementation strategy.  JRSS is DoD's near term modernization priority, and is fielded as an Enterprise Service, as designated by the DoD CIO in November 2015.  With the designation of JRSS as an Enterprise Service, the DoD CIO required JRSS be separately identified.\n\nCollateral Equipment - MILCON Project P-013:  Project P-013 provides Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams in Hawaii Wahiawa, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards.\n\nCollateral Equipment - MILCON Project P-913:  Project P-913 project combines the cyber defense missions from two buildings (M-51 and NH-95) into one 187,000 square foot integrated communications facility with SCIF capability at Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMSLANT)."

            "val": "FY20-24 funding for LI 8164 was reduced by a total of (-$9.96M) due to realignment of EPCA\/PIERS from BLI 8164 to BLI 3050. This realignment included: realigning (-$4.96M) from OCONUS Piers Technical Refresh, as well as (-$5.00M) from the Technical Refresh Modernization Plan (TRMP).\n\nCONUS TRMP (+$3.0M):\nThe FY19-FY20 net growth for the Technical Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP)supports the Cable Plant outside plant\/inside plant (OSP\/ISP).  \n\nOCONUS Network Improvement (+$16.4M):\nFunding required to support one-time replacement of end-of-life\/support operating system software on ONE-Net servers, along with Cloud enabling capabilities and services in order to provide enhanced cyber security posture, in support of ONE-Net's transition to NMCI (NGEN Contract).  OCONUS Network Improvement efforts include:\n\n    -  OCONUS Windows Server 2008 Operating System Eradication (+$5.5M):  Funding required to support one-time replacement of end-of-life\/support operating system software on ONE-Net servers, along with Cloud enabling capabilities and services in order to provide enhanced cyber security posture, in support of ONE-Net's transition to NMCI (NGEN Contract).  \n\n    -  OCOUNS Layer 1 (L1) Fiber Optic Upgrades, Far East (FE)($10.9M): Requirement includes fiber optic and copper cabling, patch panels, wall and\/or floor mounted cabinets and racks, and construction of UFC (Unified\nCapabilities Framework) compliant telecommunications room in accordance with DoD 8500.1. This upgrade is required to execute critical time sensitive National Command Authority direct mission. \n \nOCONUS Transition (+$0.14M):\nOCONUS Network (ONE-Net) will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract (NGEN-R). This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as a common global network through the institution of a single approved service operating model in conjunction with the current Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) network. In essence, the CONUS and OCONUS networks are intended to merge into a single allocated baseline as part of the NGEN-R contract.\n\n    -  The FY20 OCONUS Transition funding increase will provide for the security and technology improvements and sustainment efforts of the network as ONE-Net goes through the process of transition to the NGEN business model from both an operating model (GoGo\/multi-vendor) and infrastructure perspective (aligning HW\/SW\/Capabilities to NMCI CONUS).  \n    \n\nOCONUS  Technical Refresh (+$19.5M) includes:\n    - OCONUS funding will provide for the technical refresh of network infrastructure that have reached end of life\/support and now present security risks to the network. Antiquated PCs will be at the end of their final warranty. It will also provide the funding for systems\/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NGEN business model.\n\n    -  The FY19-FY20 Technical Refresh will fund the refresh and installation of 20,468 end points (PCs\/laptops).  PC Warranties (of which 15,386 have already expired and been extended) will expire (end of support) at the end of calendar year 2020, driving a necessary refresh 20,468 computers.  Failure to replace these machines will result in a DISA CAT 1 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) hit (Cyber risk) on the Enterprise and place site accreditations packages at risk, resulting in a High Risk Escalation (HRE) scenario.\n\n\nNCTAMS LANT C4I (-$2.4M):\n    -  The decrease is due to the MILCON Project P-913 for completion of project - Shore Based Enterprise Network Enhancements: This funding supports the procurement and installation of NMCI infrastructure to the new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMSLANT) Facility (MILCON P-913).  \n\n\nCollateral Equipment - MILCON Project P-013 (+$0.362M):  \n    -  Increase from FY19 to FY20 will support equipment purchases associated with the development and refurbishment of Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) to ensure information sharing is executed in a controlled environment and at the appropriate classification levels for the Cyber Mission Forces Teams.  MILCON Project P-013 provides SCIF space for three PACOM Cyber Protection Teams, in Hawaii Wahiawa, which currently has inadequate SCIF space to meet USCYBERCOM standards."

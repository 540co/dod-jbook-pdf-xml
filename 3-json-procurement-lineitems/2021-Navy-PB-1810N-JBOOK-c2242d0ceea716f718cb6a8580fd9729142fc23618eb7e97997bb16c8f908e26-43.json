JCSE's Modernization Program is structured around Combatant Command (CCMD) requirements using emerging technologies. Services formally influence JCSE's acquisition plan through semi-annual program reviews and make recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid.\n\nThis line funds the Department of the Navy's one third (1\/3) portion of the total JCSE Program.  This program is jointly funded by Army, Navy and Air Force in support of Joint Tactical Force and Joint Special Operations Task Force Headquarters."

This includes the maximum capabilities for narrowband, wideband and protected satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals and systems, tactical radios, terrestrial communications systems, satellite hubs, networking elements, virtual appliances, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities, alternative power solutions, airborne \/in-route, forced entry, cyber security, and mobile joint Command and Control (C2) equipment. JCSE's Modernization Program's objective  is to meet emerging real-world operational and cyber defense requirements with maximum capabilities, utilizing the smallest possible footprint, while performing a seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command, Control and Communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and headquarter elements deployed to austere locations around the globe.  JCSE's program is built\/restructured based on Combatant Command(CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. The Services influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.  Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM) 0291-14, the Navy is mandated to fund one third (1\/3) fair share of JCSE's validated Modernization Program."

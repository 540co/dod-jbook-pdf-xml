            "val": "GBU-39\/B: Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) is a weapon system that provides fighter and bomber aircraft with a tactically significant standoff attack or direct attack\/close air support capability from outside point defenses, against fixed\/stationary targets. The SDB I weapon system consists of a 250-pound class weapon, a 4-place common carriage system, logistics support and mission planning module. The FY2018 modifications are to the bomb rack unit (BRU-61\/A) carriages. This modification adds capability to operate on 270 volts direct current (VDC) aircraft power in addition to the current configuration of 115 volts alternating current (VAC) capability. This will reduce risk to F-35A integration of SDB I and provide future aircraft loadout options to the inventory carriages. It will also increase weapon loadout by 200% and provide risk reduction for future SDB II integration. The original procurement of BRU-61\/As was 2,000. This effort will procure 245 dual power modification kits. The BRU-61\/A carriage requirement document is the Combat Air Forces Operational Requirements Document 304-97-C-A for Miniature Munitions and Carriage System dated April 2005.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve production DMS\/MS\/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier\/parts replacement and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0207327F."

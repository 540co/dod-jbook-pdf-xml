Since USCENTCOM's AOR, covering the Middle East, includes the challenges of regional stability and violent extremists, this Combatant Command's mission is critical in regards to the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). To meet its mission responsibilities across this geographical expanse, HQ USCENTCOM must rely heavily on Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) systems capable of achieving full spectrum information superiority. \n\nFunding for this effort is contained in PE 0201122F USCENTCOM Communications.\n\nUSCENTCOM COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS: Effort will provide end of life replacement for, but not limited to, Command and Control (C2) systems (thin client, server, etc), Joint Information Environment (JIE), classified and unclassified voice, data and video dissemination, storage area network (SAN) infrastructure, establishment of mission partner networks such as but not limited to; CENTCOM Partner Network (CPN), CENTCOM Partner Network Extended (CPN-X), Mission Partner Environment Information System (MPE-IS),and other coalition partner networks which provide secure networks for bilateral \/ multilateral information sharing up to the SECRET RELEASABLE level. Support maximum data storage capacity requirements for HQ war records collection, Modeling & Simulation Systems (J8MS), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) required for the command's collateral classified and unclassified data networks. This equipment provides HQ USCENTCOM with effective C4 systems to effectively conduct current and future operations throughout the AOR.\n\nPE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS\n\nAir Forces United States Central Command (AFCENT) is the ACC component designated to support USCENTCOM operations in deployed theaters for the AF. Funds C4 systems throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). Procurement efforts include: communications infrastructure requirements, satellite terminal equipment, data network servers and associated information assurance tools, information transfer nodes and routers, joint radio relays, as well as deployed air traffic control and landing systems and navigational aid systems. AFCENT funds\/support our portion of CENTCOM directed mission partner initiatives such as CPN X to ensure interoperability.\n\nFunding for this effort is contained in PE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

The C4\/Information Technology (IT) supporting the command must be replaced to meet the ever increasing demands of current, ongoing contingency operations, and the growth of data storage requirements. \n\nSTORAGE CAPABILITIES: HQ CENTCOM and CENTCOM Forward HQ require maximum storage capabilities to maintain a level of readiness, reduce server footprint, and continue capabilities as they are implemented. \n\n\nPE 0201131F AIR COMBAT COMMAND (ACC) COMMUNICATIONS FY20 funds will provide:\n\nBASE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE (C4I) INFRASTRUCTURE. This FY20 effort will support communications CENTCOM Theater Posture Plan (TPP)locations identified for post OEF support. This effort is required at several AFCENT locations in the AOR and will provide critical infrastructure to support the transition to the Joint Information Environment, as required by DoD CIO mandate. Mode 5 mandate requires AFCENT obtain transition devices for theater radars to ensure proper C2. Developing infrastructure must be funded to support counter Unmanned Aircraft System technologies and new technologies for air domain awareness. Replacement for aged Air Traffic Control And Landing Systems equipment is required.\n\nSouthwest Asia - THEATER ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS - AFCENT must procure new system to support contingency operations and base opening\/closure requirements, which average 2 base openings and closing per year regardless of new or ongoing contingencies. A new Jordanian Base (MSAB) has been added to the enduring base list and commercialization projects are underway to completed transition from tactical support to enduring infrastructure.\n\nJOINT INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT: Implementation of JIE at MacDill AFB with HQ USCENTCOM establishing regional node. \n\nFY20 effort will continue to support infrastructure and services essential secure networks for bilateral and multilateral information up to the secret releasable level. Support the networks and cross domain solution necessary to securely and safely integrate coalition sensors and C2 capabilities with C2 efforts.

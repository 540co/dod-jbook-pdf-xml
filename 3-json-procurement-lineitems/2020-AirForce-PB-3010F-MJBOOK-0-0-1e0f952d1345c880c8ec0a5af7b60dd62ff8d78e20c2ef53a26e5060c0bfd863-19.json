The ICS program is an on-condition and limited overhaul repair capability repairing Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) associated with airframe structures, hydro-mechanical components, and avionics components until permanent depot repair capability is established. ICS also provides travel support and interim repair to alternate mission equipment and new or modified components stemming from B-2 aircraft modification programs until a permanent source of repair has been achieved either organically or through Contractor Depot Maintenance (CDM).\n \nWeapon System Support Center (WSSC) provides procurement, replacement, upgrade, test, integration and travel of B-2 peculiar support equipment (PSE), Special Test Equipment (STE) and their sub-components for B-2.  Software Sustainment in support of AFGSC operational support facilities, Aircraft Program Depot Maintenance, and Test Ranges. The B-2 WSSC is a one-of-a-kind facility that develops, maintains, sustains, integrates, tests, and certifies the B-2 Spirit software. The B-2 WSSC combines flight controls, radar, weapons, navigation, traffic control, communications, displays, flight management,external interfaces, and defensive management functionality in a test environment to conduct component, subsystem, and end-to-end software tests before deployment to the test aircraft and\/or the operational fleet.\n\nOther Post Production Support (PPS) provides funds to procurement, replacement, upgrade, test, integrate and travel of other PSE, STE, support systems and their sub-components used in B-2 associated Laboratories, Sustainment Depot Maintenance activities, Test Ranges and AFGSC operational support facilities.\n\nThis exhibit, Line Item 74, covers ICS for legacy components as well as WSSC support. ICS for new B-2 modifications is covered in Line Item 73.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M.

The basic components of the RF RAMS complete set are (1) MK26 Transmitter with two antennas, (6) MK16 Receivers with antennas and (1) M6 Battery Retainer which provides additional power for the transmitter.  RF RAMS has a nominal range of 2 kilometers line-of-sight (LOS) and 5 kilometers LOS with the M6 Battery Retainer.  The Shock Tube Initiator (STI) M50 is an associated component\/interface that is required when using the MK152 to initiate Modernized Demolition Initiators M19, M21 and M23.  This item is Code A, approved for service use."

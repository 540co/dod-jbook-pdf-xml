GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operational Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A is being re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services \/ Tactical Server Infrastructure."

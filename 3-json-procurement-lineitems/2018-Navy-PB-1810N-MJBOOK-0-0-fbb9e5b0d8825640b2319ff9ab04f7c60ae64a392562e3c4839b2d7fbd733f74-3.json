            "val": "The Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) consists of an electric motor which can be coupled to the propulsion reduction gear to provide propulsion power from the ship service gas turbine generators (SSGTGs) during low speed operations. This will permit the securing of one or more propulsion gas turbines and allow higher power loading resulting in more efficient operation of the SSGTGs, which will be generating electric power for the HED as well as ship service power.  In addition to reducing fuel consumption and the associated costs, HED results in the additional benefits of increasing the ship's range, increased time on station performing its mission, and reducing the frequency of fuel replenishment.\n\nThe HED shipsets will include the propulsion motors, motor drives and the associated controls, interfaces, and mounting equipment that will be required to install the HED on DDG 51 Class Ships.  This budget supports the HED for installation on DDG 51 Class in-service ships beginning in FY17.\n\n[P3A \/ TD001 - Hybrid Electric Drive]: Procure Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) for the DDG 51 Flight IIA Ships including equipment procurement, recurring equipment engineering, equipment integration, and ILS\n\n[P3A \/ Equipment Modification]: Equipment Modifications will be performed to correct deficiencies and engineering change proposals."

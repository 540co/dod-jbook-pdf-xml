            "val": "In FY2021, P-1 Line Item BP11 FBLOST APPN 3010, BP 11, CLC Family of Beyond Line-Sight Terminals efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022F, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021F due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.  \n\nThe Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and provides Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC). FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include: Strategic platforms and airborne\/ground command posts via Milstar; AEHF; and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. \nThe Force Element Terminal (FET) subprogram provides a nuclear survivable terminal capable of communicating with the Milstar and AEHF satellites, and provides for survivable NC3 data transport services (EAM dissemination and force report back) for airborne platforms. The FET is for the B-52 and select RC-135 aircraft and will not provide satellite control or PNVC functionality. \n\nThe PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) system.  PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users.  Equipment upgrades required for this system include the development and production of several new components by other organizations, including the Baseband Interface Group (BIG) and Multi-Stream Summing Device (MSD-III) for airborne users.\n\nPrograms and projects in the space warfighting enterprise are evaluating ways to maximize innovation, resiliency, and our ability to rapidly respond to known and emerging threats.  Space enterprise efforts aim to execute technology risk reduction efforts, integration of new or repurposed capabilities, enterprise decision-making tools, experimentation, and rapid prototyping and fielding via all appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanisms.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203001F"

In FY 2021, the program will continue to support platform install activities, provide Interim Contractor Support for the existing fielded terminals and other support activities. Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain. Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, prototyping, depot activation (stand-up), ICS, etc."

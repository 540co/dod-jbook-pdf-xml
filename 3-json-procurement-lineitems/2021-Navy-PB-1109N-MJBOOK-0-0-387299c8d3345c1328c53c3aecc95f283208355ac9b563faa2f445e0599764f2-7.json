            "val": "Ground Based Air Defense supports the Low Altitude Air Defense (LAAD) Battalion's mission of Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to include; Bases, Posts and Stations, the necessary Force Protection to defeat the full spectrum of threats associated with the Marine Corps Low-Altitude Air Defense mission, to include hostile aerial threats from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). With the proliferation of both military and commercial UAS platforms, the program is pursuing and acquiring more lethal and survivable GBAD Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS) platforms; such as JLTV's with armored protection and better maneuverability than a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), providing increased Counter-UAS capabilities now and continually spiraling out increasing capability for the foreseeable future.\n\nMarine Air Defense Integrated System Family of Systems (MADIS FoS):  The MADIS FoS provides the Marine Corps with an organic, upgradable, and state of the art capability to protect MAGTF maneuver forces, installations and other designated defended assets from Fixed\/Rotary Wing (FW\/RW) aircraft and Unmanned Aircraft Systems.  The MAGTF is at increased risk of lethal air attack and fires coordination from next generation aircraft as well as significant advances from small UAS (sUAS) threats due to their rapid development and proliferation by the commercial sector.  To address these threats, the MADIS FoS consists of mission tailored variants designed for sustained operations ashore, afloat, and aboard installations.\n\nThe MADIS FoS includes Advanced Man Portable Air Defense (A-MANPADS) platform which provides close-in, low altitude, surface-to-air fires and command and control in defense of the MAGTF.  The MADIS Increment 1 (Inc 1) will be accomplished with the procurement and installation of Government Furnished C-UAS equipment on a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) beginning in FY20.   MADIS Increment 2 will focus on extended range for the Inc 1 system as well as kinetic and non-kinetic capability supporting increased lethality.  The Installations MADIS (I-MADIS) detects, tracks, and enables identification of sUAS operating above and in close proximity to an installation.  The I-MADIS will begin procurement in FY20. \n \nMedium Range Intercept Capability (Inc 3):  The MRIC will provide the MAGTF Commander the ability to defend fixed\/semi-fixed and other designated defended assets against cruise missiles, mortars, and precision guided missiles from a ground based air defense platform.  MRIC is designed as a system-of systems and will be integrated with Marine Corps organic Command and Control (C2) and Joint Integrated Air Missile Defense (IAMD) architecture.  The program will enhance the MAGTF's ground based air defense capability to rapidly prosecute aerial threats and expand layered defense to the MAGTF and supported Naval Forces.   The MRIC will begin procurement in FY22 and will be comprised of missiles launchers, intercept missiles, and a Command and Control (C2) system."

            "val": "FY 2019:  $18.334M\n\n-Funds provided for the initial procurement of 203 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode V Belt Packs, required cables, adapters, pouches, and technical manual updates, as well as associated support. IFF is the military designation of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system that is used to identify and track military aircraft; and identify and defeat hostile UAS and aircraft.  Due to the negotiation of a lower unit price under a new contract, the program was able to procure additional IFF Mode V Belt Packs.\n\n\nFY 2020:  $147.606M\n\nGround Based Air Defense-MADIS FoS\n$13.165M - Funds the second and final procurement of a total of 156 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode V belt packs and cables.  IFF is the military designation of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) System that is used to identify and track military aircraft; and identify and defeat hostile UAS and aircraft.  \n$0.646M Funds the procurement of QTY 4 Virtual Stinger Trainers (VST).  VST is designed to enhance the training of Stinger Gunners by immersing them in a virtual environment to conduct Stinger engagements. The USMC will support the LAAD mission using the VST to introduce Marines at the Air Defense School House (ADSH) to the fundamentals of Stinger engagements and reinforce those fundamentals through repetition.  \n$127.932M - Funds provide for low rate initial production (LRIP) of Marine Air Defense Integrated System Increment (MADIS Inc 1) JLTV systems, an increase from 0 to 26 vehicles.  (26) LRIP systems are required to support concurrent engineering tests as well as Operational Assessment.\n$3.103M - Funds provide for the initial procurement of the Installations-MADIS (I-MADIS), to support critical infrastructure at bases, posts or stations, an increase from 0 to 1.\n$2.065M - Funds provide for the initial procurement of 26 Night Sights to replace equipment reaching obsolescence.  The Night Sight will enable Marines to perform target acquisition during day or night, during reduced visibility conditions and when engaging low observable targets.\n$0.695M - Funds the required support to the I-MADIS system.  This includes required fielding support, integrated logistics, and site surveys.\n\n\nFY 2021 Baseline Appropriation Request:  $18.920M\n\nFunding in this line item has been reprioritized while ensuring the Marine Corps continues to evolve toward a force that is aligned with the National Defense Strategy.\n\nGround Based Air Defense-MADIS FoS\n$14.230M - Will fund MADIS Inc 1 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) technical and production labor support which includes engineering, integration, cyber security, safety, information assurance, and software support.  This support is required to fully integrate (26) vehicle kits onto the JLTV and ensure the system meets operational requirements.\n$3.538M - Will fund the procurement of one I-MADIS.  I-MADIS supports critical infrastructure at bases, posts or stations.\n$1.152M - Will fund required support to the I-MADIS system.  This includes required fielding support, integrated logistics, and site survey support.\n\nThe decrease of $128.686M from FY20 to FY21 is due to a change in major components of the MADIS Inc 1 requiring additional integration, engineering, developmental and operational testing prior to MS C in 4QFY21.   The program continues to leverage existing efforts through the Army to minimize development costs and maintain schedule."

GFE Components include Fire Control Optics, EOIR Optics, turrets, drone on drone defeat capability, Modi, Mobile Vehicle Power Amplifier (MVPA), SkyView, C2 components, and a radar. Decrease from FY20 request to FY21 request is due to a change in major components of the MADIS Inc 1 requiring additional integration, engineering, developmental and operational testing prior to MS C in 4QFY21.  The program continues to leverage existing efforts through the Army to minimize development costs and maintain schedule.",

        "Description": {
            "val": "A dynamic, asymmetric threat and operational environment demands full spectrum, strategically responsive, agile and dominant land forces.  Immediate response by a lethal, versatile, tactically agile joint force capable of operational maneuver is essential to fulfilling the Army's Warfighting needs.  The Stryker-equipped Brigade Combat Team (BCT) is this force.  The use of a common platform\/common chassis design reduces requirements for repair parts and logistics support in the area of operations.  In response to operational needs identified in the Theater of operations, the Double V Hull (DVH) survivability enhancement was approved for development and production by Acquisition Decision Memorandums (ADM) signed April 2010 and May 2011, respectively.  The May 2011 ADM approved production of two Brigades, a 3rd DVH Brigade was approved in September 2011 with a 4th approved in September 2014.  A DVH brigade is constructed through an exchange effort by which components and mission equipment packages are removed from flat bottom Strykers to be reassembled in the DVH structure along with the associated DVH-unique components.  In May 2012, Phase 1 (Technology Development), Stryker Engineer Change Proposal 1 (ECP1) development effort was approved to provide  power generation, suspension, and network upgrades to restore Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations.  In May 2013, Phase II (Engineering and Manufacturing Development) development was approved.  The ECP1 had a successful production decision in Aug 2016.   ECP1 vehicle changes will be incorporated into the build of DVH-equipped Stryker vehicles using the exchange process.  The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), equipped with ECP1 DVH vehicles, can be used across the full spectrum of military operations.  The SBCT deploys rapidly and conducts effective combat operations immediately on arrival to prevent, contain, stabilize, or resolve a conflict through shaping and decisive operations.  Configurations of Stryker ECP1 DVH vehicles are:\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Infantry Carrier:  The DVH w\/ECP1 Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICVV) carries an infantry squad with individual equipment.  The ICVV also provides protected transport and supporting fires for the infantry squad during dismounted assault. DVH w\/ECP1 Infantry Carrier Vehicles with a Scout Dismount Kit provide for dismounted force situational awareness, gathering and transmitting real time intelligence while moving throughout the battlefield in close, complex, and urban terrain.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Mortar Carrier:  The DVH w\/ECP1 Mortar Carrier (MCVV) supports infantry units with screening obscurants, suppressive forces and on-call supporting fires.  120mm, 81mm, and 60mm mortars provide complementary capabilities with responsive, accurate and lethal indirect fire support to the dismounted infantry assault.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Commander's Vehicle:  The DVH w\/ECP 1 Commander's Vehicle (CVV) provides the brigade commanders and infantry battalion commanders with the means to receive information and data, analyze, prepare and transmit data, and control the forces\/functions carrying out combat missions.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Fire Support Vehicle:  The DVH w\/ECP 1 Fire Support Vehicle (FSVV) provides automated enhanced surveillance, target acquisition, target identification, target tracking, target designation, position location, and communications functionality.  Targets will be transmitted instantly to the fire support system and shooter.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Engineer Squad Vehicle:  The DVH w\/ECP 1 Engineer Squad Vehicle (ESVV) provides maneuver\/mobility support capabilities which include obstacle clearing, in-stride breaching of surface mines, proofing of subsurface mines, and smoke generation for local protection.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Medical Evacuation Vehicle:  The DVH w\/ECP 1 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEVV) is the Battalion Aid Station for brigade units, providing treatment for serious injury and advanced trauma cases.\n\nDVH w\/ECP1 Antitank Guided Missile Vehicle:  The DVH w\/ECP 1 Antitank Guided Missile Vehicle (ATGV) is the brigade's primary tank killing system.  The ATGV reinforces the brigade's infantry battalion, reinforces the brigade reconnaissance squadron, and provides long-range direct fire."

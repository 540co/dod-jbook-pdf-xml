The PLS A1 truck contains capability for onboard Load Handling System, 16.5 ton PLS trailer, PLS Enhanced Container Handling Unit (E-CHU) for transporting 20' International Organization for Standardization containers, M3 Container Roll-in\/Out Platforms (CROPs), M1077 Flatracks and M1 Flatracks in an armored configuration. The PLS ESP will remanufacture and upgrade older PLS A0s to the A1 configuration. The PLS A1 has improved survivability with an integrated underbody A-cab and a scalable B-kit (common to the HEMTT A4), an improved powertrain, suspension and electrical system and adds an anti-lock braking system, air conditioning and traction control. The PLS fleet is an essential force sustainment enabler in transportation and ordnance formations. This program produces a like-new vehicle with a full new vehicle warranty. \n\nThe Approved Acquisition Objective for PLS ESP is incorporated with PLS NEW at 7,102 vehicles."

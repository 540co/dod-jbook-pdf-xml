The GFT program satisfies the Active, National Guard, and Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo- specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. This gaming capability allows units and commanders to train individual and collective tasks at the company and below level with minimal amount of resourcing required (land, ammunition, transportation, etc.) in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) 2028. Through the use of GFT systems, commanders are able to refine and rehearse unit Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prior to executing live, large-scale training events. GFT trains higher echelon units and staffs by facilitating Tactical Exercises Without Troops (TEWT)."

Additionally, funding will also provide government management and system technical support of fielded GFT Systems to ensure compliance with the US Army cybersecurity requirements. Lastly, funding will continue to provide Government Furnished Material to ensure continued distribution of gaming content and to facilitate technical support to the Army training community. \n\nGovernment Management will provide engineering and technical oversight, and travel for the GFT program. System Technical Support provides the oversight, implementation, and help desk support in order to facilitate the program's Cybersecurity Strategy for its fielded GFT classroom and Stryker Virtual Collective Trainer (SVCT) suites across 88 various Army locations. Government Furnished Material provides a Web Portal for the centralized distribution, repository of content and tech support of the VBS3 and gaming software for the Army training community. GFT is a critical program enabling other virtual and constructive training capabilities and the Integrated Training Environment (ITE)."

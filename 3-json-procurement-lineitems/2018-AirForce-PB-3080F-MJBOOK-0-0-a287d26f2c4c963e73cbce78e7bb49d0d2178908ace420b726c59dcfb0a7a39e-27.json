To execute America's Global Reach mission, Air Mobility Command's 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) plans, schedules, and directs a fleet of more than 1,100 mobility aircraft.  The 618th AOC operates combat delivery, strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. Funding for this exhibit contained in program element (PE) 0401840F. \n\na. MOBILITY AIR FORCE (MAF) COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) INFRASTRUCTURE:  Provides base wired\/wireless infrastructure equipment supporting AMC's 618th AOC and AMC's 12 bases to assure connectivity to AMC's command and control (C2) systems and to ensure they remain operational at AMC bases and operating locations.  MAF C2 Infrastructure ensures connectivity with critical Air Force systems such as the Information Transport System (ITS), Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and the Global Decision Support System (GDSS); AMC's C2 systems such as the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) and Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system and the infrastructure for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems across AMC providing intra-base command and control for base security, emergency management, flightline operations\/maintenance, and crash response.  \n\nb. DEPLOYED SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (DSATCOM):  Provides C2 communications capabilities for deployed Mobility C2 forces and mission support team C2 operations.  These operations rapidly install mission support communications at austere base locations where communications to support air mobility operations are nonexistent or insufficient.  The DSATCOM program is the primary funding vehicle for procuring communications equipment supporting these components.  The resources directly support C2 and In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of deployed and enroute personnel, aircraft, and cargo providing critical communications to Contingency Response Groups (CRGs).  CRGs are self-sufficient groups of multi-skilled, highly-trained airmen, representing different Air Force specialty codes, who can rapidly deploy anywhere in the world with little notice to open air bases for any follow-on mission.  The Hard-side Expandable Lightweight Air Mobile Shelter (HELAMS) is the primary weapon system providing this support.  It is a rapidly deployable, self-contained C2\/ITV command center.  This shelter functions as the base command post during the initial phases of airbase build-up and contains integrated communications equipment such as radios, computers, printers and fax machines. No funding is required for DSATCOM after FY16.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces PE 0404011F - P-40A\nPE 0404011F Special Operations Forces:\n\nCommand and Control (C2) Air Rapid Response Kits (ARRKs) are tailored packages providing temporary base operating support (BOS)(i.e., SOF living facilities, command and control (C2), armory, fuel storage, water purification, and cold weather protection), which allow Air Force Special Operations Forces (AFSOFs) to perform expeditionary deployments to austere environments before conventional\/service-common BOS packages become available.  FY16 funding totals include $2M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations.\n\nFY16 funding totals include $2M appropriated for Overseas Contingency Operations."

            "val": "SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES\/EQUIPMENT\nThis program includes special purpose vehicles and trailers of commercial design which support the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), shore activities, and Naval Special Warfare. Included are tank trucks used to transport fuel to construction equipment at remote locations, waste disposal trucks used to transport waste oil\/water, overhead maintenance trucks with insulated buckets and pole and line trucks used for repair\/replacement of power systems, wreckers used in vehicle recovery\/towing, field servicing vehicles used for on-site preventive maintenance of construction equipment in the field, and ammunition handling trucks used in loading\/unloading and transporting munitions. Truck tractors and trailers required by the active operating forces in the logistics support of the fleet are also included in this program. Representative types and uses include van and stake bed semi-trailers to support loading\/unloading of ships and aircraft and movement of materials and equipment for fleet operations, lowbed semitrailers for transport of construction equipment, tank trailers for transport and dispensing of water, fuel, and hazardous liquids, and semi-trailers transport of materials.\n\nThis program includes funds for the procurement of Bearcats, used on paved or improved roads, to guard and protect the TRIDENT II (D5) missile while the missile is in storage, being handled, or in a movement convoy to and from the waterfront at the Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) in Kings Bay, GA and the Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (SWFPAC) in Bangor, WA. Equipment is used in support of Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) mission of securing the Limited Area and provides for security vehicles to replace existing (aging) vehicles used in roving patrols of the Limited Area and to support TRIDENT II (D5) missile movement convoys.\n\nCOMBAT CONSTRUCTION SUPPORT EQUIPMENT\nThe equipment included in this program is used by the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Naval Beach Group (NBG), and Naval Special Warfare to provide responsive military construction support to the Navy, Marine Corps, and other forces during military operations, construction of base facilities, and in the conduct of limited defensive operations. These facilities and equipment are vital for maintaining the integrity and sustainability of these units during contingency and wartime operations. Equipment items include containers, required for prepacking and securing on-site storage of expensive equipment to expedite mobilization, fuel storage tanks required for on-site storage of fuel, water purification units required for camp water treatment systems, water storage tanks (collapsible fabric) required for water treatment, storage and distribution systems, power distribution panelboards required for camp electrical distribution systems, and tension fabric structures required for expeditionary facilities to provide equipment maintenance and company shops, berthing, laundry, and combat operations centers. \n\nOCEAN CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT\nOcean Construction Equipment are those specialized equipment and facilities components used primarily by the Naval Construction Force (NCF) to perform site selection, construction, inspection, maintenance, repair and removal of fleet and other Navy fixed underwater and ocean facilities, and in support of shore-based hyperbarics. Some equipment is centrally procured under this line as initial outfitting for the Underwater Construction Teams' (UCT) Tables of Allowance (TOA). Most of the equipment is for the Ocean Construction Equipment Inventory (OCEI). It is centrally procured and maintained by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command in a controlled inventory to ensure the NCF response to fleet needs is both timely and adequate. Utilization of funds from this program sustains the Naval Construction Force (NCF) capability to meet fleet requirements for ocean facility site survey, construction, inspection, repair, and removal, resulting in the ability of the fleet to retain its readiness through utilization of its underwater facilities. The funds requested in FY 2018 will be used to replace existing equipment kits and systems which are well beyond their useful and maintainable lives. In many instances, these replacements will result in slightly improved or modified capabilities.\n\nMOBILE UTILITIES SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (MUSE)\nEquipment in this program consists of electric power generation plants, electric substations, and electric switch gear.  MUSE provides short-term support for fleet and shore utility requirements resulting from equipment failures, changes in planning and programming, temporary replacement of utilities equipment which is out of service, ship support and testing, expeditionary military operations, and utilities outages resulting from natural disaster. Operations supported are submarine testing, ships' repair, retrofit and nuclear refueling, cold iron applications, serious utility system deficiencies, MILCON delay, and advanced base requirements."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "The funds requested in FY 2018 will provide for requirements to support fielding a fleet of equipment within useful life expectancy, this includes replacement of equipment which has exceeded its useful life or new approved equipment requirements necessary to support the various expeditionary missions. Focus for expeditionary facilities is the procurement and fielding of Command and Control tent camp equipment and berthing.  These engineered capabilities integrate joint standardization board (JSB) approved equipment to ensure interoperability, energy enhancements and commonality across the Navy and DOD. These materiel assets support Naval Special Warfare (NSW) core mission requirements and are essential to the readiness and battlefield effectiveness of NSW in winning the current fight against ISIS and other extremist elements. In order to take the fight to the enemy and deny them the use of remote safe havens, NSW must be prepared to construct and operate from austere, expeditionary camps in the most remote corners of the globe.\n\nFY18 funds for Ocean Construction Equipment will provide for the planned incorporation of the new technology of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) into the capability of the UCTs.  These AUVs will allow the Underwater Construction Teams (UCTs) to perform their underwater survey and data gathering missions in dangerous forward areas in a much safer way.  UCT personnel can program the AUV to go to a certain underwater location, collect the data that has been requested by the mission commander, and return with the data.  This reduces the exposure of the UCT personnel to hostile actions.\n\nMUSE funds requested in FY 2018 will be utilized to procure one One-Megawatt (1-MW) mobile electric power generation plant.  \n\nCapabilities presented on the P40-A consist of many components. Variation in components being procured in a given fiscal year will yield fluctuation in the unit costs.\n\nFY 2017 decrease in Items under $5 million OPN by $0.520M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.\n\nThe FY 2017 funding request was also reduced by $0.161M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances."

            "val": "This budget line item provides the resources to implement the Navy Fleet Training Range (FTR) Instrumentation Program Plan.  These FTRs provide the primary means of fleet combat readiness training.  The plan addresses the following major procurement areas: Electronic Warfare (EW) simulators, Systems Replacement and Modernization (SRAM), and generic systems such as range computer systems, simulation, surveillance systems, Aerial Targets Range Support equipment includes Moving Land Targets (MLT) and Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) equipment; MLT includes vehicles, vehicle components, and Engineering Change Proposals to upgrade hardware; TTSP equipment includes EW & Threat Payload simulations, electronic countermeasures equipment and active emitter augmentation equipment,  Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS), Large Area Tracking Range (LATR), Undersea Warfare Training Range\/ Pacific Fleet Portable Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) Range, and range infrastructure necessary to enable Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) training capability.  The integral parts of these major range programs include but are not limited to the following: voice communications, weapons scoring systems, display consoles, radars, tracking subsystems, control\/ computation subsystems, display\/ debriefing subsystems, processors, HF\/ VHF\/ UHF receivers, transmitters\/ transceivers, multiplexers, intercom circuits, encoding devices, frequency interface control systems, peculiar support equipment, and other specialized equipment.\n\n[P5 \/ SC004 SRAM - Systems Replacement and Modernization]: The SRAM program provides for the procurement of numerous non-recurring range equipment replacement and modernization efforts that are needed at all Navy training ranges.  SRAM procurements replace and modernize economically unmaintainable systems and equipment in order to increase range efficiency. Funding for installation of minor equipment is required in all years for all ranges.  Sample procurements include antenna replacement, datalink replacement, electrical generators, and range safety lighting equipment.\n\n[P5 \/ SC012 OS - Ocean Systems]: Funds the procurement and upgrade of fixed underwater training ranges at Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Barking Sands, HI and Southern California ASW Range (SOAR), CA, as well as portable underwater range systems supporting Forward Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) in the Pacific.  Upgrades include cyber security enhancements, increased range accuracy, and splash detection capabilities.  The underwater ranges are used to provide individual and unit level training for basic antisubmarine warfare (ASW) skills. Large exercises such as Composite Training Unit Exercises (COMTUEX), Fleet Exercises (FLEETEX), and Joint Task Force Exercises (JTFX) are conducted in the vicinity of the fixed underwater training ranges.  Items procured under this cost element include hydrophones, undersea cable, and shore system electronics. Funded programs include Portable Undersea Training Range (PUTR), Barking Sands Tactical Underwater Range (BARSTUR) refurbishment, and West Coast Undersea Warfare Training Range (WC USWTR).\n\n[P5 \/ SC161 OS - East Coast USWTR]: The purpose of the East Coast USWTR is to establish a shallow-water training range capability on the East Coast.  The primary USWTR mission will be to support Fleet readiness through training and tactical development of submarine, surface ship, and aircraft undersea warfare (USW), surface warfare (SUW), and mine warfare (MIW).  Secondary missions will include training in shallow water, regional conflict operations involving the naval special warfare (NSW), electronic warfare (EW), and amphibious warfare (AMW) mission\/ operational capability areas.  Additionally, joint mission areas that may be supported include joint littoral warfare and joint surveillance and warning.  Previously subsumed within Ocean Systems, East Coast USWTR has been broken out separately in accordance with the FY 2007 Defense Appropriations Act.  Items procured under this cost element include hydrophones, undersea cable, and shore system electronics for East Coast USWTR.  End result is a single in-water training range.\n\n[P5 \/ SC034 LATR Shipboard Rotary Technology Upgrade]: The Large Area Tracking Range (LATR) Shipboard and Rotary Wing Technology Upgrade (LSRTU) will replace obsolete components in the legacy shipboard and rotary wing tracking instrumentation and will deliver enhanced Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) tracking capability for Large Force Exercise support.\n\n[P5 \/ SC132 LATR Navigation Technology Refresh]: Produce and field a Navigation Technology Refresh for Large Area Tracking Range (LATR) Airborne Instrumentation Package-Fixed Wing (AIP-FW) pods to continue training instrumentation support for Large Force Exercises such as COMTUEX and JTFEX.  The current AIP-FW pods exhibit tracking anomalies cause by internal navigation system degradation.  These pods have been deployed since 1996 and many flight hours have accumulated resulting in stress on the aging internal components.  LATR tracks and integrates participating surface and air platforms into an overall training range display for mission feedback.  LATR Navigation Technology Refresh will keep LATR operational through the projected sunset date of FY 2030.\n\n[P5 \/ SC158 TCTS Ground Subsytem]: The Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) will procure fixed range instrumentation equipment for both shore-based (aircrew training) and deployable (ship\/sub\/aircrew training) applications.  TCTS instrumentation will transmit exercise scenarios; simulate\/stimulate all exercise participants sensors\/weapons with the exercise scenario; track all exercise participants and events, e.g., weapons engagements; and provide accurate, realistic, and timely feedback.  TCTS is building on technology developed for existing tactical training range systems.  TCTS consists of airborne instrumentation called Participant Subsystems and Ground Subsystems.  Increment 1 systems have been procured and fielded. Procurements for Increment II systems with encrypted communication capability will begin in FY21.\n\n[P5 \/ SC140 TCTS - Remote Range Unit]: The Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) will procure fixed, transportable, and mobile range instrumentation equipment for both shore-based (aircrew training) and deployable (ship\/sub\/aircrew training) applications.  TCTS instrumentation will transmit exercise scenarios; simulate\/stimulate all exercise participants sensors\/weapons with the exercise scenario; track all exercise participants and events, e.g., weapons engagements; and provide accurate, realistic, and timely feedback.  TCTS is building on technology developed for existing tactical training range systems.  TCTS consists of airborne instrumentation called Participant Subsystems and Ground Subsystems.  Increment 1 systems have been procured and fielded.  Procurements for Increment 2 systems with encrypted communication capability will begin in FY21.\n\n[P5 \/ SC105 EW - Threat Presentation]: Threat Presentation includes all the necessary components and elements associated with presenting friendly training event participants with an opposing force (OPFOR) operating environment that replicates the expected enemy order of battle.  The capability of a range to recreate any Electronic Combat electronic order of battle requires a range to simulate or emulate basic elements of Electronic Combat such as search, acquisition and tracking radars, anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) systems, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, infrared (IR) systems, jammers, coastal threats, airborne simulators, and information warfare\/ command and control systems.  Individual pieces procured vary from year to year.\n\n[P5 \/ SC151 MLT Hardware]: The Moving Land Target (MLT) Program will provide Moving Land Target vehicles to train aircrews in the demands of Close Air Support (CAS), Time Sensitive Targeting (TST), Target Identification, and Forward Air Controller (FAC) procedures within a Network Centric Warfighting force. MLT provides aircrews with threat representative targets that provide infrared reactivity, mobility, and realistic radar cross-section targets to meet their combat training and testing needs. The MLT program procures Moving Land Target vehicles, vehicle components, and Engineering Change Proposals to upgrade hardware.\n\n[P5 \/ SC106 TTSP]: The Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) replicates various threats dependent upon the objectives of the test and evaluation event(s). TTSP procures the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial\/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters). TTSP accomplishes this through a collection of modules which are integrated into the target in various configurations, providing the ability to simulate the RF environment.\n\n[P5 \/ SC711 LVC Range Integration]: Funds Range Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) integration allowing real-time telemetry to be received from new aircraft reaching the fleet.  Establish persistent integrated training between AEGIS, CVW, Maritime & UAS training assets by enabling LVC capability with live aircraft on Tactical Training Range (TTR) sites.  Effort will modify range infrastructure at multiple range sites to provide secure network connectivity to provide robust integrated training capability.  Allows range communications, networking, and mission brief, display, and debrief capabilities at multiple levels of security.\n\n[P5 \/ SC158 - TCTS Block Upgrade]: The Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) will procure fixed range instrumentation equipment for both shore-based (aircrew training) and deployable (ship\/sub\/aircrew training) applications.  TCTS instrumentation will transmit exercise scenarios; simulate\/stimulate all exercise participants sensors\/weapons with the exercise scenario; track all exercise participants and events, e.g., weapons engagements; and provide accurate, realistic, and timely feedback.  TCTS is building on technology developed for existing tactical training range systems.  TCTS consists of airborne instrumentation called Participant Subsystems and Ground Subsystems.  Increment 1 systems have been procured and fielded.  Annual block upgrade software packages will be released to fielded Increment 1 systems to correct system deficiencies.  These block upgrades were previously budgeted under SC920, TCTS Non-Recurring.  Software block upgrades will deliver the capability to integrate and merge F-35 range participant information with TCTS time-space position information (TSPI) at TCTS ground systems for training exercise display and debrief at multiple Tactical Training Range (TTR) sites."

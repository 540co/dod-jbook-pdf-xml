The LM2500 is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The LM2500+ Marine Gas Turbine and its associated Engineering Control Systems provide main propulsion power for the Navy's amphibious assault ships including the LHD-8 USS MAKIN ISLAND, LHA-6 USS AMERICA and LHA-7 USS TRIPOLI. The LM2500+ is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The control system for both engines provides for both local and remote engine operations.\n\nThe Rolls Royce (Allison) 501-K Series Gas Turbines are used to drive electrical generators in Ship Service Gas Turbine Generators (SSGTG). The 501-K17 is used on the CG-47 Class ships. The 501-K34 is an upgraded version used on the DDG-51 Class ships and is not interchangeable with the 501-K17. The MT5S is a higher-power derivative of the 501-K engine family (utilizing Rolls Royce's new \"Marine Trent\" or \"MT\" naming convention vice the older \"501-K\" naming convention) used for auxiliary electrical generation on DDG-1000 class ships; the MT5S is not interchangeable with the 501-K17 or 501-K34. The Rolls Royce MT-30 is used on LCS-1 (Lockheed) Class for main propulsion and DDG 1000 for electrical generation. Rolls Royce 250-KS4 is used as a starter gas turbine for the 501-K34 on DDG 79 and follow.  The Rolls Royce MT7 gas turbine is used for both lift and propulsion fan power on the next generation of LCAC landing craft.\n\nThe budget funds the following:\n\n[P40A \/ PE009 GE Readiness Improvement Upgrade Kits]: PE009 - MODIFICATION KIT PROGRAM: This cost code procures modification kits listed below for the GE Gas Turbine Engine.

Procurement quantities are not shown because these funds are used to procure a variety of modification kits, with specific kit quantities and prices varying from one year to the next. The kits included in the cost code are as follows:\n--Accelerometers (Vibration Monitor)\n-- Compressor Rear Frame Mid-flange Fastener installation \n-- C-Sump Lubrication Supply Line\n-- Power Turbine Upgraded Speed Sensor\n-- Improved Drain Shutoff Valve\n-- Turbine Mid-Frame Modification\n-- 7B Piping Modification\n-- 5-Element to 6-Element Pump Conversion\n-- T5.4 Flexible Thermo Harness\n-- Mid Flange Fastener\n\n[P40A \/ PE010 Stock Rotating Spares]: PE010 - GAS GENERATOR: This cost element procures the LM2500 single shank propulsion gas turbine for the DDG-51 & LCS-2 class ships and the LM2500+ single shank propulsion gas turbine for the LHD8 and LHA6-LHA8. The programs projected FY-18 in-service population of single shank propulsion gas turbine engines is estimated to be 382 due to new construction. Breakdown of ship class spare procurement is listed below. The procurement of these engines includes all required shipping\/storage containers.  \n\nDDG LM2500 Single Shank \nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 36 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 28 with a requirement for eight (8) additional gas generator units to be procured IAW projected class population in FY21.\n\nLCS 2 LM2500 Single Shank. \nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 3 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 2 with the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator unit to be procured IAW projected class population in FY21.\n\nLHD8\/LHA6-LHA8 LM2500+ Single Shank.\nBased on experience with 35 years of usage demand data on the LM2500 Engine and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 2 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current onhand is 1, which leaves the requirement for one (1) additional gas generator to be procured IAW projected class population. The program has budgeted to procure one (1) Gas Generator Assembly in FY18 to meet the baseline requirement. This engine represents a significantly different configuration than the standard LM2500 Single Shank Engine procured in previous fiscal years.\n\nLM2500 Hot Section Kits \nAre procured as required from the below list per quarterly failure analysis and maintained to replace High Pressure Turbine (HPT) components beyond economical repair (BER). Shortages of replacement blades increase engine repair turn-around time (RTAT) during engine refurbishment\/repair as a result of material shortages.\n\nProcurement quantities are a result of procuring various kits of various costs. The kits included in the cost code are as follows:\n--HPT Shrouds\n--HPT Seal Assembly\n--HPT Blades\n--HPT Nozzles\n--Compressor Blades\n\n[P40A \/ PE014 Special Support Equipage]: PE014 Special Support Equipage Procurement of Special Support Equipment allows for increased depot repair capability, thereby stabilizing or reducing the cost to overhaul engines at the depot. This tooling is generally associated with depot modifications being made to the engine to increase engine reliability. This increased capability reduces engine overhaul costs.\n\n[P40A \/ PE015 LM2500 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL]: PE015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG\/DDG modernization schedules. Procurement and installations are budgeted to correspond with CNO ship availabilities. One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.   The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. This modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system. \nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\n[P40A - 2 \/ PE001 STOCK ROTATING SPARES]: PE001 - STOCK ROTATING SPARES\nThis cost code procures the MT-30 & MT-5 gas turbines for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and Zumwalt DDG 1000 program, the 250-KS4 SSGTG starter engines for the DDG 79 and follow, and the 501-K34 gas turbines DDG 51 class ships. The procurement of these engines includes all required shipping\/storage containers.\n\nMT-30 Gas Turbines\nBased on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 6 spares are required to support the fleet.  Current MT-30 spares on-hand is two (2), four (4) budgeted procurement in FY18-FY21.  The projected FY-22 and beyond in-service population of MT-30 gas turbine engines is fifty (50) due to new construction.\n\nMT-5 Gas Turbines\nBased on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 2 spares are required to support the fleet.  Current MT-5 spares on-hand is zero (0) with two (2) budgeted in FY18-FY19.  The projected FY-21 and beyond in-service population of MT-5 gas turbine engines is six (6) due to new construction. Earlier budget exhibits called for procurement of (1) MT-5 in FY19 and (1) in FY20.  The current budget calls for procurement of (1) MT-5 in FY18 and (1) in FY19.  This change was required because Rolls-Royce has indicated that production of the MT-5 will end before an FY20 procurement can occur.  The total requirement for (2) spare MT-5 gas turbines is unchanged\n\n250-KS4 SSGTG Starter Engines\nBased on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 12 spares are required to support the fleet requirements.  Current spares on-hand is twelve (12) which achieves the baseline sparing requirement.  The projected FY-18 in-service population of starter engines is 112 due to new construction. Operation Tomodachi has resulted in the radiological contamination of twelve (12) 250-KS4 Marine Gas Turbines, which created an unplanned requirement to replace the twelve (12) affected engines beginning in FY13.  Currently, the program has budgeted for six (6) replacements through FY22 with four (4) already procured, leaving a requirement of two (2) additional replacement assets to be procured.\n\n501-K34 Gas Turbines\nBased on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 26 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current 501-K34 spares on-hand is 22, which leaves a requirement of 4 additional gas generator units to be procured.  The projected FY22 in-service population of gas turbine engines is 222 due to new construction.\n\n[P40A - 2 \/ PE007 MODIFICATION PROGRAM]: PE007 - MODIFICATION PROGRAM\nThis cost code procures modification kits listed below for the Rolls Royce Marine Gas Turbines (MGT).  Analysis of Rolls Royce MGT engineering performance data, metrics, the SEA 21 Top Tech Issues and the component improvement program has identified necessary improvements to correct Rolls Royce MGT deficiencies.  The modifications addresses the Fleet's top maintenance and reliability issues by reducing failure rates of system components, and improve Rolls Royce MGT readiness.\nThe modification kits are packaged and shipped to the ship for installation during schedule CNO availability by a team of NSWCPD (Philadelphia) and Alteration Installation Team (AIT) personnel. Procurement quantities are not shown because these funds are used to procure a variety of modification kits, with specific kit quantities and prices varying from one year to the next. The kits included in the cost code are as follows:\n\n--Engine Vibration Monitor\n--Cyber Secure CPU upgrade\n--SSGTG Bleed Air Control Valve Installation and Improvement\n--SSS Clutch upgrade to Air Turbine Starter (ATS)\n--SSGTG FADC 2-1 HMI Computer Conversion\n--SSGTG RIMSS Exhaust Backflow Detection System\n--Output Quill Shaft Bolt Replacement\n--RIMSS Tachometer Connector Improvement\n--Model 139 SSV and Off Mounted fuel Mod\n--FADC upgrade conversion\n--MT30 variant conversion kits\n\n[P40A - 3 \/ PE830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING]: PE830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING The review and approval of any production contract technical documentation, or the separate development of this documentation to include: \n - Technical Manuals \n - Signal Flow Diagrams \n - PMS \n - Level III Production Drawings \n - Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD) \n - Program Support Data \n - Allowance Parts Lists (APL's) \n - Engineering in support of final design reviews \nThis includes efforts associated with tracking and updating NDE, MGTIS and Weblog to reflect completed installations and ensure consistent documentation for engine configuration management.\n\n[P40AMOD \/ PE015 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL SHIPSET]: PE015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)This cost element procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG\/DDG modernization schedules. \n\nFY21 quantity changed from five (5)to three (3) due to DDG modernization program schedule change. The procurement schedule for DFC ship sets is dictated by the Department's master schedule for DDG modernizations. The number of DDG modernizations changes from one year to the next based upon ship and dry dock availability.  \n\nOne DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four DDG class LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset. \n  \nThe DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. In summary this modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system.\n\nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.\n\nPE6IN - INSTALLATION FOR DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC) \nFY17 planned installations reflects the FY16 procured units in LM2500 Gas Turbine (BLI 0110) exhibit. \n\nThis cost element funds the installation of Cost element PE015-Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets as part of the CG\/DDG HM&E modernization program. This includes pre-assembly at NSWCPD (Philadelphia), shipping to installation location, shipboard installation, training, post installation operational testing and associated travel cost."

Each hull has a total of three (3) SSGTG units installed.  Each SSGTG is controlled by a Full Authority Digital Control (FADC).  CG-47 class uses the 501-K17 and DDG-51 class uses the 501-K34.  There are currently three variants of the 501-K34 SSGTG: AG9130, AG9140HF and AG9140RF. The AG9140RF also includes the Remote Independent Mechanical Starting System (RIMSS) consisting of the 250-KS4 engine.  The quantity of modification kits procured corresponds to the number of SSGTG units to be upgraded.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next. The number and type of kits installed in any given Fiscal Year (FY) varies depending upon ship availability schedules during that FY.   FY2017 budget of $4,571K funds; Ship Change Document (SCD) ; FADC HMI Upgrade, Qty 21, $1,415 - System upgrage; SCD 5216, Qty 24, $173 - FADC 2-1 Conversion; SCD 10677, Qty 9, $234 - Off-Eng Fuel Valve (CG47); SCD 12115, Qty 18, $213 - RIMSS Tachometer; AYB 9130-021R1\/9140-018R1, Qty 99, $34 - HUM BRK.  The remaining balance is for ancillary materials related to each of the aforementioned SCDs.   The increase in the PE007 budget FY17 represents a change in the types and quantities of modification kits purchased from one year to the next; these changes are driven by ship availability schedule and include both procurement and installation costs.",

In summary this modification is\nestimated to be 75% more reliable than old system.\nThis upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft;\nwith a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall\ndetection and shutdown capability."

            "val": "The Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) is a modernization effort to replace the legacy aviation command and control equipment within the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS).  CAC2S provides the Aviation Combat Element with the necessary hardware, software, equipment and facilities to effectively command, control, coordinate and integrate aviation operations within the Marine Air-Ground Task Force and Joint and Coalition Forces.  CAC2S integrates air surveillance information from MACCS organic radars (AN\/TPS-59 and AN\/TPS-80 G\/ATOR) and is interoperable with Composite Tracking Network (CTN) to enable coordinated air battle management and fires with the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC). CAC2S interfaces ground command and control systems to enable greater integration of air-ground operations across the MAGTF. CAC2S Increment I replaces legacy aviation command and control systems in the following Marine aviation agencies: Direct Air Support Center (DASC), Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), and Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC). Future CAC2S increments incorporating Marine Air Traffic Control, Ground Based Air Defense, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), airborne and shipboard variants and capabilities are anticipated."

        "Justification": {
            "val": "FY 2018 Base Appropriation ($48.295M):\n\nFunded continuation of the CAC2S full-rate-production (FRP) contract procuring Lots 2 and 3 of the AN\/TSQ-297 Full Deployment Units (FDUs). Twenty-one (21) FRP\/FDU systems were procured to buy out the remaining quantity of systems needed to attain the CAC2S Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) of 50 systems. \n\nCAC2S Lot 3 FDU procurement was executed 1 year ahead of schedule. Funds to accelerate production were sourced through a Should Cost initiative that reduced government furnished equipment (GFE) and reallocated the funding to accelerate CAC2S Lot 3 production from FY 2019 to FY 2018. Following award of the FRP contract, Headquarters Marine Corps, Combat Development & Integration (CD&I) approved removal of legacy Tactical Data Link (TDL-A\/B) requirements from the CAC2S Capability Production Document. It was determined that CAC2S implementation of modern, prevalent TDL's (TDL-J, JREAP & CEC) provides the capabilities required to operate in joint \/ coalition environments and that the legacy TDL-A\/B offered limited utility. Removal of TDL-A\/B requirements and associated GFE components enabled reallocation of funds to support procurement of Lot 3 in FY 2018 - a year ahead of schedule.\n\nIn addition, the FY 2018 budget supported all activities required for CAC2S procurement and fielding which included procurement of remaining GFE, production \/ fielding support and new equipment training. GFE primarily consists of components that contain controlled, cryptographic items such as the Army-Navy\/Portable Radio Communication 117G (AN\/PRC-117G) and Miniature Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR) Engine - Selective (GPS MPE-S).\n\nFY 2019 Base Appropriation ($32.587M):\n\nFunds procure tactical voice\/data radios associated with the CAC2S MRQ-13 Communications Subsystem (CS) refresh\/upgrade. The CS was originally fielded in FY 2006 and has been sustained and repurposed to provide CAC2S operators access to tactical radios required to communicate with aircraft and external agencies. The CS is a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) mounted shelter containing voice over internet protocol (VoIP) networking\/intercom components and tactical radios that enables remote communications access and control from laptop computers within the CAC2S operations facility\/tent. The seventy-seven (77) CS vehicles associated with CAC2S currently retain 2006 era radios. These obsolete radios must be replaced to meet NSA crypto modernization mandates and enable CAC2S to maintain voice\/data interoperability with joint forces. FY 2019 funds made available through the FY 2018 Should Cost initiative allows accelerated procurement of tactical radios for the CS refresh\/upgrade to occur beginning 1 year ahead of schedule. Accelerated procurement of the tactical radios increases CS interoperability, reliability and sustainability and enable CAC2S to meet NSA crypto modernization mandates as the legacy\/obsolete CS radios and networking components are replaced with modern, readily supportable communications equipment. \n\nThe FY 2019 budget also supports the procurement of the Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS) Block II upgrade required to comply with DoD frequency remapping and NSA crypto modernization mandates by FY 2020.\n\n\nFY 2020 Base Appropriation ($37.203M):\n\nFunds will continue the procurement of radios and voice networking\/intercom components associated with the AN\/MRQ-13 Communications System (CS) refresh\/upgrade. Replaces obsolete voice\/data communications components with modernized equipment that is more reliable, readily supportable and cyber-secure, enabling integration with CAC2S voice\/data networks and interoperability with joint forces.\n\nFunding continues to support CAC2S FDU fielding and associated, on-site new equipment training that is provided with CAC2S deliveries to the operating forces.  Supports installation of engineering changes that require integration upon initial delivery of the production systems.\n\nThe $4.616M increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports continued procurement of voice communications components required to refresh\/upgrade the seventy-seven (77) CS vehicles."

The AN\/TSQ-297(V)1 variant is equipped with a tent-based operations facility providing 18 operator workstations.  The CAC2S (V)1 variant is fielded to Tactical Air Operations Centers (TAOC), Early Warning & Control (E\/WC) detachments and Direct Air Support Centers (DASC) agencies.  Following FRP contract award, Headquarters Marine Corps, Combat Development & Integration (CD&I) approved removal of legacy Tactical Data Link (TDL-A\/B) requirements from the CAC2S Capability Production Document. Removal of TDL-A\/B requirements and associated GFE components from the FRP contract \/ systems enabled reallocation of funds to support procurement all CAC2S V1 variants with FY2017 and FY2018 appropriated funds.",

The CS upgrade replaces 2006 era, obsolete voice\/data communications components with modernized equipment that is more reliable, readily supportable and cyber-secure, enabling integration with CAC2S networks and interoperability with joint forces. FY 2019 funds made available through a FY 2018 Should Cost initiative allows accelerated procurement of components for the CS refresh\/upgrade to occur beginning 1 year ahead of schedule. Accelerated procurement of the refresh\/upgrade components improves CS interoperability, reliability and sustainability and enable CAC2S to meet NSA crypto modernization mandates as the legacy\/obsolete CS radios and networking components are replaced with modern, readily supportable communications equipment. The $12.781M increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020 supports continued procurement of voice communications components required to refresh\/upgrade the seventy-seven (77) CS vehicles.",

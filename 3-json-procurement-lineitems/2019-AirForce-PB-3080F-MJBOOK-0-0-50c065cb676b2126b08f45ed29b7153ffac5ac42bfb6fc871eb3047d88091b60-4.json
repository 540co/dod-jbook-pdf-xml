            "val": "The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) Family of Vehicles (FoV) have been chosen as the multi-service (USMC, Army, Navy, and Air Force) tactical vehicle replacement for the HMMWV. JLTV provides major operational improvements in Force Protection (FP), payload, mobility, fuel efficiency and reliability, along with the growth potential to meet future mission requirements. The JLTV also has a companion trailer that is available with the vehicle to replace the HMMWV trailer (M1101\/M1102).   \n\nThe USAF investment in JLTVs began in FY17 and FY18 under 823230 - Security and Tactical Vehicles.  Starting in FY19 and throughout the FYDP, JLTVs will be procured under BPAC 823210.  The USAF JLTV program will have multiple Work Directives generated and worked through the Joint Program Office (JPO) for USAF specific requirements and kit operability on three JLTV variants and a JLTV trailer.   \n\nGeneral Purpose (GP) JLTV - The GP JLTV is the base vehicle that carries a 4 man-crew with a payload of 3,500 lbs. Users: ACC, AFMC, AMC, PACAF, USAFE\n\nUtility (UT) JLTV - The Utility JLTV carries a 2 man crew for cargo delivery or shelter carrier.  It supports a payload of 5,100 lbs.  Users: ACC, AFMC, AMC, PACAF\n\nHeavy Guns Carrier (HGC) JLTV - The HGC JLTV carries a 4 man-crew and a Gunner in Turret or Remote Weapon System (RWS). It supports crew served weapons (M-2 or MK-19) with Gunner's Protection Kit or RWS.  Users: AETC, AFCENT, AFGSC, AFSPC, AMC, PACAF, USAFE\n\nJLTV Trailer - The JLTV Trailer is capable of meeting similar mobility characteristics to the prime mover and is capable of safely carrying payload of 5500 lbs.  Users: EOD\n\nExpansion Kits - Expansion kits are made up of both the Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) kit and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) kits.  The total unit cost of each JLTV will vary based on the expansion kit requirements selected by each user community (EOD, SFS, TACP, Red Horse, Medical, AFSOC) based on mission requirements. If mission requirements change, certain kits may be added to the vehicle at a later time, post-production, to meet ops tempo.\n\n- Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) Kits comes fully installed and integrated into the vehicle during production. CFE kits include, but are not limited to, Armor kits, intercom kit, run flats, combat bumpers, and explosively formed projectile protection kits.\n\n- Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Kits when ordered as an expansion kit are integrated into the vehicle during production. Integration includes: \"all necessary cabling (power, signal, RF), connector(s), and hardware required above and beyond the Contractor furnished Base Vehicle Platforms Infrastructure and Baseline Integration Kits. GFE kits include, but are not limited to, VRC radio kits, CREW-CVRJ kits, DVE kits, shot detection, CROWS and OGPK kits. No LRUs are included in the expansion kits.\n\nWork Directives: Funding will be needed to complete compatibility and operability testing work directives with the OEM on any new AF specific requirements that will be added to the JLTV based on user requirements.  Work Directives will also be required for any repairs that will need to be executed prior to JPO long term repair and maintenance contracts are awarded."

The model calculates vehicle requirements by fund year by BPAC using end of life projections based on depreciation and service life of the vehicle, cumulative sustainment cost and mission priority.  \n  \nQuantities reflected on the PDOCs show current requirements for each year supporting Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG), Rapid Airfield Damage Repair (RADR), European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), Set the Theater Initiatives for PACOM, and other initiatives as they arise.\n\nUnit Cost is subject to change from year-to-year based on buy quantities and user expansion kit requirements provided by each user community based on mission requirements.   Unit cost is also subject to change based on fluctuations in contract pricing."

COMSEC provides support for Protected Secure Voice and Data transmissions, the Electronic Key Management Systems (EKMS) transition to the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), the National Security Agency (NSA) directed Cryptographic Modernization of the COMSEC infrastructure, Installations (base, posts, and station), and platforms.  CMO ensures the protection of Marine Corps and joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack. Cyberspace systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, Information Technology (IT) systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein.  Rapid changes in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cyber security an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. CMO provides the Warfighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.\n\nJoint Communications Support Element (JCSE):  Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., rapidly delivers secure, reliable and scalable command, control, communications, and computer capabilities (C4) ranging from small mobile team missions to full-sized joint task force headquarters (JTF HQ) deployments.  \n\nCombat Data Network (CDN) (formerly Tactical Data Network (TDN) Data Distribution System - Modular (DDS-M)):  The CDN provides the commander a modular, integrated, and interoperable Internet Protocol (IP)- based LAN and WAN data networking capability that forms the data communications backbone and data communications support to organizations within a MAGTF.  The CDN provides extension of the Defense Information System Network (DISN), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) as well as a Coalition networking capability and access to strategic, supporting establishments, joint and other service component tactical data networks for Marine Corps Tactical Data Systems (TDSs) and other DDS-Ms.  The CDN provides Marine Corps maneuver elements with a modular and scalable IP data transport capability that will replace, supplement and be used with existing legacy data systems through the integration of computers, routers, data switches and cabling, Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS) radio net interface units, modems, link encryption devices, and patch panels.  Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS) provide for emergency power and continuity of operations.  The CDN can operate from the SBU up to the Top Secret\/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS\/SCI) level and contains integral In-line Network Encryption (INE) device supporting IP Security (IPSec) and Virtual Private Networking (VPN).\n\nTactical Voice Switching System (TVSS):  The TVSS is a modular ISDN circuit switch capable system that combines voice and Voice Over Internet Protocol  telecommunications, multiplexing, transmission encryption, and group modem capabilities in one system for command, control, administrative, and  logistic voice communications.  Facilitates secure and non-secure voice, circuit switching functions, and network routing and management functions with current fielded tactical systems of the military services. Interoperates with joint, coalition, and host nation networks, and operates in unclassified and classified environments."

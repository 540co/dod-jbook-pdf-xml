This program procures GCCS components which include items such as servers, work stations, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and associated peripherals to provide users with the full suite of joint baseline capability (including the common operating picture) and AF specific applications such as the Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) and Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) that feed into the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES). GCCS-AF is integrated at the following locations to establish initial and full joint connectivity and operational capability across the spectrum of intelligence, operations, manpower, and logistics: AF-supported war-fighting commands, AF critical sites, Headquarters United States Air Force, Major Command headquarters (MAJCOM), numbered air forces, wings, Air National Guard (ANG) bases, Air Force Reserve (AFR) bases, and remote sites. Each site will comply with current Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) network initiatives by employing a standardized interface among AF base-level classified C2 networks, AF base-level network control centers, and the joint Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). This program provides a flexible open system and distributed C2 architecture necessary to support the joint GCCS. GCCS supports AF operations by installing and upgrading a site's classified C2 system through extensive use of COTS technology that adheres to AF command and control, communications, and computer architectures and standards. \n\nNOTE: FY2018 reflects a GCCS-AF funding decrease of $10.223M as this funding was transferred to PE 0207452F (DCAPES) as they assume responsibility for the Strategic Server Enclave (SSE) and Windows baselines for this program.\n\nFunding for the exhibit contained in PE 0303150F: GLOBAL COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM"

GCCS-AF will procure and install GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J) version 6.0 hardware and software (government-off- the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf) at warfighter Combatant Command (CCMD) and MAJCOM locations, providing a full spectrum of command, control, logistics, and intelligence capability from strategic to unit level operations with total joint service connectivity. The GCCS architecture supports functional users on each base and specifically incorporates manpower and logistics functions into GCCS. These fielding activities are consistent with the AF's Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) C2 structure and integration with DoD's emerging next generation joint C2 enabler."

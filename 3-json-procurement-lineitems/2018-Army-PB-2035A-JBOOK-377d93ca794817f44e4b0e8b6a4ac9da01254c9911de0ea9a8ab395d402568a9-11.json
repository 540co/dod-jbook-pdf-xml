This Mod of In-Svc funding procures and fields Tactical Computer Digital Mission Planner (T-CDMP) AN\/PYQ-19. T-CDMP replaces the Communications Planning System (CPS)(AN\/PSQ-17). The T-CDMP is an integrated tool on which Military Strategic and Tactical Relay (MILSTAR) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite communication network planning will be performed. The T-CDMP supports real-time mission planning and network management to efficiently use limited satellite resources.  The T-CDMP generates Terminal Image Data essential for the operation of Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) and Single Channel Anti-Jam Manportable Program (SCAMP) terminals. \n\nThe T-CDMP Approved Acquisition Objective is 318."

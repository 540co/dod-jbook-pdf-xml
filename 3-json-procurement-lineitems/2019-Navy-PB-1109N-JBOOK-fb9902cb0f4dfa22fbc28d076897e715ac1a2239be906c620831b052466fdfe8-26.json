        "Description": {
            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is a Department of the Navy (DON) enterprise program (ACAT IAC) which provides secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel. NGEN forms the foundation for the DON's future Naval Networking Environment (NNE), is interoperable with and leverages other DOD provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services and supports the Joint Information Environment (JIE). For the Marine Corps, NGEN is a Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model augmented by NGEN contractors with the garrison Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) representing NGEN Marine Corps management domain. NGEN (USMC) supports the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) using a regionalized model, executed through Marine Forces Cyberspace Command, Marine Corps Cyberspace Operations Group (formerly Marine Corps Network Operations and Support Center (MCNOSC) and MAGTF IT Support Centers (MITSCs).  The NGEN (USMC) program provides personnel to the field through contractor support for the operation and support of the MCEN Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (MCEN-N) and the use of multiple contracts that provide support to the MCEN-N through equipment technical refresh and hardware\/software license and warranty generating lifecycle support services enabling Cyber\/Information Technology (CYBER\/IT) capabilities in accordance with the NGEN Acquisition Strategy. This includes enterprise infrastructure, end-user workstations, service desk, and network operations centers at Marine Corps base\/post\/stations and regional installation commands CONUS and OCONUS (Hawaii, Japan, Germany, and Korea).  The NGEN period of performance began April 2014 and coordination activities are underway for the follow on contract which will begin in FY 2018. \n\nNGEN will deliver an end-to-end hosting solution to consolidate and replace End-Of-Life (EOL) Hardware\/Software (HW\/SW) and infrastructure that currently provides enterprise network services (email, file storage, security services, identity management, etc.) to the Marine Corps Enterprise Network NIPRNet (MCEN-N) users (CONUS and OCONUS) and to provide High Availability\/Disaster Recovery (HA\/DR) capabilities that are not currently available in support of USMC Continuity of Operations requirements. The requirement also includes the delivery of a Wide Area Network (WAN) transport solution based upon the JIE and Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) construct to consolidate and replace EOL HW\/SW, and infrastructure that currently provides enterprise network WAN transport services to the MCEN-N network users.  As the consolidated upgraded solution is developed the program will continue to tech refresh end user devices, servers, routers, switches, network storage, software, initial equipment warranties, and defensive cyberspace capabilities (intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, etc.).  The hardware and software for this refresh differs in quantities and costs based on varying requirements including the current pricing, the quantities that are ordered based on hardware\/software end of service\/life and the operational balance between security and risk management. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities in conjunction with insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement.\n\nThe below descriptions are of each of the cost elements found in the P-5 exhibit, details on the annual increases or decreases can be found in the footnotes for each cost element.\n\n[P5 \/ End User Devices Tech Refresh]: The End User Device consists of a laptop for the end user.\n\n[P5 \/ Network Equipment Tech Refresh]: Network Equipment Tech Refresh consists of all network and server hardware and software to support the 142,511 end user devices on Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN). This includes the design, configuration, functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities. In addition, this cost element includes the insertion of newer technology to improve reliability and maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. The specific quantities and unit prices are determined at the time of procurement during the year of execution and these figures are based on availability of specific end-item warranties and compliance with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) approved products list.\n\n[P5 \/ Enterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM)]: The EIM project, is a multi-year configuration and integration effort resulting in the technical modernization and consolidation of the enterprise services and transport boundaries for the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) for both the NIPR and SIPR environments by conducting incremental implementation of refreshed components and design. EIM will assist in the domain consolidation effort which will assist in reducing the IT footprint for the Marine Corps.\n\n[P5 \/ Wireless Local Area Network]: Wireless LAN provides wireless access to MCEN services across hangers and maintenance bays in order to increase readiness across the Marine Corps.  Wireless will increase operational readiness of operating forces and decrease maintenance time by allowing the maintainers to connect to technical manuals and maintenance systems while they are working. Currently maintainers must leave their work and go to a kiosk where there is a wired connection. This task starts in FY 2018 and will be completed in three fiscal years.\n\n[P5 \/ Network Access Control, Compliance and Remediation (NACCR)]: NACCR is an Abbreviated Acquisition Program (AAP) modification to the NGEN and SONIC Programs of Record (PORs) supporting network access control concept on the MCEN. The NACCR end state solution will provide an integrated capability allowing only authorized and compliant assets connection to the garrison enterprise network.  This solution will detect assets in the environment, use 802.1x and Active Directory authentication protocols, as well as a series of compliance checks to ensure that critical software patches, anti-virus\/anti-malware definitions and other established compliance criteria are current, generate trouble tickets as required and report compliance standards. Any asset found to be non-compliant of the established criteria will be forced into a partially isolated network segment, where required remediation corrective actions will be taken. Should the automated remediation efforts prove unsuccessful after the prescribed number of attempts; the asset will be forced into a completely isolated network segment until it can be manually brought to the required level of compliance."

            "val": "FY18 Baseline Appropriation Request: $98.511M funding will procure services, hardware and software supporting end user devices, network infrastructure technical refresh and procurement of Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) equipment. Tech refresh supports the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, the Marine Corps' implementation of the Joint Information Environment (JIE), which includes NIPR Installation Processing Nodes (IPN) critical design and site configuration. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities in conjunction with insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. \n\nFY 2019 Baseline Appropriation Request: $87.120M will ensure the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the Marine Corps Enterprise Network against cyber attacks and vulnerabilities. Funding will procure services, hardware and software supporting end user devices and network infrastructure technical refresh. Tech refresh supports the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, the Marine Corps' implementation of the Joint Information Environment (JIE), which includes Enterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) critical design and site configuration. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities in conjunction with insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. In addition, FY 2019 efforts include the continuation of wireless implementation which will increase operational readiness of operating forces and decrease maintenance time by allowing the maintainers to connect to technical manuals and maintenance systems while they are working. Currently maintainers must leave their work and go to a kiosk where there is a wired connection. \n\nFunding decreased $11.391M from FY 2018 to FY 2019. The Wireless effort decreased by $2.000M because fewer sites will be outfitted with the wireless capability in FY 2019. In addition there was a net decrease of $9.391M which was absorbed within the Network Equipment Tech Refresh cost element to reflect the Marine Corps decision to align resources to other requirements.\n\nDetails for the increase and decreases for each cost element are described in the cost element footnotes."

The increase in end user devices (EUD) was caused by the consolidation of all USMC EUDs under the NGEN program of record, the quantity procured starting in FY 2019 (35,628) is representative of one fourth of the entire AAO for USMC EUDs (142,511). Unit costs increase reflects the change from spindle drive to solid state drive, the switch to a solid state drive will increase the reliability of end user devices.   FY 2017 increase from PB 2018 to PB 2019 of $22.489M is due to receipt of an Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR)for procurement of EUDs in support of WIN 10 implementation.",

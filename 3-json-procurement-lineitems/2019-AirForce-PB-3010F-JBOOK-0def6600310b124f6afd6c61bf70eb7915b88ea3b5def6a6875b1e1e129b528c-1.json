        },
        "Justification": {
            "val": "This program is a new start.\n\nProblems during Open Skies missions, combined with a lack of updated system requirements, motivated Open Skies program officials to request a Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) in July 2015 to study aircraft issues. The CBA was completed in June 2016 and indicated that key requirements in the 1992 Operational Requirements Document(ORD) were no longer current, and important requirements were not addressed in the document. It also showed the current OC-135B had capability performance gaps in range and mission completion.\n\nThe Open Skies program received permission in October 2016 to develop a Doctrine, Organization, Training, materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTmLPF-P) Change Recommendation (DCR). The DCR used a multi-disciplinary High Performance Team (HPT) to create and validate a series of required capabilities for an Open Skies aircraft, evaluate aircraft that could satisfy the required capabilities, and then consider each of the DCR elements as part of a recommended solution.\n\nThis DCR accomplishes two main purposes. First, it proposes updated required capabilities to replace the requirements in the 1992 ORD. These new required capabilities reflect both operational experience to date and expected Open Skies program needs for the foreseeable future. These new required capabilities can be satisfied by available commercial solutions.\n\nThe second is to recommend an Air Force solution that best satisfies program required capabilities. The recommendation of this DCR is for the USAF to procure or obtain two small airliner class aircraft for the Open Skies Treaty mission acquired in a method consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and other applicable guidance. The recommended training concept is for personnel to use existing contractor training facilities, equipment, and curriculum. Finally, the OCR recommends a maintenance concept for the small airliner class aircraft with military personnel performing unit-level maintenance actions and contractors responsible for other maintenance, such as parts supply, and supply chain management, performed under a Low Utilization Maintenance Program."

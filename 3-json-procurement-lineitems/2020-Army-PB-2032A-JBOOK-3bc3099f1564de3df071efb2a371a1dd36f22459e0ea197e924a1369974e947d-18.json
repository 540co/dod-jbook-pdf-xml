FY 2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy. The Budget requests these funds in OCO to comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) with Far Target Location (FTL) is a combat proven system that provides long-range, lethal anti-armor and precision assault fires capability for Active Component and Army National Guard Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) equipped with Modified ITAS (MITAS) across the spectrum of contemporary operational environments. ITAS with the TOW Missile provides the capability to defeat armored vehicles, bunkers, and buildings at extended ranges in all battlefield conditions. ITAS's superior surveillance capability also enables the Soldier to shape the battlefield by detecting targets at long range and either engaging with TOW missiles or other weapon systems to destroy those targets with its ability to generate a 10 digit grid coordinate of a target location.  The ITAS completed fielding to the total Army in December 2012.  The ITAS Image Enhancement (IE) Modification Kit reduces operator workload by optimizing the image presented to the gunner through electronic processing.  Electronic focus, image stabilization, and other processing techniques ensure that the image presented is optimized for the environment without manual manipulation of the various adjustment settings. This reduces the operations required by the gunner to achieve a consistent high quality image, reduces the time required to identify and engage targets on the battlefield.  ITAS continues to be the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements.  The TOW Weapon System includes the ITAS launcher and TOW Missiles."

This funding supports the Modified ITAS (MITAS) in the Stryker Anti-Tank Guided Missile (Stryker ATGM) vehicle. This procurement will field a single configuration across the US Army ITAS and MITAS fleets.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

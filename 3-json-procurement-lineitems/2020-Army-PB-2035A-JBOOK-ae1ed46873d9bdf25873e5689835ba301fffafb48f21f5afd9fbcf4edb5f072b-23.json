            "val": "The Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy. Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of four subsystems: Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (the system command and control station), Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (delivers anti-personnel effects).  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A soldier makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism. Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command System.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Material Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.  The Spider Army Acquisition Objective is 732 systems."

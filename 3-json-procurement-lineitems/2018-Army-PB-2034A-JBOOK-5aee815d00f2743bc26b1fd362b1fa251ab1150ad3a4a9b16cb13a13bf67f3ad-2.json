The cartridge can be fired with existing M9\/M11 pistols and M4 rifles with use of a conversion kit.  The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.  The M11 kit consists of a replacement barrel and recoil spring guide.  The M4 kit consist of a replacement upper receiver for 9mm.  A blue enameled portion of the M9, M11, and M4 barrels is visible through the ejection port of the weapons.  The projectile leaves a mark upon impact (similar to paintball), enabling after action evaluation of training scenarios.  It differs from paintball in that it is a full complete cartridge with projectile and cartridge case containing a propulsion system for a low velocity launch.  The M1041 is required to hit targets accurately out to 12 meters.  The cartridge has been safety certified to be fired in close proximity at properly protected human subjects.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.\n\n(E96107) CTG, 9MM MARKING, M1041 (RED) is used for force on force training engagements.  The cartridge can be fired with existing M9\/M11 pistols and M4 rifles with use of a conversion kit.  The M9 kit consists of a replacement barrel only.

The Ball cartridge is intended for use against enemy personnel, for training, and for force protection.  The Special Purpose cartridge is required for use in situations where limited over-penetration of targets is necessary to reduce collateral damage.  DDI cartridges are completely inert.  They are plated and drilled for easy identification and used for training and weapon familiarization.  Blank cartridges are used for K-9 training.  These items are not yet type classified or approved for service use.  The Modular Handgun System will also utilize three M1041 cartridges - Blue, Red and Yellow through the use of a weapon adapter kit.  This item is Code B, not approved for service use. \n\n(E05217) CTG, 9MM SINGLE CARTRIDGE, Dummy Drill and Inert (DDI), M917A1 ammunition cartridge is an inert (no energetic) dummy cartridge used as an ammunition training aid and for weapon familiarization.

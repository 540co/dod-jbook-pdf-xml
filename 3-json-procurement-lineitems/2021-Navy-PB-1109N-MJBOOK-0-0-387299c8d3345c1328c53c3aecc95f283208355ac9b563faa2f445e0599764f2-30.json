            "val": "BASE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (BTI) provides all Marine Corps installations with the base area network communications infrastructure that connects the end-user to the DISA network.  BTI modernizes, sustains, upgrades and enhances the telecommunications systems infrastructure  for all Marine Corps Installations in order to meet the demands required to support the 5th Element of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  BTI is designed to maintain current industry standards as they relate to technological capabilities for all voice, video and data services (both wired and wireless connections) and are transported via each installation's infrastructure.  These data services include, support for but are not limited to, Enhanced 911 (E911), Video-Teleconferencing, Integrated Services Digital Network, Marine Corps Enterprise Network, Energy Monitoring Control Systems, Intrusion Detection Systems, Access Control Systems, Fire Alarm Control Networks and Fleet Training Systems.  This includes supporting systems such as optical networks, telecommunications management systems, primary power, voice mail, teleconferencing, and outside plant infrastructure.  The ongoing focus is technology refresh and standardization on DISA Unified Capabilities (UC) (voice, video, collaboration, and data) through modernization of installation infrastructure in order to maintain connection to the DISA network. This line item includes funding specified for Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) within the above details.\n\nPUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE (PKI) is a framework of laws, policies, procedures, and technologies for the use of digital credentials, which provide confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in electronic communications and transactions. PKI allows secure access to IT systems. PKI has the ability to electronically sign documents, encrypt messages and documents, and to authenticate and protect web access... In compliance with DOD policy and direction, the USMC Public Key Infrastructure Program (PKI) program provides the resources, manpower and equipment (hardware and software), dedicated to the management (i.e.: generation, production, distribution, control, accounting and destruction) of keys and certificates used by public key-based security services to include NIPRNet and SIPRNet both garrison and deployed.  The PKI program operates the USMC Certificate Validation Infrastructure necessary to ensure that only authorized users and server based applications are allowed to operate on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN).  These services are required for user access to all information system components on the MCEN including network accounts, applications and web sites.  PKI must be operable in garrison and tactical\/deployed environments.  Beginning in FY20, PKI was transferred to a new procurement line item, 4645 Cyberspace Activities, in order to consolidate Marine Corps Cyberspace Procurement Activities into one LI. \n\nCONSOLIDATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (CERS) is a centrally managed program to field a technology solution in support of emergency dispatch personnel that facilitates timely responses when emergency calls for service are received.  CERS provides command and coordination dispatch functions for first responders to support All-Hazard missions.  It standardizes Emergency Dispatch Centers to provide notification functions, resource management and situational awareness in order to increase efficient emergency and day-to-day first responder operations.  CERS capability is achieved through delivery of Enhanced 911 (E911) and emergency dispatch capabilities consisting of Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD), Fire Station Alerting (FSA) and Mobile Data Computers (MDC) for first responder's vehicles. \n  \nENTERPRISE LAND MOBILE RADIOS (E-LMR) is a modern, digital, Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 Trunked radio system at all Marine Corps Bases, Posts and Stations (BPS).   It provides the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) communications that are required to support the Consolidated Emergency Response System and First Responders (i.e. Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services) as part of the Emergency Management Command and Coordination initiative.  Specifically, the radio system provides RF coverage to BPS populated areas and roads in-between, permitting positive command and coordination between Dispatchers and First Responders and enables their ability to respond to incidents during normal, crisis, and recovery operations.  In the wake of 9\/11 and the Ft. Hood incident, DoD recognized that effective emergency communications and mutual aid support operation are key elements in providing homeland security, reducing the loss of life and the preservation of property.  Thus, the objective for the E-LMR acquisition is to bring forth a reliable interoperability wireless communication system with a limited data capability. This line item includes funding specified for Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) within the above details.\n\nTEST, EVALUATION, & ENGINEER ENVIRONMENT (T&E) is a Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) provides the only Marine Corps organic, operationally relevant, MAGTF Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) architecture for testing and engineering tasks. This environment is the sole organic solution in the Marine Corps for Link-16 Tactical Data Link Networks for air-to- air, ship, and shore targeting and messaging, validated at MCTSSA before Marine\/Navy use in theater. The environment also provides Marine Corps organic equipment, environments, operators, and testers for Joint Communications Exercises, Joint Interoperability Testing, and Systems of System testing. Funding supports modernization and expansion of the MAGTF Systems Integration Environment at MCTSSA for non-Table of Equipment items: Communications Backbone, Test Tool\/Data Collection Hardware\/Software, and Computers. The environment is essential to operating forces support for fielded C4I systems, as well as evaluating USMC and Joint C4I systems in a controlled, repeatable, and re-configurable manner that reduces program risk and identifies significant deficiencies prior to fielding to the operating forces. More than forty Marine Corps C4I programs and systems rely on\nMCTSSA support.\n\nMARINE CORPS INFORMATION OPERATIONS PROGRAM (MCIOP) provides MAGTF commanders and the Marine Corps a responsive and effective full-spectrum information operations (IO) planning and psychological operations delivery capability by means of deployable support teams and a comprehensive general support IO reach-back capability in order to integrate IO into Marine Corps operations.  Multiple classification levels require separate Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to support each classification level in accordance with National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency standards.  This includes equipment necessary for connecting internal MCIOC IT infrastructure (voice, video, and data) with the existing Marine Corps Base Quantico support infrastructure."

If this equipment is not replaced then these antiquated end of life mobile radios would prevent USMC First Responders and Range and Training Area personnel from achieving operational mission support to protect life and property on USMC Installations.  Cost Element 4.1 funding increase of $0.129M from FY 2020 is due to the ramp up of MBR refresh in FY 2021.\n\nEastern Region Infrastructure (ERI) Refresh (Cost Element 4.3) funding increase of $4.204M from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is due to the start of ERI refresh in FY 2021. This cost element will provide for the replacement of equipment that will be going end of life, if this equipment is not replaced then it will impact the first responders ability to carry out their missions. This equipment is required to ensure that First Responders are able to effectively communicate and respond to emergencies in a timely manner. The program is on a 7 year refresh cycle and its current equipment is becoming obsolete and requires immediate replacement and modernization.\n\nFielding Activities (Cost Element 4.6) $3.070M.  Funding provides for the fielding activities associated with the multi-band radio (MBR) technical refresh and the Eastern Region Infrastructure (ERI) refresh. Fielding Activities (Cost Element 4.6) increase of $2.025M from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is due to the start of the Eastern Region Infrastructure (ERI) tech refresh. This cost element provides fielding support for the ongoing fielding efforts for ELMR.  \n\nE-LMR DPRI (Cost Element 4.8) $0.136M. Funding increased $0.103M from FY 2020 to FY 2021, funding is required to procure equipment to expand the current ELMR network that supports JRM.  JRM provides ELMR support for all DOD and Federal organizations on the island of Guam.  ELMR expansion is vital to supporting the relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.\n\nFunding in this line item has been reprioritized while ensuring the Marine Corps continues to evolve toward a Force that is aligned with the National Defense Strategy."

It is a self-propelled and articulated framed steering vehicle with an open bowl, two axles, a single diesel engine and pneumatic tires. The 14-18 Cubic Yard, Earth moving Heavy Scraper has the ability to self-load at a reduced production capacity. It provides a hauling and dumping capability to perform efficient tasks in support of earth moving projects. The 14-18 Cubic Yard, Earth moving Heavy Scraper is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) program that provides Army Engineers with essential equipment to perform their road and airfield construction and site preparation missions. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 668; with 200 Armor Kits.   \n\nConstruction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVT) are commercial off the shelf virtual training devices with software modifications for military unique tasks.  These simulators enable the United States Army Engineer School with the capability to more effectively train Engineer Military Occupational Skill (MOS), while reducing maintenance of actual equipment and fuel costs during traditional training.  These simulators provide the Engineer Warfighter with a multitude of training scenarios and continuous hands on training on a variety of construction equipment and in various simulated conditions.  Use of CEVT increases skills and competency in the operation of equipment.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the Heavy Scraper CEVT is 33."

            "val": "The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The system captures and provides data for future medical care and medical record retention for all Servicemembers.  The MC4 system fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed Servicemembers' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance, enabling each soldier to have a comprehensive, life-long medical record of all illnesses and injuries. The collection and analysis of medical data provided by the MC4 system provides and enhances medical situational awareness for mission commanders.  The MC4 program is currently in full fielding of integrated Information Management\/Information Technology (IM\/IT) equipment.  The MC4 system is comprised of seven Line item Numbers (LINs) and is fielded to all Army units with medical assets.  The mix of LINs fielded to any unit is directly related to the unit's medical function and will differ dependent on the type of unit.  \n\nIn prior years, MC4 has procured and fielded equipment aligned with the incremental development of the jointly developed Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) electronic health record software.  As software increments have evolved to a final objective state (available in FY17), MC4 hardware has been replaced and upgraded to support the capability provided by the upgraded software increments and releases. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) includes all seven MC4 LINs to be fielded which will operate the final version of the TMIP-J software and totals 39,883 LIN quantities of the MC4 system."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $15.964 million supports production engineering, fielding and new equipment training for new systems.  In addition, overall program office management efforts are funded in this appropriation.  Base funding in FY18 is required to continue fielding remaining gaps of MC4 capability to the Army medical force structure.  FY18 funding will procure 121 end components of the MC4 system for upgraded and new equipment fielding and provide new equipment training (NET) as needed for 11 Active units (1 engineering company, 2 military police units, 2 engineering companies, 2 maneuver enhancement brigades,1 veterinary medical unit, 1 aviation unit, 2 civil affairs units). The system is fielded and trained to units as they prepare for deployment or other priority missions.  The medical encounters captured by the MC4 system will provide the Soldiers' electronic health record as well as data to databases and systems that enable commanders to: identify population health trends and outbreaks; reallocate human and materiel resources based on needs; determine if locations are the source of illnesses or injuries; and make better tactical and medical decisions that impact the mission and Soldiers' health.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)(P.L. 110-181) this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing the military support to civil authorities."

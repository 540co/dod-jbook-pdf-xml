The DISN, seamlessly spanning full spectrum from terrestrial to space and strategic to tactical domains, provides the interoperable telecommunications connectivity and value-added services required to plan, implement, and support all operational missions, anytime, and anywhere pushing DISN services to the edge of the communications network.  The DISN delivers an integrated platform consisting of DoD's core communications, computing, and information services as well as integrating terrestrial, wireless, and satellite communications into a network cloud that is survivable and dynamically scalable.  Procurement funding primarily supports the Technology Refreshment (TR); Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS); National Emergency Action Decision Network (NEADN)\/Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC); the Enhanced Pentagon Capability (EPC)\/Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN); DoD Mobility; and a significant satellite communications extension of the DISN.  The procurement funding enables the DISN to remain technologically up-to date and capable by achieving the best possible balance between network performance and network cost through a process known as network optimization."

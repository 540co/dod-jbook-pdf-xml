        "Description": {
            "val": "The program provides Naval mines for use as anti-ship or anti-submarine subsurface weapons.  \n\nThe Naval mining capability consists of the QUICKSTRIKE (QS) mine, the Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM), and the modified Clandestine Delivered Mine (CDM). \n\nThe Quickstrike is a family of shallow water, aircraft laid mines used primarily against surface and subsurface craft.  The QUICKSTRIKE family of delivered mines has 3 variants based on size - the MK 62, MK 63, and MK 65.  The MK 62 and MK 63 (500 lb. and 1000 lb.) QS are created by adding mine hardware to the MK 82 and MK 83 general purpose bomb (respectively) to form a mine.  The MK 65 (2000 lb.) QS consists entirely of hardware designed for use as a mine.   The Mod 0, 1, and 3 variants utilize various Target Detection Devices (TDD).  The QS Mod 3 utilizes a newly developed TDD MK 71, a software-programmable device capable of being programmed to optimize detection of new threats.  For the QUICKSTRIKE MK 62 and 63, the QS Mod 3 Kit consists of the TDD (including the service and dummy MK 71), Safe\/Arming (S&A) devices (including the service MK 75, practice MK 81, and dummy MK 84), battery (MK 176), TDD Adapter Ring MK 163,  and miscellaneous hardware.  For the QUICKSTRIKE MK 65, the Mod 3 Kit consists of the TDD (including the service and dummy MK 71), the existing S&A devices (including the service MK 45 and practice and dummy S&A devices), the existing batteries MK 131 or 132, TDD Adapter MK 157, and miscellaneous hardware.  Additional support hardware for the QS MK 62\/63\/65 Mod 3 includes Test Set MK 650 and Programmer MK 11.  The MK 67 SLMM is the only submarine launched variant. The CDM uses existing SLMM components to provide a mine with potential to be delivered by unmanned maritime platforms."

            "val": "FY 2018 provides funding for the baseline program supporting mining capabilities for the US Navy which are deployed by multiple aircraft vehicles or are submarine launched. FY 2018 increase in funding also provides for procurement of all necessary hardware and support equipment for the Quickstrike Mod 3 series of weapons including the TDD MK 71 and Safe and Arming (S&A) MK 75 for the Quickstrike MK 62 and MK 63 variants to support warfighter requirements."

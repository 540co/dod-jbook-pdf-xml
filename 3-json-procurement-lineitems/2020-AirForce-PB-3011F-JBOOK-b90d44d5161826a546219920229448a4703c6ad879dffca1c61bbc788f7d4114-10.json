            "val": "FY2020 funding totals include $0.0M for Base and $1.291M for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO); of which $1.291M is realigned as part of the OCO for Base Requirements. FY2020 OCO for Base Requirements is OCO funding for base budget requirements in support of the National Defense Strategy.  The Budget requests these funds in OCO to comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThis budget line encompasses both new and on-going modification efforts for guided bomb and munitions systems. Permanent modifications consist of configuration changes to in-service systems and equipment which correct material or other deficiencies and can be used to add or remove capability. Safety modifications correct deficiencies which may create personnel, system, or equipment hazards. \n\nThe Air Force procures munitions to maintain appropriate quantities in the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Munitions and test and training stockpiles. Active, Guard and Reserve components draw from the WRM stockpiles as required and receive test and training allocations annually based on current-year requirements.\n\nFunds may be used to resolve production DMS\/MS\/Obsolescence issues through studies, bridge buys, life of type buys, supplier\/parts replacement, to include electronic components used commercially and in short supply, and qualification activities to preserve future production capabilities and capacities.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0208030F.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

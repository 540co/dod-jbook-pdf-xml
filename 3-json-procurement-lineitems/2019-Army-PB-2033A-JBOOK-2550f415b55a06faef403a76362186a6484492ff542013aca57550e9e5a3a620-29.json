            "val": "The Lightweight 155mm Howitzer System (LW155) provides direct, reinforcing and general artillery fire support to maneuver forces. The M777A2 is a towed 155mm Howitzer jointly developed by the Army and Marine Corps to replace the M198 Howitzer. The extensive use of titanium in all its major structures makes it 7,000 pounds lighter than the M198 with no sacrifice in range, stability, accuracy or durability. The M777A2's independent suspension, smaller footprint and lower profile increase strategic deployability and tactical mobility. The system uses numerous improvements to enhance reliability and accuracy, and significantly increase system survivability. The system has a Digital Fire Control System (DFCS) that includes an inertial navigation unit with Global Positioning System backup to allow it to self-locate. The DFCS also includes a mission computer, displays and digital communications. Software upgrades incorporating the Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuse Setter and the Excalibur Platform Integration Kit hardware give the M777A2 the capability to program and fire the Excalibur precision-guided munition.  Several ongoing modifications to enhance durability will increase the longevity of the M777A2. The LW155 offers the warfighter improved survivability, lethality, deployability and mobility to counter threat forces.\n\nThe Army has fielded the M777A2 to their Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, Fires Brigades and the National Guard.  The Army began fielding the M777A2 to Infantry Brigade Combat Teams starting in FY 2014 and completed in FY 2018. The Marine Corps fielded to all active and reserve units, and there have been additional Foreign Military Sales purchases from Australia, Canada, and India."

            "val": "FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.086 million continues to support retrofits of previously contracted Engineering Change Proposals for items such as the Improved Power Conditioning Control Module (I-PCCM), Electronic Thermal Warning Device (ETWD), Hydraulic Power Assist Kit (HyPAK), Muzzle Velocity Sensor System (MVSS), Mission Computer (MSC-R), Chief of Section Display (CSD-R) and Primer Feed Mechanism (PFM) Components. The PFM and ETWD retrofits are critical to addressing current field restrictions for firing the Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) at extended ranges. The Digital Fire Control System software will also be upgraded as part of these retrofits. The upgraded software requires additional operator training as it reflects significant changes to operator tactics and procedures.  Other modifications included in the retrofit activities include chrome cannon tubes.  The chrome tubes increase system durability and mitigate residue issues when firing the Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS).\n\n\"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.\""

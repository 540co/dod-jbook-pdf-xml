            "val": "The CV-22 is the US Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. The aircraft provides long-range infiltration, exfiltration, and re-supply of SOF in politically sensitive and hostile\/denied areas. The Navy is the lead service for the joint V-22 program and has overall responsibility for managing all V-22 variants, including the Air Force CV-22 variant. \n\nCV-22 post production support funding enables the seamless transition from the production phase of the program to the operations and support (O&S) phase. Post Production support funding is required to procure support equipment and integrated logistics support (ILS) requirements affiliated with sustainment of CV-22 modifications to improve operational effectiveness, readiness, and aircraft availability of the worldwide CV-22 fleet.\n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0401318F.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

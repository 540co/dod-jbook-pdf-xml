The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. Life cycle replacement will be required to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber security requirements and posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.\n\nNATIONAL CAPITOL REGION - INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): NCR-IADS is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability that improves low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR. NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capitol Region airspace, and provides an integrated air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the warfighter mission to protect the NCR. Life cycle replacement will be required, to prevent system obsolescence, account for new cyber security requirements and posture the program to seamlessly integrate future capabilities.\n\nBATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM MODERNIZATION: Provides for capital equipment replacement activities at the fixed Air Defense Sectors under the modification efforts for Release 3.2.5 and beyond, which include, but are not limited to: infrastructure upgrades, future Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and replacement of other equipment that does not qualify for Centralized Asset Management (CAM) funding."

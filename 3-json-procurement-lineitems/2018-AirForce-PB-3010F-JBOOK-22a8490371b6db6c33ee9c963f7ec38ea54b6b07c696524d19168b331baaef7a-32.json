            "val": "1.  The Air Force Industrial Preparedness program element combines the resources of several appropriations (Aircraft Procurement, Missile Procurement, and Operation and Maintenance) to create a comprehensive program that aids in ensuring the defense industry can supply reliable, affordable systems to operational commanders.  The Aircraft Procurement part of Industrial Preparedness support 1) management and upkeep of government-owned industrial plants; 2) management of industrial base assessments; and 3) environmental compliance program at government-owned industrial plants.\n\n2. Three basic activities are funded in this appropriation: Industrial Facilities, Industrial Base Assessments and Environmental Activities (Environmental Compliance).\n\nIndustrial Facility Capital Type Rehabilitation cost element (MPC 3000): Provides for repair and expansion, major capital rehabilitation, construction, demolition, equipment movement and energy conservation at government-owned, contractor-operated industrial facilities.  These plants are the backbone of defense weapon system assembly and maintenance for the B-21, B-2, U-2, F-16, F-15SA, P-3 C-130, C-5B, RQ-4 Global Hawk, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter & classified programs.\n\nIndustrial Base Assessment cost element (MPC 6000): Provides for the identification, analysis and assessment of industrial base concerns dealing with aircraft research and development, production, and sustainment.  These assessments provide timely and accurate industrial base information to support Air Force decisions on 1) aircraft weapon system acquisition risks; 2) budget allocation investments; 3) weapon system sustainment and logistics support; and 4) defense industry mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures.  Supports joint-Service industrial base planning on shared commodities, technologies, and facilities.\n\nEnvironmental compliance cost element (MPC 7000) provides for the efforts needed to maintain compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements regarding operation of the government-owned contractor-operated industrial facilities.\n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 78011F."

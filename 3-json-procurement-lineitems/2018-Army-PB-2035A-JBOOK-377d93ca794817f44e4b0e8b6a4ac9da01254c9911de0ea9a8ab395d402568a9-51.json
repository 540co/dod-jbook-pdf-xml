            "val": "Product Lead Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) manages two Army biometric tactical collection devices, the Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) Kit and BAT-A Handheld (HH).  These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system is the Army\u2019s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known & Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.\n\nUnited States Central Command (CENTCOM) submitted JUONS CC-0548 on 11 Dec 15 for enhanced biometric capabilities to support current operations.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated 5 of 6 key requirements of JUONS CC-0548 on 3 June 2016 and identified the requirements as \"key enablers\" to existing JEON CCE-0008 (near Real-Time Identity Operations).  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) assigned execution responsibility for the validated 5 key requirements in JUONS CC-0548 to the Army on 30 June 2016.  The Army Acquisition Executive assigned OPR to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors\/Project Manager for DoD Biometrics on 13 September 2016."

            "val": "FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) procurement in the amount of $5.180 million procures multiple Biometric Automated Toolsets - Army (BAT-A) Kit Hardware and BAT-A Handheld (HH) accessories for quantities RESET\/REFRESH activities supporting both Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and Operation Inherent Resolve for ISIL (OIR).  Specifically for OFS, requested funds will refresh 204 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals; refresh six (6) BAT-A Servers with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A Handheld obsolete parts and accessories ensuring the continued mission critical capability.  Specifically for OIR, requested funds will refresh 63 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals; refresh two (2) BAT-A Servers with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A Handheld obsolete parts and accessories ensuring the continued mission critical capability.\n\nThe Biometric Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A) requires both hardware reset and associated minor software integration to maintain operational viability.  These devices have been in Iraq and Afghanistan well beyond the standard 3 \u2013 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  BAT-A is the Army's Biometric Program of Record and failure to reset these devices will degrade the mission effectiveness of this enabler of Identity Dominance and Force Protection."

            "val": "Funding in this P-1 line provides Non-Propulsion Electronics equipment that will be installed aboard TRIDENT Class submarines as part of the Obsolete Equipment Replacement (OER) Program.\n\nOER Program is the replacement of existing hardware\/software that, though functional, has become operationally obsolete, is no longer in production or supportable with spare parts, or has a high failure rate making them no longer cost effective to maintain.  OER hardware\/software changes are expected to provide significant cost savings via reduced maintenance costs and use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology wherever possible as long as all technical requirements are met.\n\nThis funding line includes performance of the required fully integrated system level testing and certification of changes to the TRIDENT Combat systems prior to installation of the changes on the ship.  Integrated testing and certification provides assurance that when the changes are installed in the ship, the TRIDENT Combat system will operate as designed, allowing the ships to maintain their operational schedules and mission capabilities.\n\n[P40A \/ CCS Revision Engineering Cert\/Test]: This program develops upgrades to legacy systems to maintain required interface connectivity to other Program Acquisition Resource Manager (PARM)-managed subsystems in response to PARMs modernizations, or to address obsolescence, or where mandated requirement changes (example Cyber security) drive changes to hardware or software."

The program resolves Data Processing Subsystem (DPS) obsolescence issues and conjunctively supports the upgrade of the SSBN legacy CCS to the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) architecture common with the SSN\/SSGN classes. Collectively, the DPS and SWFTS upgrades modify Fire Control, SONAR, Voyage Management System (VMS), RADAR, Tactical Navigation, and Periscopes, and collaterally impact Ship Control, Monitoring Subsystem, and interfaces to ship sensors such as speed, depth, and Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communication navigation data. The DPS upgrade includes replacing all UYK-43 computers, DPS workstation, TRIDENT Signal Data Converters (TSDC), and the UGC-143 with a modified Electronic Control Display Unit (ECDU). The ECDU is common equipment on VA Class and planned for the COLUMBIA Class. The ECDU requires hardware and software development to interface to the Strategic Weapon System (SWS) Navigation and maintain critical Ship to SWS interface requirements. The ECDU and all the associated CCS architecture modifications are required to be installed conjunctively with SWFTS. Continued operation of the SSBN strategic mission will require the implementation of the ECDU upgrade along with the SWFTS upgrade.",

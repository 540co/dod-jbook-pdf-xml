            "val": "The AMC Critical Items Program oversees the process by which Class II and VII end items that are out of production and, consequently, now under AMC management, are re-procured to fill shortages.  The program supports major end-item (weapon system) inventory management through item managers.  The program requirements represent actual and projected equipment deficiencies and do not include obsolete items or items replaced by modernized successors managed by G8.\n\nThe Army Materiel Command (AMC) identifies Table of Organizational Equipment (TOE) items with identifiable line item numbers (LINs) that have valid unit requirements and support Army force generation requirements. These LINs are in the sustainment phase of their life cycle and are no longer being acquired by the Army.  In some cases there is a production base because of commercial, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or other service demands.  The Army prioritizes these items and determines that the systems requested herein are key to supporting current operations.\n\nLIN H01907: The AN\/ASM-146 Repair Shelter is an air transportable, mobile field maintenance facility that provides repair capability at the BCT level for all Commmunications-Electronics (C-E) systems and equipment and is critical to maintaining C-E readiness in the battlefield.\n\nLIN P40750: Power Supply PP-6224, LIN P40750 is a power supply that furnishes 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32 Vdc from nominal 115\/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.  The power supply can also operate from a 24 Vdc storage battery in the battery standby mode.  It is the Army standard tactical 24V DC power source for C-E equipment in Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) as well as equipment dismounted from vehicles."

The equipment supports training  for intelligence officers, geospatial analysts, targeteers, operations analysts, linguists, network analysts, and all communications (except communications security) and electronic intelligence analysts. The systems support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications.  The major focus of the systems is to provide the sole source for functional training on the newest generation of intelligence systems with an emphasis on computer-based training systems through modeling and simulation.  This equipment is critical in preparing military intelligence personnel to support warfighting commanders and the National Intelligence Program (NIP).   The equipment supports enterprise-wide intelligence training for Air Force (AF), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Joint\/Coalition Partner personnel at Goodfellow Air Force Base (GAFB), Texas. \n\nPE 0804733F GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SKILL TRAINING (GIST)\n\nGOODFELLOW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING ARCHITECTURE (GITA) UPGRADE:   Continues to incorporate new equipment to support the development of the enterprise architecture, consolidating multiple networks and systems into a single integrated GITA. \n\nFunding for this exhibit contained in PE 0804733F."

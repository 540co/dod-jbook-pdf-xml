            "val": "The Director of the Undersea Warfare Division (N97) has ordered the reconstitution and integration of 60 Encapsulated (ENCAP) Harpoon BLK II missile systems for the 688 class submarine fleet in order to provide over the horizon surface strike capabilities to the fleet. The ENCAP Harpoon missiles provide Navy Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarines (SSN) a sub-launched, all-weather, long-range Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missile to attack enemy warships at stand-off ranges, to include Surface and Amphibious Action Groups.  There are currently retired Encapsulated Harpoons located at the Letterkenny Army Depot that are candidates for reconstitution and delivery to the submarine fleet.  In order to accomplish this order, the ENCAP program will refurbish and recertify existing ENCAP H1C All Up Rounds from deep storage to an 'as new' war ready material condition.  (ENCAP Harpoons were placed in deep storage in 1996).  The controlled storage conditions achieved by the missile capsule have preserved the material condition of the weapon system, allowing for relatively quick recertification and reissue. Due to the ease and speed of missile recertification the ENCAP Harpoon Reconstitution Program will fill a critical, time sensitive ASuW capability gap and meet Speed to the Fleet requirements."

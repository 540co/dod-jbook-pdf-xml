Funds will include a portfolio of CDRL's, Halotron bottles and Halotron carts to continue implementing tasks required from FRP decision. Additionally, programmatic oversight (production\/progress reviews) and logistics supportability (FRET- FDT) of those production vehicles is required in support of P-19 for the P-19R vehicles. The ordering period for the contract expires in FY18.  Decrease of $55.0M from FY17 to FY18 is a result of a realignment of funds into FY17 to accelerate procurement of 68 P-19 vehicles (for a total of 126) in FY17.\n\nCommercial Passenger Vehicles - $11.489M - Funding will be used to procure vehicles such as buses and sedans for the required replacements of passenger vehicles that have exceeded the recommended service life for Marine Corps Installations Pacific (MCIPAC); and to support the operation and mission of the USMC OCONUS (Japan) commands.

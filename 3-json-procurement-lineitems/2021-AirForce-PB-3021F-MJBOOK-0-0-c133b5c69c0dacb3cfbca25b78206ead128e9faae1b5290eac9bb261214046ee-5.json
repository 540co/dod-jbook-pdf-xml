            "val": "In FY2021, P-1 Line Item GNRLIT\/General Information Technology efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3022, Procurement, Space Force, from Appropriation 3021 due to the creation of a new Appropriation for Space Force.\n\nPE 1203173F Space and Missile Test and Evaluation Center (SAMTEC)\nThe Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Innovation and Prototyping Directorate at Kirtland AFB (KAFB), NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in support of prototype, experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites at the RDT&E Support Complex (RSC) and Mobile Range (MRF) at KAFB and at Schriever AFB (SAFB), CO. The RDSMO program develops, acquires, delivers, integrates, tests, operates, and sustains the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) satellite command and control (C2) Ground System Enterprise (GSE) and fixed\/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions and transitions designated satellite missions to the operational command upon user needs. In addition RDSMO supports the deployment and sustainment of Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) in multiple locations as US Space Force systems transition to an Enterprise-based ground C2. Funds in the General Information Technology (Space) line procures Information Technology products to support RDSMO.\n\nSpace acquisition must respond with speed and agility to emerging adversary threats.  Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is transforming the organization and implementation of space acquisition to an enterprise approach, maximizing innovation and resiliency, leveraging international, commercial, and mission partnerships, and managing program\/project priorities according to an integrated unclassified \/classified  enterprise space architecture.  Expanding the appropriate acquisition authorities and contract mechanism to deliver capability sooner, SMC will strategically execute experimentation, prototyping, risk reduction, and other efforts to develop new, or repurpose capabilities.\n\nPE 1203174F Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development\nLocated at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development (SIIRTD) program supports the AFSPC Space Analysis Center Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system. AVAC is a stand-alone system that provides a crosscutting capability to conduct, support, and report analysis on a myriad of tools, data, models and simulations. This system allows leadership to make decisions based on quantifiable operational impacts output from AVAC based on various vignettes and studies applied to space and cyber assets. Funding buys system-specific hardware, software, routers, licenses, etc., to maintain the efficiency and compatibility with all current models.\n\nDISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATIONS ARCHITECTURE:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Distributed Communications Architecture.  This system provides a network-based communications capability enabling dispersed space personnel to participate in space exercises and wargames and to assist in development, testing, and validation of SIIRTD innovation projects supporting the Combat Air Forces.  It can also support limited command and control capabilities for space operations.\n\nSPACE ANALYSIS CENTER:  Procures Information Technology (IT) hardware & software infrastructure for the Air Force Space Command Virtual Analysis Capability (AVAC) system.  The system provides classified modeling and simulation tools for the AFSPC Space Analysis Center to conduct operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Related modeling and simulation tool development is funded in RDT&E, AF, PE 1203174F, Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development."

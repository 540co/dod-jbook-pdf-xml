            "val": "The B-52 Combat Network Communication Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with data link and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. The CONECT upgrade installs new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs) and a digital interphone system, which will survive and function through the nuclear environment to enhance crew interaction and situational awareness. To enable net centric operations, the CONECT upgrade installs on-board client\/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  UHF Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability via ARC-210 Warrior radio to exchange J-Series messaging within theater; Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, email and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) data link to significantly enhance close air support (CAS) missions. This integrated suite, when produced and installed, will provide the B-52 fleet with a machine-to-machine capability supporting aircraft re-tasking and re-targeting of Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and J-series weapons across the range of military operations the B-52 is assigned. \n  \nThis modification is planned to be done in conjunction with Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM).  In addition, training devices will be upgraded to include CONECT functionality to meet user training requirements.\n\nPost Production Support funds Interim Contract Support (ICS) until the depot is established for CONECT.  \n\nThis program has associated Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding in PE 0101113F."

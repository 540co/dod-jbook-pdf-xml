The C-9B is capable of carrying up to 32,000 pounds of cargo and personnel for over 1,739 nautical miles. The C-40A can accommodate 121 passengers, or 8 pallets of cargo, or a combination configuration of 3 pallets and 70 passengers with a range of 3,400 nautical miles.  The C-20G can accommodate 26 passengers or all pallets of cargo, or a combination of pallets and passengers with a range of 5,130 nautical miles.   The C-20D and C-37 provide worldwide executive transport to Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Fleet Commanders.  The UC-35 provides transport for high priority passenger\/cargo missions with time, place or mission sensitive requirements.  The UC-35 can accommodate 6 passengers or 1,200 pounds of cargo with a range of 1,300 nautical miles.  The C-12 King Air and C-26 Metro variants are commercial twin turbo-prop aircraft that provide shorter-range light lift passenger\/cargo transport and range control missions.  The C-12 is capable of carrying 6 passengers or maximum cargo capacity of 2,850 pounds, with a range of 1,075 nautical miles. The C-26 is capable of carrying 19 passengers 1,300 nautical miles.\n\nIn FY12-FY17 Block 2 aircraft modifications will occur.  Some of the systems affected by Block 2 are Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, Runway Awareness and Advisory System, UniLink 800\/801Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, Protected Mode and Baseline Controller Pilot Data Link Communication and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract datalink, VHF Data Link Mode 2 for aircraft that have not been approved for exemption, Satellite Communications capability (Iridium or International Maritime Satellite) and services.  In FY15 - FY21 Block 3 aircraft modifications include Automatic Dependent Surveillance to DO260B standards, Data Link recording capability that is tied to the Cockpit Voice Recorder, Expansion of data link systems\/services based on global operational data-link mandates, integration of AN\/APX-119 IFF Mode 5 with new digital control panel, Performance based navigation (RNAV\/RNP), weather radar integration, L5 GLS capabilities, SATCOM upgrades required to meet new Iridium or International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) requirements.  To combat jamming of commercial navigation systems incorporate anti jamming GPS antenna systems with M-code. In FY22 - FY25 Block 4 aircraft modifications include Flight Management System upgrades to meet FAA advanced RNP minimum performance standards, Continue with incorporation of anti jam and anti spoofing M-Code GPS to ensure secure transmission of accurate military signals."

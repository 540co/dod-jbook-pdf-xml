            "val": "This Robotic Combat Support System (RCSS) Budget line procures the M160 Mine Flail and the Route Clearance and Interrogation System (RCIS) Type I. \n\nThe M160 is a 6.1-ton tracked, combat engineer vehicle designed for teleoperation by soldiers from either mounted or dismounted positions to perform area clearance of antipersonnel mine-sown areas. The revised Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 72. The M160 detonates or destroys anti-personnel mines in a 68-inch wide path through the action of a rotating chain and hammer flail system. The M160 provides standoff and increased protection for engineer units conducting route and area clearance missions. It fills the Light Flail mission in the Area Clearance Family of Systems. The M160 is a program of record, developed from a modified Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) system. \n\nThe Route Clearance and Interrogation System (RCIS) Type I and Type II will enable an operator to semi-autonomously control (tele-operate) a High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) and an RG-31, Medium Mine Protected Vehicle. The RCIS Type I enables the Soldier to semi-autonomously control a HMEE, enabling operators to interrogate, classify and excavate deep buried explosive hazards, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and caches in a wide range of road surfaces and soil conditions from a standoff distance for Soldier protection. The RCIS Type I AAO is 266.  The RCIS Type II enables Soldiers to semi-autonomously control the RG-31 and its route clearance payloads from another Route Clearance vehicle. The RCIS Type II AAO is 350. RCIS procurement is scheduled to start in FY20."

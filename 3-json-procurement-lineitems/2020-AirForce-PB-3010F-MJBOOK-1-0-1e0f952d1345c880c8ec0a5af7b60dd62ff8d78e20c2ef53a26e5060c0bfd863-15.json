            "val": "The four-engine C-5 carries outsized and heavy cargo (tanks, helicopters, etc.) between main operating bases.  Additionally, the aircraft is capable of carrying 73 troops and 36 standard 463-L pallets. \n\nThe C-5 fleet was delivered to the Air Force from 1969 to 1989.  The aircraft's initial service life was 30,000 flight hours.  The Air Force started converting 52 C-5A, B and C aircraft to the C-5M in October 2004 under the C-5 Reliability and Re-engining Program (RERP).  The final C-5M  delivered in August 2018.  This modernization effort extends the service life of the C-5 out to 2040 with an expected service life of 51,025 flight hours.\n\nAs of March 2019, the C-5 inventory consists of 52 C-5M aircraft. All C-5A have been retired.  \n\nFunding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401119F. No Budget Year FY20 funding requested.\n\nAs directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2018 Air Force penalty total is $14.373M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account."

            "val": "This program covers various types of Construction Equipment (CE) where the acquisition cost for each line item is below $5.0 million. These programs provide the enhanced capabilities to the current force enabling them to execute their expeditionary mission to include:\n\n1. Route Remediation is a system of systems that provide engineer units the capability to quickly repair damaged or improve worn routes throughout unit assigned areas of responsibility.  This system consists of:\n\n--The Portable Asphalt Patcher (PAP) is a highly mobile, self-contained, spray injection asphalt patcher built on an M1077 flat rack.  It mixes aggregate with asphalt emulsion and dispenses the mixture into a repair area for a patch that is traffic ready within 20 minutes. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 7 systems.\n\n--The Self Propelled Concrete Saw (SPCS) is fully operational and controlled by one person. The SPCS fills capability gaps for engineer teams to effectively conduct rapid, expedient, route repair in support of assured mobility.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 62 systems.\n\n--The Portable Concrete Mixer (PCM) is a towable, fully functional, and independently powered volumetric concrete mixer. It provides continuous operation with a minimum concrete production capacity of 2 cubic yards and has a 250 gallon minimum on-board pressurized water system. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 268 systems.\n\n--The Machine Powered Mowing System (MPMS) is a commercial front mounted boom attachment for the 966H, Wheeled Loader. The MPMS is a telescoping, high-powered mowing attachment used to rapidly remove ground cover, foliage, grass, weeds, and underbrush.  The MPMS is interoperable with the armored and non-armored polycarbonate windowed variants of the 966H loader, and is transported via M916 and M870 while attached to the machine.  Each system is fielded with the following three attachments:  one 60-inch mower head attachment, one 4-blade saw, and one ditching attachment. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 66 systems.\n\n2.  The Water Well Drilling Rig (WWDR) is a four piece system consisting of a self-propelled drilling rig, support\/tender truck, a mud trailer and an air compressor trailer.  The system will be used to produce water where surface or commercial sources do not exist.  The drilling rig is a hydraulic, top-head driven unit with a telescoping mast capable of employing a standard 20 feet 8 inch drill steel string to a depth of 2000 feet.  The rig carries the initial 500 feet of drill steel.  The support\/tender truck has a 2500-gallon water tank, an auxiliary 500-gallon fuel tank, a crane, and the capacity to carry 1500 feet in additional drill steel.  The air compressor trailer is utilized for drilling and retrieving drill steel based upon geographical situations.  The mud trailer contains a mixing\/cleaning system.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 8 systems."

            "val": "FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $6.899 million procures 33 Route Remediation systems and 1 Water Well Drilling System.  This equipment allows Engineer Construction units to meet Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO) and Stability Reconstruction Operation (S&RO) requirements.  Funding supports a balanced investment strategy for the Army's approved force structure and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) requirements.  Funding activities also include Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), Technical Manuals, Support Equipment, Fielding and Program Management Support costs.\n\nIn accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."

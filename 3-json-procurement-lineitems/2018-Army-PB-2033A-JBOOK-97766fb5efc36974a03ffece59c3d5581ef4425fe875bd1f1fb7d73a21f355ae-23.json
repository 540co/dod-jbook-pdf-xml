The CROWS system includes a three axis stabilized mount, a sensor suite with fire control software, and a vehicle integration kit.  CROWS permits the gunner to manipulate the sight and weapon from under armor using a hand controller and a flat panel display.  Missions can be carried out under conditions of varying visibility via the day camera or thermal camera.  The laser range finder and three-axis stabilization allows for accurate fire on the move."

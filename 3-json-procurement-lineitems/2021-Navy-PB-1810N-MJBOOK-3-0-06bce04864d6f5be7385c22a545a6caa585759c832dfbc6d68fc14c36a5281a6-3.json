            "val": "The Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC) and Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS) are components of the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) required to plan and execute Tomahawk strikes.\n\nThe Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC) consists of Commercial and Government Off-The-Shelf (COTS\/GOTS) software and COTS hardware. TMPC is the mission planning segment of the Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) that provides subsystems for the precision targeting, route planning, mission distribution, and strike management of Tomahawk cruise missile missions from sites located ashore and afloat. TMPC optimizes all aspects of the Tomahawk missile mission to successfully engage a target.  TMPC has evolved into 4 scalable configurations deployed at 189 sites: Cruise Missile Support Activities (CMSAs) (3), Tomahawk Strike Mission Planning Cells (TSMPCs) (3), Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) (19 - 10 CVN), and Firing Units (FRUs) (145 - 88 Surface \/ 57 Subsurface). Additionally, TMPC is installed in labs (6) and training classrooms (13) that contain various combinations of the four configurations.\n\nContinuous TMPC software updates decreases mission planning time and increases the quality and accuracy of each mission while reducing complexity. TMPC provides mission planning at the theater and operational levels and is designed for high rate mission planning production responsive to national strategic, operational, and tactical requirements. TMPC produces and distributes missions; provides command information services; provides strike planning, execution, coordination, control and reporting, and provides Maritime Component Commanders (MCC) the capability to plan or modify conventional TWS missions.  TMPC supports major joint combat operations and Overseas Contingency Operations. TMPC was previously referred to as Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S).\n\nFunds provide for systems engineering, testing, Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V), security accreditation, installation, site acceptance testing, user familiarization of products, and hardware. Also, this funding line provides for COTS refreshment, engineering changes, software upgrades, cyber-security modernization, and associated Nuclear Powered General Purpose Attack Submarine\/Guided Missile Destroyer\/Guided Missile Cruiser\/Nuclear Aircraft Carrier (SSNs\/DDGs\/CGs\/CVN) logistics and infrastructure to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing and future TMPC and TTWCS system configurations.\n\nSurface and Submarine Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) is a post milestone III (Milestone C) program executing a technology refresh to support Tomahawk's Block V introduction in FY2021. This refresh resolves processor, display console, equipment rack and software obsolescence issues and ensures required functionality to support modernized capabilities of the weapon system. The updated TTWCS version was released in FY 2017, but hardware and software must be procured and delivered throughout the next several years to promulgate it across the entire fleet, FRUs (145 - 88 Surface \/ 57 Subsurface), labs (6), and initial training classrooms (2). Advanced TTWCS functions include: tasking validation (missile mission matching), planning of over the water routes, initialization, preparation and launch of BLK III\/IV\/V missiles, TTWCS reduced response time and increased operational flexibility through addition of Launch Platform Mission Planning (LPMP), C4I Web services interfaces, and in-flight monitoring and control of Blk IV missiles. In addition, funds provided to continue TTWCS viability in TTWCS v5.6 and ensure compliance with cyber security mandates, continue to address hardware obsolescence through periodic COTS hardware refresh and periodically refresh of GOTS software to address obsolescence, support migration from 32 bit to 64 bit architecture and migrate away from obsolete or unsupportable software.  Finally, this tech refresh will allow reduction of system complexity and incorporation of critical software fixes.  Program options are being identified that will increase TWS capabilities integrated into future platforms (DDG-1000, LUSV). Development of TTWCS configuration management changes to comply with the provisions of section 1634 of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act was completed in FY 2019; kit deployment continues into FY 2020 and beyond.  These efforts to bring TTWCS into compliance with the provisions of section 1634 of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act introduced unplanned cost and developmental schedule delays to the integration of new capabilities into the Tomahawk Weapons System."

            "val": "This line funds TTWCS and TMPC system modernization upgrades.\n\nTTWCS: FY 2021 funding is required to continue fielding TTWCS hardware\/software obsolescence updates. Funds also provide for integration, modernization and interoperability efforts necessary to keep pace with changes, retain capability and exploit capabilities of internal products (TWS All-Up-Round missile and TTWCS) and external products (Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) products, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Integrated Backbone (DIB) compliance, Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) imagery formats and Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) interfaces, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), Global Information Grid\/Internet Protocol (GIG\/IP) (V)6, FORCEnet compliance systems\/interfaces).  These efforts ensure the continued effectiveness of the TWS, including interoperability with TMPC deployed configurations.  Funding supporting TTWCS is appropriately phased to complete the tech refresh in conjunction with the fielding of the Block V Tomahawk in FY 2021, relies on COTS hardware that requires a stable and established upgrade path to meet cyber security mandates, ensures continued vendor supportability, avoids costly retrofits of fielded systems, and ensures interoperability between tightly coupled COTS software applications, operating systems, and hardware processing nodes.  Consequently, increased product improvement resources are required to comply with commercial hardware\/software supportability mandates, obsolescence, and information assurance requirements to maintain pace with modern computing architectures.  Funding that was reflected in FY 2020 under cost code 2.1.2, SubUUV Transition, in FY 2021 through FY2023 was realigned to a more appropriate budget line for execution.\n\nTMPC: FY 2021 funding is required to continue the upgrade of unsupportable and obsolete TMPC hardware and software, ensure compliance with DoD cyber-security mandates, continues fielding of TMPC 5.0.2 onboard Firing Units (DDGs\/CGs), commence fielding of TMPC 6.0 to 189 sites, and restore TMPC 7.0 (Maritime Strike Tomahawk) software and integration modernization efforts to previous levels in order to deploy Maritime Strike Tomahawk. Funding increase in FY 2021 supports TMPC 7.0 cyber protection (including virtualization) and modernization efforts essential to addressing approximately 400 requirements for cyber resilience of the TMPC system (classified as having a high Mission Assurance Category for cyber Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).  Funding increase also provides for the completion of a unique hardware buy required to support program protection for the Tomahawk Planning System (TPS) component of the TMPC in order to protect Critical Program Information.  Integration of this critical program protection technology will occur in FY 2021 - FY 2024, and will permit implementation of advanced capabilities of the Tomahawk Modernization program with needed program protection safeguards."

In addition, modification kits, upgrades, engineering and program support services for maintenance and configuration management. \n\nThe Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire\/Wireless-guided (TOW) missiles (BGM-71 Series) are combat proven missiles that provide heavy anti-armor\/assault capability to the USMC Infantry, Tank, and Light Armored Vehicle Battalions. TOW continues to be used consistently in Operation Freedom Sentinel (OFS) as the weapon of choice in precision combat engagements. Marines employ TOW missiles against buildings and field fortifications taking advantage of the missile's inherent precision assault capability against such targets. The TOW missiles are launched from a variety of combat systems such as High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle, and Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), as well as ground mounted. The TOW missile provides the warfighter with a highly lethal, cost effective, interoperable, multi-purpose weapon.  Product improvement upgrades will be performed to the TOW missile launcher system and its components.\n\nFunding for Modification Kits moves to BLI 3017 beginning in FY 2017."

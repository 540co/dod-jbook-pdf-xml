            "val": "- The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense (AMD) supports the Field Surveillance Program (FSP), PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC), International Engineering Services Program (IESP), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), US Unique Engineering Services (ES), and System Engineering Program Management (SEPM) activities. The mission of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Field Surveillance Program (FSP) is required to ensure that the reliability, performance, and safety of fielded PAC-3 missiles remain within the classified system specification for the life of the system.  Initial FSP tasks confirm the quality of design, materials, procedures, and processes used in the manufacture of the system.  After missile deployment, results from surveillance firings, inspections, functional tests, Storage and Aging Programs, and depot level missile maintenance processing provide the data required for the assessment of reliability, performance, and safety of the missile stockpile. This includes PAC-3 missile tooling and test equipment. The PAC-3 missile is fielded under the Certified Round Concept.  Under this approved concept, the PAC-3 missile is capable of being placed in extended storage as part of war reserve stocks or deployed in operational units for variable periods and then fired without intervening tests or checkouts.  In accordance with the Certified Round Concept, the reliability\/performance of the missile is certified by the Lower Tier Project Office (LTPO) to be at an acceptable level for a stated period of time or corrective action is taken.\n - The certification of reliability is made possible through the use of the PAC-3 Missile Support Center (P3MSC) contract to use technical support and knowledge of the testing of discrete lots of component parts, subassemblies and assemblies which the prime contractor Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) provides as the only source of technical knowledge, expertise, and facilities to perform FSP activities and process PAC-3 missiles.\n - The PATRIOT International Engineering Services Program provides continuing engineering support for system software and hardware for the life of the PATRIOT Air Defense System for US and international partners. The Engineering Services Program is designed to sustain, maintain, and improve the PATRIOT system within the performance envelope described in the system specification. The support provided under this program includes PATRIOT software maintenance, Post Deployment Build 8\/8.x(PDB-8\/8.x), engineering support for PATRIOT peculiar hardware, government furnished equipment, logistics, technical data package, trainers, US Unique ES, and integrated diagnostics support system. This is accomplished through the investigation, analysis, and development of solutions to identified problems. Modifications to hardware are engineered for manufacturing implementation and retrofit of fielded hardware through the modification process. The Dismounted Patriot Information Coordination Central (D-PICC) effort is an example of rehosting tactical Patriot software maintained via engineering services to a smaller, more mobile hardware configuration that will allow flexible, tailorable deployment options by freeing up Battalion level ICC's.\n - Systems Engineering and Project Management support encompasses the overall planning, management, and control of the PATRIOT Weapon System.  Includes all Engineering and Program Management disciplines and activities.  Program office core employee labor costs moved from Procurement (or RDTE) to OMA as part of an OSD auditability directive. \n - Logistics Recurring includes all aspects of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) management, e.g., maintenance support, facilities, personnel, training, testing, and fielding.\n - Funding is in support of procuring, fielding, and supporting materiel solutions to counter cybersecurity and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space."

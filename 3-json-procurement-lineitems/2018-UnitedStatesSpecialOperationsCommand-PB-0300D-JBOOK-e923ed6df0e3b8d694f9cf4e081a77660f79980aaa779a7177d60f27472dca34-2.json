Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) provides organic aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) for world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts.  ARSOA utilizes 72 highly specialized MH-60 aircraft capable of world-wide rapid deployment operations and penetration of hostile areas for these missions.  The aircraft are capable of operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions and harsh environments deep in enemy territory.  The aircraft are used to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, provide close air support, and extract SOF.  The MH-60M program provides ARSOA with a single model aircraft prepared to support the SOF ground force commander into the foreseeable future."

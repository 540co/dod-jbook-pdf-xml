            "val": "Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS):\n\nMNIS is a portfolio of three coalition information sharing capabilities (Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System (CENTRIXS), Pegasus, and the Combined Federated Battle Laboratory Network (CFBLNet) designed to enable and improve sharing of operational and intelligence among United States (US) forces and multinational partners.  This program directly supports five combatant commands and is critical because US forces no longer fight and win independently but rely on close coordination and collaboration with allies and other mission partners.  MNIS increases overall combat effectiveness by leveraging capabilities and information from all partners and reducing the possibility of fratricide. \n \n\u2022 CENTRIXS consists of multiple, isolated Communities of Interest (COI) that support multinational efforts including Overseas Contingency Operations and counter-narcotics operations.  Common Mission Network Transport (CMNT) provides the backbone that enables Network Operations (NETOPS) centers to manage individual networks more efficiently.  CMNT provides a common transport for encrypted traffic to meet mission partner communication requirements and facilitate the movement of Virtual Private Network traffic between segments.  This capability supports Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 8110.1 guidance to integrate CENTRIXS and other operational networks into existing DoD general service communications infrastructure as a separate network servicing all DoD MNIS requirements.\n\n\u2022 Pegasus interconnects the National Command and Control (C2) systems of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States using Cross Domain Solutions to enable information sharing in facilitating situational awareness and strategic planning as well as operational execution. \n  \n\u2022 CFBLNet provides a controlled Research, Development, Trials and Assessment coalition information sharing sandbox is used to evaluate new technologies and to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures that facilitate the transition of promising technologies and capabilities into operational multinational information sharing capability enhancements.\n\nFY 2017: ($0.623) Procured NSA encryptor hardware to support classified networks on two Service Delivery Node (SDN) locations.  \n\nFY 2018: ($0.708)  Will perform technical refresh of NSA cryptographic equipment at two coalition node locations that support cryptographically isolated network data traffic for Coalition Allies and Mission Partners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExplanation of Change from FY 2017 to FY 2018: The increase  of +$0.085 between FY 2017 and FY 2018 is to support additional cryptographic COMSEC hardware devices from NSA that support coalition information sharing at infrastructure node locations \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFY 2019: ($0.000)  \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nExplanation of Change from FY 2018 to FY 2019: The decrease of -$0.708 between FY 2018 and FY 2019 is due to the functional transfer of the MNIS program to the Air Force beginning in FY 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPerformance Metrics:  \n\n-  System provides 99.99% data integrity for authorized users sharing information cross COI.                 \nFY17 (Planned): N\/A\n\n-  Maintain 99.99% Confidentiality for users, by Nation between COIs.                                         \nFY17 (Estimated): N\/A\n\n-  Direct traffic with 99.99% accuracy for chat, email, VoIP, file transfer, data storage and web service.\nFY17 (Estimated): N\/A\n  \nPerformance Metric:   \n-  Deny 98.5% of unauthorized user attempts                                                                 \nFY17 (Estimated): N\/A\n\nPerformance Metric:   \n-  Audit log captured 99.99% of any unauthorized user activity                                                 \nFY17 (Estimated): N\/A\n   \nPerformance Metric: \n- 2 sites receiving cryptographic tech refresh and\/or hardware replaced prior to End of Life (EOL) per FY.\n                                            \nFY17: 2 Planned \/ 2 Actual\nFY18: 2 Planned\n   \nWhite House Situation Support Staff (WHSSS):  \n \nWHSSS provides classified communications, computer, and intelligence for the White House Situation Room, the National Security Staff, and other White House offices.

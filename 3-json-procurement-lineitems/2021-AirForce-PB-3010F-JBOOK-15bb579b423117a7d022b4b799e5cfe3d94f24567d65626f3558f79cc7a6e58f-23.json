            "val": "1.) The Engine Depot Stock & Preservation Kit buy provides investment-funded engine depot replenishment spares to support depot operations during the transition from the Maintenance Service Rate Plan (MSRP)\/Globemaster Integrated Sustainment Program (GISP) overhaul construct to the Engine Sustainment Services (ESS)\/GISP overhaul construct. This follows a Secretary of the Air Force (Sec AF) directive to procure engine sustainment outside of the GISP Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.  \n\n2.) Purchase of Peculiar and Common Support Equipment for the C-17 (PSE and CSE). CSE is comprised of support equipment used by the C-17 and other programs, while PSE is unique to the C-17. Both are required to effectively operate the Organizational and Intermediate (O&I) levels of aircraft maintenance at Main Operating Bases (MOBs), Avionics Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), Engine RMCs, Enroute locations, Backshop activities, plus requirements in support of the Boeing Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) and WR (Warner Robins)-ACI Global Reach Improvement Program (GRIP) contracts.\n\n3.) The Post Production Product Improvement (PPPI) program funds Materiel Improvement Program (MIP) projects. MIP projects correct Deficiency Report (DR) issues that were discovered during the aircraft production phase. There have been over 275 projects incorporated into production aircraft. About 35 projects remain to be retrofitted to post production aircraft to bring them up to production aircraft configuration. The projects are worked in conjunction with aircraft heavy maintenance (depot) cycle every 6 years. \n\n4.) C-17 Weapon System Trainer (WST)- The purpose of this effort is to procure and install two (2)Weapon System Trainers (WST)s. The WSTs are simulators which support C-17 continuation training, in-unit upgrades, in-unit requalification, initial and refresher maintenance engine run qualifications, and new full spectrum readiness requirements to include chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological training and mission employment scenario training. The effort also includes site preparation and activation of C-17 training systems sites.\n\nFunding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues. Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 0401130F and 0401897F."

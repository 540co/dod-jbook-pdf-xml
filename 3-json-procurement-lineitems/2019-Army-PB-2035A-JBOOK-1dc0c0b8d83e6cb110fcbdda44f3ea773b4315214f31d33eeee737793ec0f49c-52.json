These integrated automated translation capabilities will be applicable across three different system configurations; a hand-held\/wearable portable device, a laptop\/mobile device, and in a networked\/web-enabled system. The software modules will translate English from a prioritized list of languages in a prioritized collection of domains (e.g. medical, intelligence, base security). MFLTS is interoperable with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) automation equipment to include the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) and Nett Warrior, and will be interoperable with a future version of the CI\/HUMINT Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS)."

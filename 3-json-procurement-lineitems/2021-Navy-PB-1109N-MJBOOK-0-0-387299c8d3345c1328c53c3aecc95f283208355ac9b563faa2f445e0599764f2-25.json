        "Description": {
            "val": "Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is a Department of the Navy (DON) enterprise program (ACAT IAC) which provides secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel. NGEN forms the foundation for the DON's future Naval Networking Environment (NNE), is interoperable with and leverages other DOD provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services and supports the Joint Information Environment (JIE). For the Marine Corps, NGEN is a Government Owned\/Government Operated (GO\/GO) model augmented by NGEN contractors with the garrison Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) representing the NGEN Marine Corps management domain. NGEN (USMC) supports the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) using a regionalized model, executed through Marine Forces Cyberspace Command, Marine Corps Cyberspace Operations Group (formerly Marine Corps Network Operations and Support Center (MCNOSC) and MAGTF IT Support Centers (MITSCs).  The NGEN (USMC) program provides contractor support for the operation and support of the MCEN Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (MCEN-N) to include multiple contracts that provide equipment refresh.   The program also supports hardware\/software license and warranty generating lifecycle services ultimately enabling Cyber\/Information Technology (CYBER\/IT) capabilities for the Marine Corps in accordance with the NGEN Acquisition Strategy. These capabilities include enterprise infrastructure, end-user workstations, service desk, and network operations centers at Marine Corps base\/post\/stations and regional installation commands CONUS and OCONUS (Hawaii, Japan, Germany, and Korea).  \n\nNGEN will deliver an end-to-end hosting solution to consolidate and replace End-Of-Life (EOL) hardware\/software (HW\/SW) and infrastructure that currently provides enterprise network services (email, file storage, security services, identity management, etc.) to MCEN-N users (CONUS and OCONUS).  It also provides High Availability\/Disaster Recovery (HA\/DR) capabilities that are not currently available in support of USMC Continuity of Operations (COOP) requirements. The requirement also includes the delivery of a Wide Area Network (WAN) transport solution based upon the JIE and Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) construct to consolidate and replace EOL HW\/SW that currently provides enterprise network WAN transport services to MCEN-N users.  As the consolidated, upgraded solution is developed, the program will continue to tech refresh end user devices, servers, routers, switches, network storage, software, initial equipment warranties, and defensive cyberspace capabilities (intrusion prevention systems, firewalls, etc.).  The hardware and software for this refresh differs in quantities and costs based on varying requirements including the current pricing.  The quantities that are ordered are based on hardware\/software end of service\/life limitations and the operational balance between security and risk management. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, functional testing, and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities in conjunction with newer technology insertion to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement.\n\nNetwork Access Control Compliance and Remediation (NACCR) is an Abbreviated Acquisition Program (AAP) modification to the NGEN and Secure Operational Network Infrastructure Capability (SONIC) Programs of Record (PORs) supporting the network access control concept on the MCEN. The NACCR end state solution provides an integrated capability allowing only authorized and compliant assets connection to the garrison enterprise network.  This solution utilizes 802.1X and Active Directory authentication protocols, as well as a series of compliance checks to ensure that critical software patches, anti-virus\/anti-malware definitions and other established compliance criteria are current for assets on the network.  It also generates trouble tickets as required and reports compliance standards. Any asset found to be non-compliant with the established criteria will be forced into a partially isolated network segment, where required remediation corrective actions will be taken. Should the automated remediation efforts prove unsuccessful after the prescribed number of attempts, the asset will be forced into a completely isolated network segment until it can be manually brought into compliance.\n\nComply to Connect (C2C) is an AAP modification to the NGEN and SONIC PORs supporting Network Access Control (NAC) on the MCEN and associated Marine Corps domains. C2C is an expansion of the existing NACCR AAP to include all\ntypes of devices operating on all Marine Corps networks. The C2C end state solution provides an integrated capability allowing only authorized and compliant assets connection to the garrison enterprise network. This\nsolution utilizes 802.1X and Active Directory authentication protocols, as well as a series of automated compliance checks to ensure that critical software patches, anti-virus\/anti-malware definitions and other established\ncompliance criteria are current for assets on the network.  It also automatically generates trouble tickets and reports compliance standards. Any asset found to be non-compliant with the established criteria may be partially or completely isolated from the network, while required remediation\/corrective actions will be taken. Should the automated\nremediation efforts prove unsuccessful after the prescribed number of attempts, the asset will be forced into a completely isolated network segment until it can be manually brought into compliance."

            "val": "FY 2019: $116.120M ensures the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the MCEN against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.  Funding procures services, hardware and software supporting end user devices, and network infrastructure technical refresh.  Tech refresh supports the MCEN Unification Campaign Plan, Cyberspace Operations requirements, and the Marine Corps' implementation of the JIE which includes Enterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) critical design and site configuration. Tech Refresh includes the design, configuration, and functional testing and integration of commercial or non-developmental network solutions to resolve and mitigate network security vulnerabilities.  This is in conjunction with the insertion of newer technology to improve reliability, improve maintainability, reduce cost, and\/or add minor performance enhancement. In addition, FY 2019 efforts include the continuation of WLAN implementation which will increase the operational readiness of operating forces and decrease maintenance time by allowing the maintainers to connect to technical manuals and maintenance systems while they are working. Currently maintainers must leave their work and go to a kiosk where there is a wired connection.\n\nCost Elements in FY 2019 were updated to reflect actuals. Comply to Connect (C2C) Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) for $34M was added.  \n\nFY 2020: $95.726M will ensure the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the MCEN against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities.  Overall, FY 2020 funding decreased $20.394M from FY 2019 due to the additional funding provided to the program in FY 2019 as part of the Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) for Comply to Connect (C2C).  The baseline appropriations request also includes $78K which is needed to procure End User Devices in support of MCB Guam personnel.  \n\nFielding Support (Cost Element 1.1.2) $2.831M funding in this cost element provided fielding support for Network Equipment which was procured in FY 2020.  This cost element is directly related to changes in cost elements 1.1.1 and 1.1.3.\n\nNetwork Equipment Tech Refresh (Cost Element 1.1.3) $49.164M.  Funding in this cost element procured equipment which supported the Marine Corps' Assured Command and Control Strategy which focuses on transforming and optimizing the non-Classified side of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network and directly supports DoD's Comply To Connect (C2C) initiative through network modernization.  Upgrades include the procurement of 802.1X access switches enabling the Network Access Control portion of the C2C requirement found in Section 1653 of the FY 2017 NDAA.  Additionally, the equipment procured under this cost element will be replacing equipment that is no longer receiving security patches or updates from the vendor and is therefore more vulnerable to hostile actors and other cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a cybersecurity precaution and this will lead to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  The increase will enable the Marine Corps to replace the aging network devices with current cybersecurity standard compliant devices which will enable users across the Marine Corps to continue to operate without network disruptions.  \n\nEnterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) (Cost Element 1.1.4) 27.842M,  Funding under this cost element provides for the upgrading and modernizing the Enterprise Service Stacks (ESS), Installation Processing Nodes (IPN), Installation Service Node (ISN) and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) across the non-Classified side of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network.  These modernizations will support the Marine Corps' ability to migrate to the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the cloud by increasing bandwidth which will enable individual and organizational mobility and supports the rapid deployment of mission critical applications and services.  In addition, the migration to the cloud will result in reducing long network engineering\/provision lead times.\n\nWireless Local Area Network (WLAN) (Cost Element 1.1.5) $14.410M, Funding in this cost element provides for the completion of the WLAN project at the initial maintenance bays and hangars installations.  This effort will enable maintainers to access updated technical manual messages and updated maintenance information\/alerts.  The implementation of WLAN at maintenance bays and hangars, resulted in a 25% increase to the number of Ready Basic Aircraft due to efficiencies generated from WLAN. \n\nNetwork Access Control Compliance and Remediation (NACCR) (Cost Element 1.2.1) $0.678M funding in this cost element provided for the completion of the initial NACCR procurement.\n\nDisaster Recovery (Cost Element 1.2.3) $0.723M funding in this cost element supports the initial phase of the procurement of replacement equipment for damaged equipment during natural disasters aboard Marine Corps Installations.\n\nDefense Policy Review Initiative (Cost Element 1.1.6) $0.078M\n\nFY 2021 Baseline Appropriation Request: $78.922M will ensure the Marine Corps is defending and protecting the MCEN against cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities while also providing a robust, modern communications infrastructure.  The decrease in FY21 is principally due to significantly reduced buy of network infrastructure following significant investment in FY20.  The decrease in FY21 reduces the investment in network infrastructure due to higher Service priorities.  Additionally, the baseline appropriations request decreased due to the completion of the current Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) requirement in FY 2020, and deferred the remaining WLAN requirements to future budget years.  \n\nEnd User Device (Cost Element 1.1.1) funding increased from $0.00M in FY 2020 to $16.285M in FY 2021, a $16.285M increase to re-establish a hardware refresh timeline consistent with previous funding levels.  Funding in this cost element provides for the refresh\/replacement of End User Devices (EUDs) enables Replacing the aging EUDs reduces vulnerable equipment on the MCEN, reducing cyber security risks to the Marine Corps network. \n\nFielding Support (Cost Element 1.1.2) funding decreased from $2.831M in FY 2020 to $2.329M in FY 2021, a $0.502M decrease due to the reduction in equipment being fielded in FY21.  This cost element is directly related to changes in cost elements 1.1.1 and 1.1.3.\n\nNetwork Equipment Tech Refresh (Cost Element 1.1.3) funding decreased from $49.164M in FY20 to $29.420M in FY 2021, a $19.744M decrease to funding for aging infrastructure and buy-dwon of technical debt.  Funding in this cost element provides modern, cybersecurity compliant replacement equipment for vulnerable, aging infrastructure which poses cyber security risks to the MCEN.  If not replaced, these aging network devices will be removed from the network as a cybersecurity precaution which leads to Marine Corps users being unable to connect to the MCEN.  \n\nEnterprise Infrastructure Modernization (EIM) (Cost Element 1.1.4) funding increased from $27.842M in FY 2020 to $30.859M in FY 2021, a $3.017M increase due to the planned modernization schedule.  Funding under this cost element provides for modernization of the Enterprise Service Stacks (ESS), Installation Processing Nodes (IPNs), Installation Service Nodes (ISNs), and Geographically Separated Units (GSU) across the non-Classified side of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network.  These modernizations enable the Marine Corps' ability to migrate to the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the cloud by increasing reliability, bandwidth, and responsiveness.\n\nWireless Local Area Network (WLAN) (Cost Element 1.1.5) funding decreased from $14.410M in FY 2020 to $0M in FY 2021, a $14.410M decrease, due to the completion of the initial procurement of WLAN capabilities for the maintenance bays and stations.  Remaining WLAN requirements have been deferred to future budget years due to higher Service priorities.  \n\nNetwork Access Control Compliance and Remediation (Cost Element 1.2.1) funding decreased from $0.678M in FY 2020 to $0.000M in FY 2021, a $0.678M decrease due to the completion of initial fielding of the discovery tool for identifying the physical devices on the network.\n\nDisaster Recovery (Cost Element 1.2.3) funding decreased from $0.723M in FY 2020 to $0.000M in FY 2021, due to the completion of the initial procurement replacement equipment related to natural disasters on Marine Corps' Installations."

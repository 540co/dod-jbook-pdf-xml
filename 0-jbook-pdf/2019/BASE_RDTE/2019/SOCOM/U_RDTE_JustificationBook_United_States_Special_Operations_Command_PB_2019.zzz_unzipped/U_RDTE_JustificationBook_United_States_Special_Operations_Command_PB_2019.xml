            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate commercial/government off-the-shelf systems, and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which resides within the SOF Information Enterprise and enables more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition tactical ISR PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) - peculiar mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Ground Control Stations (GCSs), and training systems as a component of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical program.  USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small businesses with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 was the first year USSOCOM participated in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small businesses with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SBIR is a three-phase program that provides early-stage Research and Development (R&amp;D) to small companies. Eligible projects must fulfill an R&amp;D need identified by DOD and have the potential to be developed into a product or service for commercial or defense markets. SBIR is designed to stimulate technological innovation, increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D, increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D and foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H/W/U and MC-130E/H/P, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking; near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  

SF200 CV-22 Development/Test and Evaluation:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA radar best known as Silent Knight Radar (SKR) or APQ-187, provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.  There is a plan to develop a Defensive Weapon System (DWS) that gives a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress/eliminate enemy targets.  This effort integrates the SOF unique Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) with DWS providing necessary capability improvements identified during operational use and interim contract support.

S750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

S875 AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.

D615 Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and improve aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:

FY 2017:  Net decrease of -$7.489 million is due to a transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs (-$5.928 million), a congressional reduction for prior year carryover for SOMPE (-$0.890 million), and a decrease for higher command priorities (-$0.671 million).

FY 2018:  None.

FY 2019:  Net increase of $7.387 million is for completion of Phase III integration, testing, and Air Worthiness Release (AWR) for the A/MH-6 Block 3.0 Upgrade ($3.120 million); to complete development and testing of trial kit installation of EC-130J Block Upgrade ($1.263 million); testing of flares and chaff to address emerging threats for RW ASE Upgrades ($4.192 million); flight qualification and AWR testing of the Degraded Visual Environment solution ($3.222 million); continues PSP High Energy Laser (HEL) development of system architecture, acquire beam director subsystem and laser subsystem, interface control documentation, and completes risk reduction for AC-130J aircraft ($30.020 million); continues integration/testing of CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar ($0.898 million); higher command priorities (-$4.024 million); a Departmental economic assumption adjustment (-$1.482 million); and the FY 2019 funding request was reduced by -$29.822 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Schedule: Silent Knight Radar (SKR):  Hardware failures with first 3 LRIP IIA radars delivered delayed Regression Testing and have delayed Initial Operational Test for the MH-60/MH-47 into 4th Quarter FY 2018.  EC-130J SOF-Unique 7.0/8.1 development delay was due to a delay in the 7.0/8.1 Air Force modification contract.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO:  Digital broadcast capabilities are being developed through an incremental acquisition strategy to incorporate and test readily available equipment into the EC-130J aircraft.

• EW – RFCM:  Awarded competitive EMD contract for development. Down selected to the best overall solution to integrate and test an RFCM System on AC/MC-130J aircraft.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division as the government Lead System Integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium broad area announcement using incremental Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts and cost sharing agreements.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls. Government developmental test and evaluation, FY 2018 - FY 2020; Operational Test and Evaluation, FY 2021; Required Assets Available, Q1FY2022.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Competitive EMD contract was awarded to Raytheon in FY 2007 for radar B Kit design, development, and testing.  Subsequent MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit design, integration, and test efforts awarded to Lockheed Martin (SOFSA). Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) awarded to Raytheon in January 2017 for software development of Software Version (SW ver) 7.14 (outcome of 2017 Limited Users Test).  Continued software development to enhance interoperability with other on aircraft systems in FY18/19 followed by operational capability additions and move to sensor fusion TF FY20-24.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this program supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.

Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. 

CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar: Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable radar to replace obsolescing and APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational beyond FY 2020 and until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA) rotary wing aircraft.  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System.  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit: (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-unique aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced Surface-to-Air threat systems for the A/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter measure system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements (P3I)/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.  P3I upgrades may include, but are not limited to, expansion of frequency ranges on existing systems, modernization of legacy components, and studies directed at potential "collaborative off-boarding/on-boarding" detect/countermeasure capabilities to provide expanded coverage for aircrews in a high threat environment.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises of two distinct efforts:  airframe and avionics upgrades.  Additionally within the airframe upgrade, there are two sub efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new integrated airframe shells).  The airframe efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-unique upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing OEMs, while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.

•  The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.

•  The SRTV project integrates and tests software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time FMV intelligence.  A variety of contracting methods will be used for acquiring test assets, accomplishing SOF-unique modifications and testing to include use of other services’ contracts, competition, sole source awards, and directed efforts of government organizations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, biometric/forensic site exploitation and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This program provides research and development and rapid prototyping as the HQ SOCOM Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  NSSS introduces and integrates national systems capabilities into the SOF force structure and operations.  This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.

•  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Special Operation Forces (SOF) must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals. 

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for the development, testing, integration, and evaluation of specialized equipment, to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF in varied missions; counter-improvised explosive device systems, to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats; and signature reducing materials and technologies, to reduce the probability of detection by battlefield threat sensors.

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seeker, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software and missile delivery to meet SOF requirements.  Provides for testing and integration of Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition Systems (LMAMS) onto SOF-unique platforms to meet the operational needs of the SOF operator in high threat environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4 systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>BFT is a family of devices used to remotely track and monitor Blue forces. The capability enhances C2, threat warning, force protection, situational awareness, combat search and rescue, counter-fratricide, and battlefield visualization. This capability is unique to SOF because it requires the devices to be lightweight, portable, secure and a Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) includes the consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies (previously Program Element (PE) 0304210BB); MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), (previously PE 0305219BB); MQ-8, (previously PE 0305231BB); RQ-11, UAV (previously PE 1105232BB); and RQ-7 UAV, (previously PE 1105233BB).

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Unmanned ISR develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of ISR and Targeting capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2019:  Net decrease of $0.790 million is an increase that continues evaluation of unique sensor technologies, persistent stare, and quick reaction systems ($3.219 million); a decrease due to a Departmental economic assumption adjustment (-$0.263 million); and the FY2019 funding request was reduced by -$3.746 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

FY 2019 OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.  Increase of $11.700 million is for advanced payload development; development and integration of Beyond Line of Sight wiring harnesses required to operate SOF-unique sensors, VORTEX encrypted data link capability, and Persistent Close Air Support collaborative engagement management capabilities on the SOF Gray Eagle Extended Range UAS.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. This program also provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SAFC acquisition strategy is evolutionary and spiral-based for technology insertion and low volume procurement.  Utilizes existing competed contract vehicles to the maximum extent possible for minor development and integration and modification of Government-Off-The-Shelf/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment. It utilizes limited/full and open competition contracts for major developments. 

The Group 1 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Group 2 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the OEM.

Group 3 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the OEM.Group 4 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades. Contract types include a mix of cost type and fixed priced.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary issues with aircraft and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor Operational Flight Program (OFP) software and aircraft modification considerations dictate sole source contracts.  

Group 4 UAS leverages service common Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contracts for aircraft and ancillary equipment sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM was a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from United States Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  SEALION III is Sole Source to the OEM in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.  

•  CCME emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by employing the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies to include the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L Science &amp; Technology Directorate. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, finally transitioning to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.

•  CCA utilizes various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft’s current performance envelope.

•  TAS PM JTWS will perform market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition.  PM JTWS is planning a developmental effort in FY18/FY19 to mature existing technologies.  PM-SS will retain funds to support integration across the family of Combatant Craft.

•  MPE will be a full and open competition of the launcher systems with follow-on government-led integration effort leveraging lessons learned from similar rapid integration efforts on other combat tested SOF platforms.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

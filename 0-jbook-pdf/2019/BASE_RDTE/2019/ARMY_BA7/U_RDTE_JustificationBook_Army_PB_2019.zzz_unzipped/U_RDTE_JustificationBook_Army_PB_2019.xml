            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 093.  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers. This project funds software development for the MLRS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

FY2019 Base funding in the amount of $4.947 million for project 093 supports the continued software development of an organic tactical software build in support of the Fire Control System (FCS) hardware supporting both the current MLRS Fleet (upon upgrade with a modern hardware FCS) and the Army's MLRS Fleet Expansion effort. This software development leverages the program's completed software transition from the prime contractor to the government in FY2016. This FCS solution will be ready to field in FY2021. The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and will be the first release of organic software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher in FY2021.

Project 789. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) is the only live training rocket for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and M270/M270A1 MLRS Launcher units/crews. LCRRPR meets a critical validated requirement for Active and National Guard HIMARS and M270A1 launcher units to achieve and maintain combat readiness. HIMARS and M270A1 Battalions are organic and attached to modular Fires Brigades supporting Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Joint Expeditionary Force, and Joint Special Operations Force combatant commanders. The training rocket has an inert payload section and blunt nose for inducing reduced range for use at multiple facilities in the United States and foreign countries. LCRRPRs are manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Camden, Arkansas and Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. LEMC provides an organic dual source.  The LCRRPR is currently produced by reusing the M26 pod and rocket motor, however, the US Government will soon experience inventory depletion of M26 rocket motors and Launch Pod Containers that feed the LCRRPR production line.

Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

FY2019 Base funding in the amount of $3.939 million for project DX8 supports HIMARS-unique software build, version 8.2. The Product Manager will field this software to the M142 fleet in FY2019. In addition to addressing software maintenance, software version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MLRS Product Improvement Program performs development efforts required to address emerging requirements.   The Army completed transition from the prime contractor (legacy v7.x) to an organic (government developed, maintained, and owned) approach (v8.x forward)) by utilizing the Aviation &amp; Missile Research &amp; Development Engineering Center's (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) as the software developer and maintainer. These efforts are funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  Emerging requirements include updates to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DX8.  The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full spectrum, combat proven, all weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system.  HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires.  HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).  These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges up to 300 kilometers.  This project funds software development for the HIMARS launcher.  The government assumed responsibility for software development and maintenance from the prime contractor in FY2016.  Organic software is defined as government developed, maintained, and owned software.  The long-term end state is a convergence of tactical software across the HIMARS and MLRS launcher platforms into a single product supporting both systems.

FY2019 Base funding in the amount of $3.939 for project DX8 supports development of HIMARS-unique software build, version 8.2. In addition to addressing software maintenance, software version 8.2 enables portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) tracked launcher upon receipt of a hardware Fire Control System upgrade.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HIMARS Product Improvement Program performs development efforts required to address emerging requirements. The Army completed transition from the prime contractor (legacy v7.x) to an organic approach organic (government developed, maintained, and owned) approach (v8.x forward)) by utilizing the Aviation &amp; Missile Research &amp; Development Engineering Center's (AMRDEC) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) as both the software developer and maintainer. These efforts are funded via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR).  Emerging requirements include updates to address emerging threats of the launcher organic version 8.x software, reacting to system changes driven by policy and emerging requirements, and maintaining architectural compatibility. Communication suite changes, munitions updates, and introduction of new munitions require software and/or hardware updates to ensure full compatibility and maintain operational viability.  The enduring organic version 8 software effort is projected for Materiel Release and fielding to HIMARS fleet in FY2019. When fielded, Version 8.2 will enable portability to the M270A2 (MLRS) launcher when upgraded with the Common Fire Control System solution.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL8, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber, will transition to PE 0607131, Project ER6, Direct Fire Technology.  This project is not a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project ER2: The Close Combat Technology program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, countermeasure flares, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.

FY 2019 funds resource improvements to the following programs: MK3A2 Offensive Hand Grenade, AN-M82A1 Obscuration Grenade, M82 Simulant Smoke Practice Grenade Improved Propellant Retainer, and M84 Stun Grenade Design.
 
Project ER5: The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production. Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.

This supports the identification, study, analysis, and development of fuzing technologies and Safe &amp; Arm (S&amp;A) devices in production and in the field.  This project will implement technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce costs by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.

FY 2019 will support modeling and simulation on medium caliber S&amp;A modifications, will evaluate medium caliber prototype modifications against performance requirements, will conduct studies on mortar fuze design architecture with the latest Fuze safety guidelines to preclude component obsolescence, will conduct studies on hand grenade fuze to reduce the number of critical defects that will improve producibility and increase safety, will conduct engineering tests to prove-out electronic transceiver replacement prototypes for indirect fire and direct fire proximity fuzes, will conduct studies on artillery fuze electronic safe and arm designs for low cost safe and arm performance enhancements, and will evaluate optimized impact switch prototypes.

Project ER6: The Direct Fire Technology funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. FY 2019 funds are used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. Warhead improvement and primer improvement for the 30mm Apache ammunition are also under development. A number of studies on potential improvements for training ammunition and environmentally friendly primers will be conducted. Potential improvements to 105mm and 120mm ammunition will be examined.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Use of the AN-M8 Obscuration Grenade has been discontinued inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) due to restrictions on the use of Hexachloroethane on the battlefield.  The M83 training smoke grenade is currently used in lieu of the AN-M8 in both training and tactical operations.  However, since the M83 does not give screening performance comparable to the legacy AN-M8 grenade, the current warfighter strategy is to use two M83 Obscuration Grenades in lieu of a single AN-M8.</r2:Description>

The strategy for the AN-M8A1 is to develop a safer smoke for use by the soldiers that meet the existing requirements.  Once the smoke fill is developed and qualified, the plan is to examine the potential use of adding this capability to Pine Bluff Arsenal.  
The strategy for the M84 Stun Grenade is to complete the development of the technical date package and test/qualify the design prior to being used in future competitive pending the results of a market survey.  
The M82 program is updating the design of specific parts to make it more producible and will be proving out the design for use in future production efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production. Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.

This supports the identification, study, analysis, and development of fuzing technologies and Safe &amp; Arm (S&amp;A) devices in production and in the field.  This project will implement technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce costs by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.

FY 2019 will support modeling and simulation on medium caliber S&amp;A modifications, will evaluate medium caliber prototype modifications against performance requirements, will conduct studies on mortar fuze design architecture with the latest Fuze safety guidelines to preclude component obsolescence, will conduct studies on hand grenade fuze to reduce the number of critical defects that will improve producibility and increase safety, will conduct engineering tests to prove-out electronic transceiver replacement prototypes for indirect fire and direct fire proximity fuzes, will conduct studies on artillery fuze electronic safe and arm designs for low cost safe and arm performance enhancements, and will evaluate optimized impact switch prototypes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FTI develops second source suppliers and resolves component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer.  The effort is a continuation of studies, analysis, evaluations, and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field.  This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude component obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The Fuze Technology Integration Program utilizes both the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) initiatives to produce prototypes of the fuze technologies and devices, and FAR-based contracts to implement proven efforts into production fuzes.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) is being developed as a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. LRPF is a major improvement over the current ATACMS with increased range, lethality, loadout, and an open systems architecture. The mission of the LRPF System is to attack/neutralize/suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. LRPF will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. The LRPF will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. LRPF requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds a minimum of two missiles, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). LRPF is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.

FY 2019 base dollars in the amount of $186.475 million support the continuation of LRPF development through the execution of two TMRR competitive prototyping and flight demonstration agreements. FY 2019 funding increase supports integration of test assets for risk reduction activities and allows both contractors to complete their tactical designs through the Critical Design Review (CDR), allows both contractors to conduct component and system level Engineering Development Test (EDT) qualification activities, conduct critical missile survivability assessments and ensures risk mitigation activities support transition to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). Carrying 2 contractors through CDR prior to down select, will reduce risk and ensure a more mature design. FY 2019 efforts include conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and completion of the final prototype tactical design with an assessment of future growth capabilities. Each contractor will complete final integration of four (4) prototype missiles. The first two prototype flight demonstrations are planned for FY19. Results will provide performance data to inform  the contractor's proposed design.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY 2017 funding reflects an adjustment of $30.684M which includes $27.731M that was requested in the Request for Additional FY17 Appropriations, but Congress did not appropriate the funds, a $1.5M funding decrement and $1.453M allocated against Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR).

FY 2019 funding reflects an increase of $74.970M to support the integration of test assets and continuation of design maturation activities for both vendors through the Critical Design Review (CDR).  The increase in funding will allow both contractors to conduct component and system level Engineering Development Test (EDT) qualification activities, conduct critical missile survivability assessments and ensures risk mitigation activities support transition to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LRPF Acquisition Strategy supports development of a cluster and insensitive munition compliant system that replaces and improves upon ATACMS capabilities while enabling an architecture which facilitates future growth. LRPF provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems.  An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4QFY16, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. 

TMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors will participate in a PDR and build four (4) missile prototypes culminating in flight tests to provide demonstration of their system capabilities. Both contractors will continue risk reduction activities allowing the contractors to mature their tactical designs through the Critical Design Review (CDR), conduct component and system level Engineering Development Test (EDT) qualification activities, conduct critical missile survivability assessments, and ensure risk mitigation activities support transition to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD). Component level testing during TMRR, results of prototype flight tests, and results of EDT flight tests will inform the Source Selection. The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and a Limited User Test (LUT).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request for Apache AH-64E, previously known as Apache Block III, will fund the non-recurring engineering (NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build of 690 Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began in Oct 2011).  The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build.  This project also addresses obsolescence and reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft.  Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability, Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) integration.  Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications.  The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Funds in this program were realigned in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 from Program Element 0203744A Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Projected 504, for more efficient program management.

MEDEVAC:
Incremental RDT&amp;E funding to support integration of a MEDEVAC capability on UH-60V is planned for FY19-22.  In accordance with AR 40-60, Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Army's Aeromedical Evacuation capability is funded by two portfolio managers, PEOAVN and MRMC.  PEOAVN is responsible for the integration of MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package (MEP) on the UH-60V.  MRMC is responsible for recurring costs to procure kits and resource the installation of MEP kits on UH-60V MEDEVAC helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>UH-60V:
The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging. Continuing funding will provide hardware and software development, training material development, as well as developmental and operational testing.

MEDEVAC:
Beginning in FY19, RDT&amp;E funding will support the non-recurring engineering and integration of MEDEVAC MEP into the UH-60V Black Hawk.  The Surgeon General (TSG) has a requirement for a MEDEVAC capability provided by Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but are designated to support the MEDEVAC mission. In accordance with AR 40-60 Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the PEOAVN is responsible for the costs associated with medical MEP integration on Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but require medical MEP modifications/upgrades to support the MEDEVAC mission.  MEDEVAC MEP integration on the UH-60V will address obsolescence and reduce the logistics footprint by increasing equipment commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet and will reduce the number of Black Hawk MEDEVAC configurations.  Additionally, UH-60V MEDEVAC capabilities will increase when comparing MEDEVAC MEP integration on legacy Black Hawk helicopters.  Capability improvements will include simultaneous Rescue Hoist and extended range capability, enabled MEDEVAC Mission Sensor (MMS) use in Arctic conditions, UH-60V Multi-Function Display (MFD) integrated MMS video, and Multi-Function Controller Unit (MFCU) integration of MMS functions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>A05009 UH-60 Blackhawk A and L Models provides procurement funding for conversions to UH-60V starting in FY2018.

MN1000, MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package provides procurement funding for MEDEVAC MEP capability on UH-60 helicopters.  Starting in FY22, MN1000 will resource procurement of MEDEVAC MEP kits and installations at a rate of 15 aircraft per year through FY34 when the AAO of 200 UH-60V MEDEVAC is reached. 

* Figures shown above reflect the full MN1000 - OPA3/MN1000/Combat Support Medical funding line. UH-60V MEDEVAC MEP MN1000 requirements are $5.630 in FY22 and $6.040 in FY23.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The UH-60V program plans to leverage the Prototype Integration Facility (PIF), a Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facility, to design, integrate and build three production representative aircraft. The GOGO facility uses a cost plus contract vehicle and conducted full and open competition for the selection of the avionics solution provider.

The MEDEVAC MEP program plans to utilize the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) to design and integrate MEDEVAC capability into the UH-60V.  By leveraging the same Government Owned/Government Operated (GOGO) facility utilized by the UH-60V program, efficient design, software development, integration, and testing will occur by eliminating redundant tasks and employing experienced government resources already in possession of pertinent UH-60V technical data required to support the MEDEVAC MEP non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort.  Prototype, validation, and verification of technical publications, as well as airworthiness testing will be accomplished following completion of the UH-60V IOT&amp;E, at which time up to two UH-60V EDM aircraft will be allocated to the MEDEVAC MEP program.  Following completion of MEDEVAC MEP NRE, technical products will feed production and fielding contracts, which will be resourced by MEDCOM.  Procurement funding is programmed on MN1000 Combat Support Medical, G13010 MEDEVAC MEP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Block II TFPS is required to safely support initial trainer and operator aircrew training for the Limited User Test (LUT) and beyond.  The TFPS will decrease risk to unit aircrew and trainers by allowing them to train with the new design modifications, handling quality changes and pilot visibility differences versus learning in aircraft.  Training in the TFPS significantly reduces LUT timelines and improves aircrew proficiency as confirmed in the CH-47F (Block I) Phase 2 User Test Report.  Additionally, the initial TFPS serves as a prototype for the remainder of the required TFPS upgrades.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding of the CH-47F Block I in 2007.  The CH-47F Block II will also increase the operational envelope allowing more to be carried at high hot conditions.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Given the need to maintain the Chinook fleet's sustained relevance until replaced, the PM is proposing a block strategy to facilitate incremental upgrades. The Block II program will restore performance lost due to the added weight of safety and survivability equipment incorporated since initial fielding in 2007. Additional objectives of the Block II program include: Efficiently incorporating multiple engineering changes; Accomplishing required mid-life airframe recapitalization; Converging the special operations and conventional Army designs; Establishing a foundation for future block upgrades; and Maintaining the industrial base until Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy is realized.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>For Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and prior, all funding for the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) was contained in Program Element (PE) 0203744A - Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project 504.  FY 2015 funding was initially moved to PE 0203744A, Project EB1.  Prior to execution, FY 2015 and beyond funding was moved to PE 0607139A, Project ES6.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ITEP develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2017 funding continues engine design effort and the platform/engine integration trade studies.  FY 2018 funds the remaining TMRR engine design effort, the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) for entry into Milestone B (MS B), and concludes the platform/engine integration trade studies.  In FY 2019, the EMD contract will be awarded to one vendor, and platform/engine integration design engineering will begin.   FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR) in FY 2020. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, provides for First Engine To Test (FETT), and begins physical airframe integration.  FY 2022 funding will provide Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing, leading to an Air Worthiness Rating (AWR).  FY 2023 funding will provide for aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) has been designated by the Secretary of the Army as the primary system for the accessing, acquiring, and delivery of materiel data. This includes data from all sources designated as Authoritative, as well as, system derived data and appropriate reference data. This data will be used in support of materiel sourcing and distribution and other Materiel Enterprise missions. It enables Command visibility of business intelligence and resulting metrics for critical logistics components enabling enterprise-level analytics to be performed in support of the equipping mission within the Army's Tiered Readiness processes. LOGSA and its LIW suite of products and services provide the Army community with vital logistics data necessary for the planning, conducting and sustainment of war fighting capability worldwide. The LMI-DST directly supports Tiered Readiness by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. Specifically, LMI-DST synchronizes an Army authoritative Demand Signal for manning, equipping, services &amp; infrastructure and authoritative resourcing (money) information, resulting in an
accurate prediction of a ready and properly equipped force. The Army Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss Tracker (AFT) tool is a web-based, automated FLIPL processing and tracking system which provides an electronic FLIPL documentation packet that includes intelligent, digital versions of required forms and allows for attachment of supporting documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool (LMI DST) is a software solution, resident within the Logistics Information Warehouse, that supports the Army Materiel Command in its mission as the Army Lead Materiel Integrator as well as materiel managers at Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Direct Reporting Units, Corps and Divisions with making informed equipping decisions. The LMI DST directly supports Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) by linking available equipment to the Generated Force model. 

Specifically, development will enable the tool to consume and display additional data sources, such as maintenance data from both legacy and Enterprise data sources- a critical capability during the fielding of  Global Combat Support System (GCSS)-Army; provide additional modules, including Second Destination Transportation Planning, supporting United States Army Reserve Command and National Guard Bureau requirements to deprecate legacy systems and a Readiness Cost Banding module to implement analysis algorithms to deliver decisions to optimize readiness within Army cost constraints. New development will also enable equippers to redistribute items, based on their level of modernization, limiting transportation costs of moving outdated equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The LMI DST is a development effort to meet the Secretary of the Army's intent in designating the Army Materiel Command as the Lead Materiel Integrator and the Logistics Information Warehouse (LIW) as the authoritative repository of Army logistics domain data. The LMI DST integrates logistics domain data from the LIW with materiel demand requirements from the Readiness Enterprise to enable automated decision support for equippers throughout the Army. In August 2011, a sole source contract was awarded to ProModel Corporation to leverage their COTS modeling and simulation capability, the ProModel Application Framework to develop the Lead Materiel Integrator Decision Support Tool, which is a GOTS product. The project utilizes an agile development methodology. Versions 1-4 were released on a six-month cadence between December 2011 and April 2013. LMI DST development and sustainment have been transitioned to LOGSA's Information and Technology Services Contract.  Requirements for additional development were collected from Army Commands and vetted through a General Officer Steering Committee, chaired by Army Materiel Command.  RDTE funding supports future major version releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aviation Rockets Product Improvement and Development line funds the development, integration and test of munitions and their interface to launcher and platforms to meet user requirements.  Additionally, it will fund a range of improvement initiatives to modernize the Hydra-70 2.75 Inch rocket and launcher system to include improvements to performance, safety, reliability, transportability, producibility, affordability and Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliance. The current Hydra-70 2.75 inch rocket system is more than 50 years old and is in need of performance improvements to comply with 1) USC - Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389, 2) DoD Directive 5000.1, CJCS Instruction 3170.01C, USD (AT&amp;L) Memorandum of January 26, 1999, "Exemption for Existing Inventory Items to IM Requirements", and 3) validated Lightweight Precision Munition (LPM) Operational Needs Statement ONS 16-21556 and 4) existing/emerging HQDA G-3/5/7 and TRADOC aviation weapon requirements for guided and unguided rocket systems. Improvements to existing rocket systems and munitions will include design, qualification and integration of precision guidance capability, increased lethality, improved target suppression, increased standoff range, reduced minimum engagement range, improved pre-launch constraints and munitions communications/programmability, increased stowed kills, increased product reliability, improved hardness against unplanned stimuli, reduced war fighter workload, and reduced environmental impact for both manned and unmanned applications.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Universal Products consist of the Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS), the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) and the Universal Mission Simulator (UMS), to support the Gray Eagle (MQ-1C) and Shadow (RQ-7) Programs of Record. The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple types of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). Protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS receives and disseminates battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles. Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.

The UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control, and UAS payload product. The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.

The Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1. The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of multiple types of unmanned aircraft systems and features Directorate of Simulation (DOS) accredited Shadow software and Gray Eagle software.

Justification: FY2019 Universal Product Base funding of $52.019 Million will be used for continuing the development of modifications needed to address UGCS obsolescence, maintain interoperability, increase commonality for the Gray Eagle (MQ-1C) and Shadow (RQ-7) Programs of Record, including System Engineering, Logistics, and Program Management.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) product office has full life-cycle management responsibility of the DoD authoritative biometrics enterprise repository system, known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS).  BEC Increment 0 is comprised of the current version (v1.2) of DoD ABIS and the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) which is DoD ABIS v1.3.  DoD ABIS supports identity superiority capabilities for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations.  DoD ABIS provides matching, sharing, and storing of biometrics data.  The capability can receive multi-modal biometrics submissions to include iris, face, palm, and finger prints from biometrics collection devices, which will support the Warfighter in making retain, capture, or release decisions.  DoD ABIS has a direct impact on the availability of critical intelligence information that is of vital interest to DoD and other government agencies, including Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of State (DoS).

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Agent for DoD Biometrics and the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD.  DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:

FY 2019 RDT&amp;E funding in the amount of $989 Thousand (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) supports developmental testing and limited user testing for the SLEP (DoD ABIS v 1.3) 
FY 2019 funding in the amount of $1.411 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army conducted a fair opportunity competition in FY17 to competitively select the contractor to continue to sustain the system and perform the Service Life Extension Project (SLEP) (DoD ABIS v1.3) Development and Deployment.  The resulting contract for DoD ABIS Sustainment Services and SLEP was awarded on June 30, 2017.  This upgrade is extremely critical in order to replace end of life hardware and software components, including Commercial Off the Shelf products whose versions currently included in DoD ABIS v1.2 are no longer supported.  The SLEP (v1.3) will extend the service life of the current capability through FY22 and transition to sustainment and will improve interoperability with other government entities such as the FBI, DHS, and Department of Justice.  The Army is currently staffing an Information System-Capability Development Document (IS-CDD) for BEC Increment 1 that will continue to improve upon the DoD ABIS.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) is the Executive Agent for DoD Biometrics and the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) and information management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD.  DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:

FY 2019 funding in the amount of $1.411 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage internal and external research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA conducts biometric activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software and hardware improvements for threat evolution:  Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM): Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the
Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment. Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous
engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Waveform Suite: Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current
and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system
improvements. The new waveforms enabled by the RDP allow capability improvements in Discrimination, Combat ID, Electronic Protection, Search, Tracking, and other areas of need.

THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability: Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact
Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations. Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and
planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability.

 Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles.

Task 7:  Performs analysis on existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures to determine the effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops hardware and software concepts to address countermeasure effects to ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.  Implements simulation based concepts to define tradespace and establish system requirements.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military's improved Global Position M-Code with Patriot Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense: Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks. Builds on
an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Tactical Telemetry Ground Station: Develops a ground-based telemetry receive station to be deployed with the tactical units and collect PAC-3 telemetry data for tactical
engagements. This data will be used to assess missile and system effectiveness in tactical environments against real-world threats, and will support the development of
operational improvements (Firing Doctrine and other system settings) and system software improvements to mitigate stressing threat behaviors.

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>FY2018 PIP funding of $90.2M was reduced to $65.4M in FY2019. Scheduled improvements are constrained by budget allocation for each respective fiscal year.  Current funding profile will enable the development of a capability to address evolving threats; however, any further reductions in funding will increase risk in delivering a mature, fully tested Combat ID capability in PDB-8.1.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.  Future hardware and software capabilities will be incorporated into future Post Deployment Build (PDB) releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a supporting program for Army and Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense, providing elevated, persistent, over the horizon surveillance and fire control quality data on Army and Joint networks, enabling protection of the U.S. and coalition forces as well as critical geo political assets from Cruise Missiles, Aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Tactical Ballistic Missiles, Large Caliber Rockets, and Surface Moving Targets. A JLENS Orbit consists of two systems: a fire control radar system and a wide-area surveillance radar system. Each radar system consists of a separate 74- meter tethered aerostat, mobile mooring station, radar and communications payload, processing station, and associated ground support equipment. The systems are designed to work together, but can operate independently. The JLENS Orbit is transportable by road, rail, sea and air.

JLENS uses advanced sensor and networking technologies to provide persistent, 360-degree, wide-area surveillance and precision tracking of Land Attack Cruise Missiles and other types of Air Breathing Threats. This information is distributed via joint service networks and provides fire control quality data to Surface to Air missile systems, such as Army Patriot and Navy Aegis, increasing the weapons' capabilities by allowing systems to engage targets normally below, outside, or beyond surface based weapons' field of view. JLENS also provides fire control quality data to fighter aircraft, allowing the aircraft to engage hostile threats from extended ranges, and contributes to the development of a single integrated air picture.

JLENS prepared and  participated in Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) with NORAD-USNORTHCOM National Capital Region (NCR) Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Operational Exercise (OPEX) from FY14-FY16 as directed by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 31 January 2013.  The OPEX included an operational assessment to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment", in accordance with Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 021-13. The Combatant Command (CCMD) objective for the OPEX was to provide the full range of JLENS Orbit level capability to include: Persistent Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) through Battle Command System Fixed (BCS-F) Integration Combat Identification (CID) / Electronic Identification (EID) Precision Cue to Fighters/Ground-Based Air Defense (GBAD) via Tactical Data Link (TDL) Integrated Fire Control to Fighters (IFC)/GBAD via TDL.

JLENS ended OPEX participation in October 2015 with the direction to store the system in place. 

JLENS received an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated 18 July 2017, directing the program to prepare and submit a program termination plan.  Disposition of 185 ISO containers consisting of classified and unclassified material along with 12 trailers will take two years (FY 2018-2019).  In FY 2018, the focus is on the disposition of classified and starting the disposition of unclassified material.  The remaining unclassified material will be disposed of in FY 2019.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JLENS participation in the OPEX was to allow for a combatant commander's operational assessment of JLENS capabilities to "inform a future decision for enduring operational employment". 

Operational Control of JLENS for the OPEX was transferred to the NORAD/NORTHCOM Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC) on 15 October 2015.  Due to a tether break accident on 28 October 2015 and resulting loss of the Fire Control System aerostat and significant damage to the Radar and Mobile Mooring Station, the Commander NORAD/NORTHCOM suspended JLENS participation in the OPEX pending results of accident investigations and Failure Review Board recommendations.  JLENS participation in the OPEX was terminated per an Under Secretary for Defense Policy decision memorandum dated 15 June 2016.  In accordance with Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) direction, JLENS equipment supporting the OPEX was packed and stored at the APG sites effective 21 June 2016, pending higher headquarters decision on the future of the JLENS program.

JLENS ended OPEX participation in October 2015 with the direction to store the system in place.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides development for fire support command and control systems used by all Services from platoon to echelons above Corps.  There are two developmental efforts that are being executed concurrently FY 2018 and beyond:  Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (Increment II) (project code EF7) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) (Increment I) (project code EF8).  The development on the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) (project code EF6) was completed in FY 2017.

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military. JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. 

Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. 

AFATDS 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS program currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JADOCS fires and targeting capabilities will migrate to AFATDS v 7.1.  JADOCS v2.0 will be sustained throughout the force until AFATDS 7.1 is fielded and satisfies the requirement for JADOCS fires and targeting functionality.  JADOCS v 2.0 software is being developed by CECOM Life Cycle Management Command, Software Engineering Center (SEC).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD.

FY 2019 funding of $3.884 million supports the evolutionary software development and testing of PFED Increment II and transition to the mounted computing environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 18 May 2015, the Milestone Decision Authority (PEO C3T) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment II Milestone B. The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program. The system received a limited deployment decision in Dec 2016 to enter into operational test and subsequently expects to receive full material release in Jan 2018

PFED Increment II leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (e.g. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PFED Increment II will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PFED Increment II software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.

PM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability blocks of software development. PM Mission Command will continue to coordinate with PM Soldier Warrior to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS software currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction. 

FY 2019 funding in the amount of $27.070 million will be used to continue development efforts on AFATDS version 7.0.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 May 2015, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that a modernization of the existing AFATDS software code is required to comply with Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to be executed as AFATDS 7.0. In V7.0, the PM will re-design AFATDS to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, integration of COE compliant architectures and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds development efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2).  PE Number 0203735A/Project FD8 funds the development of LAV25 enhancements.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of Single Vehicle Recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2 SEPv3 fielding in FY 2020 will further exacerbate the recovery problem.

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

M113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).

Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Improved Target Acquisitions System (ITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY2020.

Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This will directly support the expeditionary maneuver excursion that will be conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY17-18.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES), designated as an ACAT IC program on 15 Jun 2016, has been providing towing, winching, and hoisting operations to support battlefield recovery operations and evacuation of heavy tanks and other tracked combat vehicles since its production and deployment in 1998.  The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles.  Currently, the M88A2 is unable to safely perform Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of the Abrams tank in all conditions, due to added weight/survivability improvements made to the tank. In order to ensure SVR is met, Project Director- Main Battle Tank Systems (PD-MBTS) will develop and integrate technologies for the M88A2 HERCULES through an Operations and Support (O&amp;S) initiative to meet its operational requirements of SVR throughout its life cycle. This initiative is not intended to exceed current operational capability, but will instead regain SVR capability of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.

Technical assessments and analyses will be used to evaluate design solutions to meet SVR, and inform key program decision points. The goal of the assessments  will be to provide confidence to Army Leadership that a M88A2 HERCULES solution is affordable, achievable, and feasible using existing technology with manageable risk. Limited analyses, conducted to date, suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, hydraulics, engine, transmission and other related components are required.

FY 2019 Base dollars will be used to continue the development of SVR ECP, initiate fabrication of vehicle prototypes, and continue the development of the transmission upgrade ECP (the longest developmental item).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army has approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for the Abrams Main Battle Tank to restore lost capability, host inbound technologies, and to meet objective performance requirements called out in approved platform requirements documents. The strategy for Abrams will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future. This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY2011.

The Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development, and technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank and technologies in support of any validated Army requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Bradley Family of Vehicles is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing programs of record, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). ECP 1 improves vehicle's track and suspension while the Bradley A4 ECP improves the power train and electrical system to enable the A3 fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including continued SINCGARS integration and Handheld Manpack Small (HMS) Radios and Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P). The Bradley A4 development effort led to a production decision in FY 2017. The Bradley M2A4/M7A4 Vehicle is the combination of the M2A3/M7A3 Base Vehicle with ECP 1 and ECP 2 components installed and integrated.  Additionally, a follow on Engineering Change Proposal to the Bradley A4 ECP, Bradley A5 ECP (Lethality) integrates Third Generation Forward Looking Infrared (3GEN FLIR) to replace the current FLIR for increased lethality through improved target acquisition capability along with other technology upgrades and insertions (i.e. laser pointing, color camera, laser range finder, etc). Product Manager Bradley will characterize a Non Developmental Item (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort began in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds development efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades will both restore Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD ONS effort will address an Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort will integrate a 30mm-equipped weapon station that will provide USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Improved Target Acquisitions System (ITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>AAE approval for a 3rd Double V-Hull (DVH) SBCT Brigade of 337 Exchange Vehicles was given on July 26, 2013 (funded in G85100). A successful production decision for the DVH A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) was executed on July 22, 2016, which provided approval to begin 4th Brigade DVH A1 ECP production (funded in Stryker Upgrade - G85200).  Approval to procure an additional 123 DVH A1 ECP vehicles was received through a successful decision point on April 26, 2017.  Stryker MOD (GM0100) supports Stryker Fleet modifications to include Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) production and fielding in FY16-18, DVH A1 ECP retrofits in FY19-23, and Lethality ECP retrofits in FY19-23.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II was approved continuing design and integration of ECP 1 mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades, and the in-vehicle network upgrades.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP 1 efforts on the DVH platform and defer efforts on flat-bottom Strykers.  The effort has subsequently been renamed the Stryker DVH A1 ECP.  The DVH A1 ECP Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The initial DVH A1 ECP production contract was awarded in October 2016 (Sole-Source Firm Fixed Price arrangement).  A second buy of DVH A1 ECP vehicles was awarded in October 2017 (Fixed Price Incentive Fee arrangement).

On July 2, 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker 30mm ICVD Operational Needs Statement (ONS) effort.  30mm ICVD Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development/Test Support were awarded in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The 30mm ICVD ONS Production/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.

The Stryker Lethality ECP efforts will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon system, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J), common masted sensor, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the Stryker CROWS-J ECP and ATGM ECP efforts was received in a September 30, 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                        <r2:Text>The Army plans to use 6 LAV-25A2s in a training excursion to inform operational concepts for Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Teams in support of Global Response Force early entry operation and to determine airdrop feasibility.  XVIII Airborne Corps will have an opportunity to assess operational employment of LAV-25A2s, develop tactics, techniques and procedures and assess the air drop feasibility through air certification testing.  The Army plans to determine whether or not to field additional LAV-25A2s to XVIII Airborne Corps based on results of the excursion and air drop testing.  

In FY2018 the Army will complete air certification testing to determine LAV-25A2 airdrop feasibility.  If the excursion is successful and the Army decides to field additional vehicles it is anticipated that additional modifications and testing will be required to address upgrades to survivability, mobility, integrate Army communications equipment and add obsolescence upgrades for commonality with USMC fielded systems.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The current Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT1C Acquisition program. The PIM improvement program is intended to address the current Howitzer capability gap based on a capability needs assessment performed by the user community to restore indirect fires support overmatch to the US Army.  This effort will evaluate developing technologies to determine which configuration will add optimal value to the Army.   This effort may include but is not limited to the integration of a new cannon, gun mount, gun drive systems, fire control systems and autoloader into the M109A7 Howitzer.  Analysis will be required to evaluate the impact of the new cannon technology on current platform chassis, cab, suspension, mobility, and electronic architecture.  This evaluation will be the foundation for this Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) and further inform the level of effort needed to integrate this capability into the current SPHS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Will conduct a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) comparing several different packages of upgrades for the M109A7.  Each upgrade package will be evaluated for cost, technology readiness and added performance.  At the conclusion of the CBA the Army will be better informed to choose a path which can be sole source with the current vendor, open competition, or continue with government development through Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD).  This work effort is to pursue Objective Indirect Fire Range Requirement in the current M109 FOV Capability Production Document (CPD).  The effort will address increased range requirements from a holisitic development process.  Program will focus on gun mount, breech, tube, and fire control.  It will be designed around M109A7 objective requirements for range. It is intended to address capability gaps as identified by the Army Chief of Staff.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MQ-1C Gray Eagle provides the Army with an extended range, multi-purpose (ERMP) unmanned aircraft system (UAS); capable of executing reconnaissance, security, attack, and intelligence collection missions in the range of military operations (ROMO). Sensors/payloads include an Electro-Optical/Infrared/Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD), Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Hellfire missiles; providing a near all-weather mission capability. MQ-1C Gray Eagle is a dedicated, assured, multi-mission Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) fielded to all Army Divisions, Intelligence and Security Command and Army Special Operations Command in support of the commander's warfighting priorities.

The MQ-1C Gray Eagle Modification/Product Improvement Program (PIP) funding is required for Global Positioning System (GPS) Denied, an electronic warfare capability, and Ground Based Sense And Avoid (GBSAA) Block II.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Aircraft Modification/Product Improvement funding of $17.706 million will support the development required to integrate Alternate Munition, and GPS Denied for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle product.  GBSAA RDTE will provide development, integration and testing for Block II.  Block II decreases operational and sustainment costs, operator workload, hardware/software costs, increases system safety, and provides full materiel release for Soldier operation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.

The RDTE funded elements for GPS Denied, UGCS Improvements and Alternate Munition Integration addressed in this submission are planned for award on the
Gray Eagle Engineering Services contract as a Sub-Engineering Services Memorandum (SESM) task order, and as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government Agencies. The purpose of the SESMs is to mature the respective designs to a level that Engineering Change Requests (ECR) are submitted to the Government via the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Following successful completion of the SESM and CCB approval, a contract modification to retrofit and/or cut-in the respective engineering change will be awarded on the appropriate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) or Production contract.  The RDTE funded element for GBSAA Block II addressed in this submission are planned for award on various contracts and MIPR actions to other government agencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Horizontal Battlefield Digitization is a strategy that allows warfighters, from the individual soldier and platform to echelons above corps, to share critical situation awareness (SA) and command and control (C2) information. It conducts analysis and evaluation of new information technologies, concepts, and applications of integrated management activities. Digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the operational environment, are used to provide an operational picture for leaders. This timely sharing of information significantly improves the ability to quickly make decisions, synchronize forces and fires, and increase the operational tempo. The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat material, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of hardware and software from a System of Systems (SOS) perspective. 3) Develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) programs into a single integrated system. 

Digitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) continued development and integration of the Force Development Investment Information System (FDIIS), Army Flow Model (AFM), and the Force Development Knowledge Center (FDKC) into an improved, single system. Continued development of the suite of the AE2S applications is necessary to create and improve workflow efficiencies amongst various organizations and data base systems, Active and Reserve Component equipment transparency reporting requirements, and Active and Reserve equipment fielding plans to the Solider according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN). Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems.  Specifically, these FFRDC projects support Army Mission Command and network architecture (operational and systems) development, technical and policy document review in support of planning and acquisition, network and joint integration and interoperability evaluations and assessments, program and database analysis, independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement.  In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the identification, assessment and acquisition of capability solutions for the Army.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The Avenger's mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Cruise Missiles (CM), and Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing aircraft. Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.

The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD - SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. Avenger MOD-SLEP ensures that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of program life. Avenger MOD-SLEP maintains operational capability of Avenger until replaced by the Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2- Intercept (IFPC Inc 2-I) in the Fiscal Year (FY) 31 timeframe.  

The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance. 

Funding provided for the Stinger Product Improvement completes design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.

Also funded under DT5 (Stinger Product Improvement), the Maneuver - Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) demonstration in 4QFY17 assessed available industry solutions for mitigating the M-SHORAD gap in the near term. The intent is to inform requirements and identify what capability could be fielded by FY21 in order to help mitigate this critical air defense gap. This project moved to its own PE, 0604117A (Short Range air Defense(M-SHORAD)), Project FI4 (Maneuver - Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD)), starting in FY18.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Avenger PIP consists of the ongoing Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP). Avenger MOD-SLEP provides development and testing of six key Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through FY31, when the IFPC Inc 2-I system is fielded. The six LRUs are: Targeting Console (TC), .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P), Avenger Fire Control Computer - Revised (AFCC-R), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC-5) and the Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Unit (ECU/PPU) governor and starter. 

FY2019 Base dollars in the amount of $1.643 million supports activities to ensure the Avenger is viable and sustainable through FY31, the end of its program life.  The funding will contribute to the testing, test support and materiel release package for the AFCC-R, IFF, VIC-5 and ECU/PPU.

FY2019 OCO dollars in the amount of $2.000 million supports redesign of Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) for the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stinger Block I missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, air defense weapon system. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low- altitude air defense against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and cruise missiles (CM). Stinger is deployable from the shoulder or from a variety of platforms to include vehicles, helicopters and UAS. The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

Funding provided for the Stinger Product Improvement completes design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.

The Stinger Product Improvement also funded the Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) demonstration in 4QFY17. This assessed available industry solutions for mitigating the Maneuver SHORAD gap in the near term. The intent is to inform requirements and identify what capability could be fielded by FY21 in order to help mitigate this critical air defense gap. Starting in FY18, the Maneuver SHORAD effort has been moved to its own PE, 0604117A, for all future requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary all-weather, surface-to-surface long-range artillery precision guided missile used by Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard &amp; soft targets in open, complex, and urban environments. 

788: ATACMS Product Improvement Program (PIP) focuses on safety, cost reduction, reliability, deficiency corrections, standardization, and new or improved
operational capabilities. FY19 Base funds in the amount of $4.947 million supports completion of operational testing, corrections of identified deficiencies, and fielding support activities for a Height-of-Burst capability via proximity sensor, GPS M-Code Study &amp; Prototyping, Insensitive Munitions Study and other evolving capabilities. Additional supporting efforts include launcher software and training updates to enable firing for new ATACMS configuration.

DZ9: Block (BLK) I/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration. There is no funding in FY19. 

VT9: Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile System (LMAMS) develops, integrates, and tests the Switchblade Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL).  Multi-Pack Launcher provides the capability to launch up to 6 Switchblade missiles remotely in a Force Protection Environment. The mission for the MPL is to be placed in a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in a constant ready-to-use state to enable Soldiers to remain in the safety of a building while launching Switchblade missiles.  There is no funding in FY19. .</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the United States (U.S.) Army's primary 24/7, all-weather, and surface-to-surface artillery precision missile used by current and future Combatant Commanders to shape the battlefield with long-range fires against hard and soft stationary targets in open, complex, and urban environments. Block (BLK) I/IA ATACMS currently have warheads that are non-compliant with the 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) policy on cluster munitions (CM). Starting with a BLK I/IA missile, this modification effort will integrate, test, and qualify an ATACMS configuration to include a policy compliant warhead, obsolescence refresh, and re-grained rocket motors. Performance of a characterization effort will include qualification and flight testing to assess ATACMS performance with inclusion of a proximity sensor. Additional efforts include launcher updates to enable firing of the new ATACMS configuration.

There is no FY19 funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>PE 0205402A has now been realigned into two separate PEs for Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C).  Beginning in FY 2017 Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) funding is under PE0605033A Project EQ3.  Beginning in FY 2017 Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) funding is under PE0605029A Project EQ2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>GBOSS-E:  Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System - Expeditionary (GBOSS-E) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System-Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities and will provide network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. GBOSS-E will replace obsolete, quick reaction capability (QRC) surveillance and force protections systems utilizing modular configurations: Medium variant (mid sensor height) for small to medium size base, and Heavy variant (high level sensor height) for large contingency base camps. GBOSS-E will operate in a stand-alone mode or as part of an integrated network utilizing government owned software, be easily operated and maintained, and be rugged enough to support employment in expeditionary operations worldwide.

IGSSR-C:  The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) is an Automated Information System (AIS) program. IGSSR-C has a requirement to provide a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems with automated fusion capabilities. The system will provide a Force Protection (FP) Common Operational Picture (COP) capability for CONUS fixed, OCONUS semi-fixed or expeditionary elements in all Operating Environments (OE). This capability will enable rapid decision analysis, speed the response process as well as increase information dissemination horizontally and vertically along the chain of command and with outside supporting organizations. IGSSR-C is a software centric fusion engine that connects legacy and emerging FP systems, legacy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), unmanned systems, biometric identification and forensic data systems. The desired end state is to achieve interoperability and COP with current and emerging FP systems used by Joint Forces, Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and multi-national forces.

Integrated Base Defense (IBD): The purpose of IBD Kitting is to harvest and refurbish physical security and Force Protection (FP) Non-Standard Equipment (NS-E) and package them into integrated and interoperable IBD Capabilities.  IBD provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base and Installation Protection (IUBIP) framework.  In support of JUONS 0540 to address the Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) threat.  Additional capabilities are being developed and integrated to the current Force Protection structure.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) will replace the interim Persistent Surveillance System - Ground (PSS-G) Increment 1 towers with improved persistent surveillance capabilities along with network integration and better mobility utilizing modular configurations. The G-BOSS(E) Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved May 2014. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. G-BOSS(E) received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015. Pending successful Milestone B decision in FY 2017, the existing United States Marine Corps (USMC) tower's design (Ground Based Operational Surveillance System) (GBOSS) will be leveraged and modified to meet the Army's G-BOSS(E) program requirements. The acquisition strategy for G-BOSS(E) was signed by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 11 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) at Crane, Indiana and the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to provide system design, development, and integration support, as well as a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support future procurements. The Heavy Tower Trailer, EO/IR, and RF Sensor which are the main cost drivers for the system will be competitively awarded through the product office and provided to a prime integrator with the TDP to construct future GBOSS-E systems.  Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align G-BOSS(E), IGSSR-C, and Tactical Security System (TSS) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) provides a layered approach to integrate sensors, sensor systems and unmanned systems. The IGSSR-C Capability Design Document (CDD) was approved September 2013. IGSSR-C is made up of a suite of software that achieves integration, fusion and interoperability in support of the Army Acquisition Executive's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Compute Environment (CPCE) and Sensor CE efforts. In FY 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group (PSEAG) provided funds to conduct pre-milestone B activities. IGSSR-C received an approved Materiel Development Decision (MDD) from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) on 4 December 2015.  The acquisition strategy for IGSSR-C was signed by the MDA on 5 December 2016, which approved plans to leverage the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Fort Belvoir, Virginia to develop, integrate and test the Initial Capability (IC).  Milestone C is planned for FY 2020 to align Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)), Tactical Security System (TSS) and Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) in order to gain programmatic efficiencies. 

The IBD acquisition strategy is to leverage existing IBD-related government organizations and to competitively award multiple contracts in support of IBD objectives for the development of holistic IBD architectures and products to support interoperability of fielded and emerging IBD-related systems.

FY19 funding supports IBD JUONS 0540. Product Manager Force Protection Systems is overseeing the integration of both Commercial Off The Shelf and Government developed technologies that will address the identified capability gap to the existing Force Protection structure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) Program is an Office of the Secretary of the Secretary of Defense sponsored program that was assigned to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health as the Department of Defense (DoD) overarching authority by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics in 2001. The DoD Directive 4715.1E defined EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting, and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders. Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to continue to develop and modernize the system to meet requirements set forth by the DoD's Risk Management Framework (DoDI 8510.01) as well as the Defense Information Systems Agency's Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide. Prior to funding being committed, DoD ESOH stakeholders, authoritative information technology organizations, and the program's functional sponsor were consulted to determine necessary system interface upgrades to be incorporated. Expanding DENIX's architecture to create a Level 2 container separate from the current Level 4 container will not only provide a more secure, cybersecurity risk-adverse environment, but it will also optimize performance, capabilities, and mandatory reporting for ESOH stakeholders. This phased solution begins in FY 2018 by prototyping of system architecture optimization that improves user experience, enabling web conferencing in FY 2019 and applying machine learning concepts to improve data quality in FY 2020-2022.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (PAC-2, Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement) and Ground Support Equipment. As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing. Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints. Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. 

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

Funding supports identification, analysis, design, and test materiel solutions to counter cyber security and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space.

FY2019 base dollars in the amount of $79.283 million supports the continuance of program development with the integration of missile and ground system software and hardware in support of complete Post Deployment Build-8.1 (PDB-8.1). Continues the testing program to support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and system testing/analysis long lead activities for PDB-8.1 Development Test and Evaluation (DTE) and Limited User Test (LUT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ongoing design and developmental activities enable modeling and simulation infrastructure maintenance and upgrades coupled with end to end testing of the Lower Tier architecture against the evolving threat as an element of an integrated Air and Missile Defense system. This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  Lower Tier system development efforts enable further improvement of system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  Developing, fabricating and testing hit to kill surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment provides essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats. These state-of-the-art capabilities and enhancements require ongoing demonstration through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Projects EG2/EG3. GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges with a cluster compliant warhead.

The GMLRS Program consists of three variants: GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets; GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to replace GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary is currently in full rate production. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in FY 2015. The GMLRS AW rocket is 90% common with the Unitary variant.

The GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) efforts to extend range, increase survivability, and develop warhead technologies to meet DOD Cluster Munition Policy requirements. The Extended Range GMLRS variant will be a modification of the current production GMLRS and will be remain approximately 85% common with the current GMLRS. It will carry both the Unitary and AW warheads. It will extend the current GMLRS capability to 150 km and allow for potential future growth capability in the payload section.

The FY2019 dollars in the amount of $154.102 million will continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades (including the M-Code compliant NAVSTRIKEM upgrade); qualify a new rocket pod in support of future GMLRS production; and continue the design, qualification, and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS.

The United States (U.S.) Army has identified funding in FY2021-FY2023 for the technology transition, development and integration of an anti-radiation homing (ARH) future payload into the GMLRS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Project EG3 is intended to support, investigate, and develop alternative material changes to improve the GMLRS family of munitions as they are identified by the material developer or combat developer. This project also supports IM activities to improve the overall posture of the system down to component level. Two Insensitive Munition Propulsion Systems (Rocket Motor and Ignition Safety Device) suppliers will complete design and qualification, and the IMPS will be integrated into the GMLRS rocket. Design, development, and qualification of a side-mounted proximity sensor will provide a cost reduction initiative and improved area munition lethality. The GMLRS extended range effort is pursuing a strategy of modifying the current system in order to increase its range.  It will be a 36 month development and qualification effort leveraging existing contract vehicles where practicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 and Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 efforts are included under PE 0208053A. JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS ORD thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 and Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 efforts are included under PE 0208053A. JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Details of this program are reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119,(a)(1).

This project provides the Army with a new capability to communicate near-real-time (NRT) updates from advanced sensors to elements in theater who can prosecute the adversary. This capability greatly enhances the ground commander's battlespace awareness by integrating additional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms with Army Mission Command Systems (MCS) during the find, fix, and finish process. The increased battlespace awareness contributes to more effective and efficient use of fire support platforms like artillery. NRT updates to the intelligence picture allows forces to rapidly tailor fire support plans to make better use of existing assets. Providing NRT updates aids weapon and ammunition selection decisions based on current enemy disposition. FY 2019 request includes $0.799 million for these activities in support of Operation Inherent Resolve for ISIL.

This capability supports operational gaps and supports documented Army requirements. This funding provides resources to complete integration efforts into Army MCS. Initial integration testing is complete and shows the ability to produce the desired end state of passing intelligence data to the end user. Development efforts include interface refinement and measurement of message latency under a variety of realistic environments, which culminates in participation in live fire events. During the ongoing development of this capability, the project will receive and respond to feedback from the warfighter to ensure that the capability meets the warfighter's needs.

HQDA G-2 and the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Security Operations Center (ISOC) are charged with integrating, informing, and leveraging security and counterintelligence authorities in support of the Department of the Army Insider Threat Program mission to continuously deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats to Army information, networks, facilities, and personnel.  

The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Modernization Project supports ongoing rejuvenation and development of new critical CI and HUMINT systems, applications, tools, equipment, and capabilities necessary to defeat the foreign intelligence, international terrorist, and insider threats while enhancing our HUMINT collection capability.  The required tools provide Army and DoD leadership, commanders, and warfighters the intelligence necessary for making advantageous operational planning, policies, and timely decisions. Funding will transfer to 0606003 FI9 Counter Intel and Human Intel Modernization in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Assurance Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Information Assurance Development funding implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI).  Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the COMSEC Implementation Planning Guidance to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the Department of Defense (DoD) and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan.  This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS, System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks. 

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield.  It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics.  Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems. 

The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program, automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute Cryptographic data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Management Client (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device Family of fill devices.  The NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Program replaced NSA EKMS program. AKMI has replaced Army Key Management System.  The transition from AKMS to AKMI started in FY12.  The AKMS System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Simple Key Loader (SKL).

The Army COMSEC program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army network (which is made up of tactical and enterprise networks). This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.

User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) funding line DV4 was established in FY2014.  Army Key Management System (AKMS) funding line 501 realigned to KMI funding line DV4 in FY2017.  AKMI supports infrastructure requirements in support of Key Management.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  

The AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small and Medium.  AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern End Crypto Units (ECU)s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI. 

One of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI.  The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's.  The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices.  NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.  
   
The NGLD Medium is reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed. The KOV-21 card currently used in Army Simple Key Loader (SKL) fill devices has hardware obsolescence issues and does not support OTNK. Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL devices have been initiated under the RESCUE program. The current KOV-21 card is referred to as the KOV-21 Replacement and is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion. The follow-on RESCUE technology development will start in FY2018.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>KMI Awareness initiative creates a secure, highly automated interface in providing future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to legacy End Crypto Units (ECU)s.  This initiative will allow ECUs to receive, authenticate, and decrypt OTNK messages and increases WarFighter survivability by minimizing the need for Soldiers to travel to obtain keys. The KOV 21 card, previously in production through NSA for use in the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and the Secure DTD 2000 System (SDS), is nearing the end of life due to unavailability of parts. Redesigning and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's SKL and Next Generation Load Devices (NGLDs) are currently underway. The redesign of the current KOV 21 card is referred to as the KOV 21 Replacement and is an extension of the KOV 21 card as a technology insertion. The KOV 21 Replacement will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the AKMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the KOV 21 card.</r2:Description>

B96004: Key Management Infrastructure (OPA2)
432140: ISSP (TSEC-AKMS) (OMA)</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E).  AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record.  The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks. 

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family. Each component of the AKMI Program is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  

The NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017.  Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.  

The NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army fill devices and Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 2 devices (small and medium) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE). The Army will gain the NGLD Medium capability through the SKL v3.1 in combination with a new KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the RESCUE, the first iteration of the RESCUE being
the KOV-21 Replacement. The redesign of the current SKL cryptographic engine, the KOV-21 card, is required due to parts obsolescence and inability to be KMI Aware. The KOV-21 Replacement is an extension of the RESCUE program as a technology insertion into the SKL v3.1 which in turn meets the NGLD Medium CPD requirements. The NGLD Medium will be available in FY19. The follow-on RESCUE technology development will start in FY2019.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports using National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

The Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action, conduct a Material Solution Analysis, and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employ embedded cryptographic hardware will utilize modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The objective of this program is to integrate and validate hardware and software solutions to provide COMSEC superiority in order to protect against threats, increase battlefield survivability/lethality, and enable critical Mission Command activities. The objective of the Cryptographic Systems program is to provide adaptive, flexible, and programmable cryptographic systems using best practices, lessons learned and programmatic management to meet the challenge of modernizing the Army's aging cryptographic systems. The effort will support the network operations from end-to-end throughout the force and the Common Operating Environment (COE) thus mitigating networked vulnerabilities to Army information security systems.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017 DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) for Defense Business Systems, applying to Global Combat Support System.  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in DoDI  5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed (ATPs)" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. The GCSS-Army approved Capability Description Document (CDD) and Capability Production Document (CPD) require an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). GCSS-Army will provide the Army's Sustainment Support for the soldier with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. AESIP will provide the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics. GCSS-Army will implement best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.

Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-Army will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit / installation logistics and financial system for the U.S. Army. GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will track supplies, spare parts and organizational equipment. It will track unit maintenance, total cost of ownership and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units. This modernized application will subsume outdated Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) that are not financially compliant and integrate numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system. GCSS-Army will be financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise strategy to be financially auditable. When fully deployed, GCSS-Army will affect every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Logistics Readiness Centers (LRCs) and property book office in the Army.
GCSS-Army will modernize automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, and tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is a key component of the Federated ERP Integration solution that will optimize tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single federated approach.  Delivering GCSS-Army will eliminate the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems that are not cyber compliant, resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP is the principle GCSS-Army Business Intelligence system and will aggregate data for enterprise reporting. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The Army has successfully addressed concerns about the lack of integration of ERPs by leveraging AESIP core capabilities and expanding those benefits across the Army enterprise. AESIP will be an Army specific commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) web portal implementation via the NetWeaver Platform from developer Systems Applications and Products (SAP) American Group to support Army process scenarios and requirements that will provide core competencies:

Enterprise Service Bus (Hub Services) - For a Service oriented, Single Point of Entry to connect, mediate, and control the exchange of data.
Enterprise Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse - Aggregates data from ERP and non-ERP systems to provide flexible Enterprise level reporting.
Enterprise Master Data Management - For a single source of authoritative data and improved workflow and business processes. 

The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Enhance the Customer Vender Solution (CVS); required for migrating remaining customer functionality into ERP Central Component (ECC) and expanding customer records. Expand Business Analytics capability across the Army providing access to data from ERP and non-ERP systems; retiring duplicative capabilities.

Additional FY17 Appropriations:
Funds will be used to develop Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) technology application to AESIP, to include data warehousing functionality, a business intelligence platform, and a suite of business intelligence tools integrated to the enterprise. Relevant business information from productive SAP applications and all external data sources will be integrated, transformed, and consolidated in BI with the toolset provided.  PM will develop an integration architecture for data warehousing workbench, a BI platform, Business Explorer suite, open analysis interfaces, and apply other technologies to AESIP and the ERP suite.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component titled Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP). GCSS-Army coupled with AESIP are information and communications technology investments that currently provides provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. 
Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-Army will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GCSS-Army Increment 2 continues the evolutionary acquisition strategy of Increment 1 and will define, develop, and deploy additional and enhanced capabilities to GCSS-Army based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities. 

GCSS-Army Increment 2 is being implemented in three waves:

Wave 1 provides the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance capability.

Wave 2 provides the enhanced Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) capability.

Wave 3 provides the Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) capability

Effective February 2, 2017 DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) for Defense Business Systems, applying to Global Combat Support System.  This DoDI supersedes DoDI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across DoD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in DoDI  5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed (ATPs)" and replace DoDI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) systems are joint program/project efforts to satisfy ground mobile requirements for each Service, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the National Command Authority, the combatant commanders, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other governmental, non-DoD users.  The worldwide MILSATCOM systems are: the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS); the MILSTAR Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR); the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF); and future MILSATCOM capabilities. All of these systems are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and Future Force requirements. The Army is responsible for materiel development, acquisition, product improvement, testing, fielding and integrated logistics support of ground satellite terminals and SATCOM control subsystems and all associated equipment used to provide range extension of Mission Command Networks and Systems. The Army also participates in the development of MILSATCOM programs, including architectures, payloads, waveforms, antennas and terminal developments to ensure US Army equities are appropriately addressed with our sister services.  This includes technology assessment efforts associated with the integration of MILSATCOM components to US Army LandWarNet. This responsibility also includes maintaining the life cycle logistics support required to achieve end-to-end connectivity and interoperability, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, Military Departments, Department of State, and other government Departments and Agencies. EMC supports Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forcible entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command.  

This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides funds to develop Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS).  DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements.  Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role.  DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations in support of the President, JCS, combatant commanders, military departments, Department of State and other government departments and agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>As result of the new Major Force Program 12 (MFP12) Space Configuration, OSD directed this funding line transition to OSD PE 1203142/FE1 in FY 2018 and beyond.

This effort finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) Netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and DoD Information Assurance Certification Accreditation Process (DIACAP) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FY 2017 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), the follow-on Wideband AoA, and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.

FY 2018 and out funding will be realigned to 1203142A/FE2 to reflect the new Major Force Program 12 (MFP12) Space configuration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase, designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends, to Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination phases culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities enabling legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment. FY17 funds are in support of T2C2 systems (Light and Heavy) Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) to inform a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision scheduled for 4Q FY17 (on track).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) program Acquisition Strategy (AS) is based on integration of existing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Items (NDI) into new integrated systems fielded in the needed configuration for small teams or small unit Command Posts (CP) to allow these units to receive and transmit data. T2C2 will provide a high bandwidth tactical network extension for small unit CPs operating beyond line-of-sight from their higher headquarters and for teams operating outside the full tactical network architecture. The acquisition strategy leverages an existing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract supporting the commercialization of the preceding SBIR efforts. T2C2 will utilize a two-level maintenance concept, will be Soldier-maintained, and initially supported by Interim Contractor Support. An analysis will be conducted to determine the ultimate supportability path. This strategy will allow a capability to be integrated and delivered quickly to support a limited deployment of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY17 required for Production Verification and the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E), with Full-Rate Production (FRP) planned for 4Q FY17.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  

FY17 funding will support test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).  The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The continued procurement of the EMC full operational capability follows DoDI 5000.02, 7 Jan 2015, Enclosure 13, Rapid Fielding of Capabilities. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and project manager will tailor and streamline program strategy based on the required timelines to meet urgent need capability requirements. The Army Executive Agent signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 27 April 2015 delegating MDA to PEO C3T.  The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability (FOC). An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.  

Due to rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18/19, program has been restructured.  Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).   Full Operational Capability (FOC) is 35 C-17s, seven KENs and 21 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN) and an airborne command post suite (CASPAN).  FOC is currently projected for FY20.  Planning to field an interim capability and conduct an Operational Assessment in FY17.

FY17 RDT&amp;E funding supports test by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) during Operational Assessment (OA).  The OA supports the Milestone Decision Authority (MA) Disposition Decision (FY18) to continue procurement and fielding.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A): This project is the Army component system that directly supports the implementation of the Global Command and Control System Family of Systems. GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools for Army Strategic and Operational Theater Commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during joint and combined operations in support of National Security. The GCCS-A developed software systems dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action; develop and manage Army Forces; and ensure feasibility of war plans. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A was re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) and Mission Command Workstation. GCCS-A strategic tools for readiness reporting have been modernized and replaced with the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army (DRRS-A), a suite of web based applications for Army Readiness, Force Registration and Force Projection.
 
Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 provides Army leaders: Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and Coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management.

GCCS-A will transition into sustainment in FY19.

Fiscal Year 2019 base funding will support the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Army  (DRRS-A), the Army's capability for unit readiness reporting, unit registration and force planning and projection activities that enables Title 10 reporting to Congress.  Specifically the funding will provide program oversight and technical development, testing and training support to enable the readiness and force projection capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GCCS-A Modernization Strategy consists of two separate program efforts. (1) A Bridge effort, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III level and (2) a Modernization development effort for the Army's Joint and Strategic command and Control capabilities infrastructure software products. The GCCS-A modernization development effort will be in compliance with Joint Command and Control Capability Development Document (JC2 CDD) and Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). DRRS-A will continue to satisfy readiness reporting requirements from Army Readiness Division (DAMO-ODR). The Bridge Effort's acquisition approach consists of a support agreement with CECOM LCMC SEC as the prime software developer utilizing a mix of government and contractor support.

The DRRS-A development effort in FY19 is accomplished through an existing Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with Sotera Defense Solutions Inc. and testing is managed at the Army Software Engineering Center at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the Army Mission Command for Unified Action (AMCUA) CDP approved December of 2014. The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.

The acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the "Information Technology (IT) Box" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Terminals supports the Joint Services and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  The IBS transmits worldwide time-sensitive tactical and strategic intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational users.  The JPO is responsible for coordinating modernization and sustainment of IBS terminals compatible with the UHF SATCOM IBS broadcasts.  The JPO is pursuing a next generation non-developmental item to replace the existing Joint Tactical Terminals (JTT).  The transmit/receive-capable JTT systems currently consist of the JTT-Senior and JTT-IBS configurations, and they satisfy the radio communication Key Performance Parameters for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY2018 funding of $4,700,000 was re-aligned in accordance to Project 11B scheduled Test Event of the desired Signal of Interest in FY19 on the UAS Grey Eagle platform and MQ-1C (ER).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. 

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infrared / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities.  Additional initiatives will continue to focus on the transition of technologies directly supporting emerging requirements and the Army's Current and Future Force.     

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  

Project 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>MQ-1 PAYLOAD - UAS - A00020 was a shared Aircraft Procurement, Army (APA)  funding line for CSP, STARLite and Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP).  
STARLite (A01003), and CSP (A01005) are broken into individual lines within MQ-1Payload (MIP) (A01001).

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet a KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirement. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in Nov 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was completed June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDT&amp;E activities. The Enhanced EO/IR Capability Production Document, approved 19 Dec 2016, defines additional KPP requirements for Full Motion Video (FMV) sensors.  The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the High Definition (HD) variation of the CSP.  Currently, units are being fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit.  The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor with rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA).  The acquisition strategy for CSP in FY 2019 is to mature Software and Hardware efforts for CSP that reduce cognitive burdens on the Warfighter, improve situational awareness, provide multiple fields of view, and enhance targeting capabilities.   

The acquisition strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support to the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) to continue enhancing CSP's usability for the Warfighter to reduce cognitive burden by providing improved situational awareness, while providing multiple fields of view in a simplified manner through Hardware (H/W) and S/W improvements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 FDI/G8 has ceased EE PEG Investment (FY19-FY23) for TSP POR in support of acquisition strategy of QRCs towards a Family of Systems to meet the critical SIGINT capability need with the desired Signals of Interest on the UAS Grey Eagle Platform and the MQ-1C (ER).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition with a period of performance that was completed in October 2015, and focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform, and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. 

The TSP program entered the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase with a Milestone C decision that was approved on 2 May 2014. The TSP Program LRIP contract award was based on sole source selection with a period of performance that was completed on June 2016, and primarily focused on the obsolescence of the EMD phase assets via the required Engineering Change Proposals, and the first initial production of 30 TSP Payloads in support of the Gray Eagle Platform. The TSP Program ICLS contract award was a result of  previous sole selection with a period of performance of 12-months with a 5 year option for total completion into August 2021. The primary focus supports fielding of system, continuous contractual support through operational and sustainment transition, engineering corrective actions, support of the MQ-1C (ER), and the conversion of the 30 LRIP TSP systems. 

The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Beyond Block 1 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). 

Improved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget15(PB15) to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE). TSP is scheduled for integration and testing on the IGE platform upon completion of the platform's Follow on Test Evaluation#2 scheduled 1QFY18.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/System Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).

Continued integration of Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) into the Modeling &amp; Simulation domain as it pertains to UAS simulation.  Terrain, and model development for NVIG and Virtual Reality Scene Generator (VRSG) to increase fidelity.  Support of theater level Exercises, Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG), Yama Sakura (YS) and Key Resolve (KR).  Improvement of mapping capability for mission planning.  Redesign of Windows Entity Server (WES) and NetLink to improve network routing, thus lessening bandwidth consumption.  Incorporation of Common Image Generator Interface to provide an Image Generator (IG) agnostic solution thereby allowing for other IGs to be supported that are currently not supported.  Continued implementation of tactical protocols into the simulation domain to enhance interoperability.  Development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater.  Redesign of generic 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) application that will allow for creation of new platforms without touching code; again a reduction in costs and increased solution delivery speed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The EMARSS RDTE efforts are found in the following two project lines; 0305206AEH2 EMARSS ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH3 EMARSS Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02112 and AZ2054. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy, supported by the EMARSS CPD, is to design and test 24 systems as well as provide enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar; line-of-site (LOS) and beyond line-of-site (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. The EMARSS fleet of 24 systems will consist of the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The EMARSS RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH2 EMARSS ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH3 EMARSS Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02112 and AZ2054. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy. EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four EMARSS-S (SIGINT). 

This funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funding in the amount of $6.531 million provides LiDAR Sensor Development and Mission Equipment Packages (MEP) and PED Sensor Engineering Support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Base funding of $1.980 million continues the lab and flight test for Signal 3 and 4 software to see if it meets the requirements in the ARL-E CPD.
.
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 OCO funding of $14.000 million continues the new signal enhancement development effort for Signal 3 and 4 to develop software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Airborne Reconnaissance Low- Enhanced (ARL-E) RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH4 ARL ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH5 ARL Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02110 and AZ2050. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E CPD requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), EO/IR FMV, COMINT, on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through DCGS-A Enabled workstations. The development and testing of LRR is required to replace the current ARL Phoenix Eye Radar to increase performance and meet the improved requirements of the Appendix J Payload for the approved ARL-E CPD. The remainder will fund software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities. The software will be added to existing COMINT systems to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a RC-12X fixed-wing aircraft, which hosts Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) sensors. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify/identify critical targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army's AISR 2020 strategy, the Army's Acquisition Objective/Army's Procurement Objective (AAO/APO) is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd MI BN; seven (7) fielded to the 204th MI BN, and five (5) pilot trainers to support Force Generation. The five (5) trainers  are not equipped with Primary Mission Equipment (PME).

This funding line supports JICD 4.2 Compliance (ONS 22419).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Distributed Common Ground Systems - Army (DCGS-A) was formerly designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration. The core functions of DCGS-A are: the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities. DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE). DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As new software capability drops are integrated and tested, a continuing series of modifications will be integrated and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.  This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY 2019 fielding.

DCGS-A software is tailored by echelon and scalable to each unit's mission. DCGS-A provides commanders and staffs the ability to maintain an accurate and up to date understanding of the operational environment. The DCGS-A contribution to commanders' visualization and situational awareness, rapid planning, and the synchronization of all warfighting functions, enable Army units to operate within the enemy's decision cycle. This capability enhances tactical and operational maneuver and the conduct of full spectrum operations across the range of military operations from Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) to major combat operations and campaigns through all phases of the Joint Continuum of Military Operations.

The DCGS-A configurations range from laptops to systems integrated in tactical shelters and mounted on tactical vehicles to large commodity servers operating in a sanctuary based data center processing environments. The fundamental intent and tenet of this approach is to reduce forward deployed equipment/footprint by co-locating the advanced analytics capabilities within the DCGS-A baseline with the regional data centers, where the data is stored. This infrastructure consolidation simultaneously reduces processor and communications requirements in tactical units by limiting the number of large data files transported across tactical communications systems. Following a successful operational assessment and Milestone C in 2QFY12/Full Deployment Decision in 1QFY13, Follow-on Test &amp; Evaluation in 3QFY15, the program is deploying DCGS-A Increment 1 Software Baseline throughout the Army.

FY 2019 has no funding for Project 956.

FY 2019 Base funding in the amount of $38.667 million for D07, DCGS-A, will be used for modification, testing and integration of commercially available technologies to support multi-source intelligence processing at the tactical levels, as directed in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NOAA), Section 113 and Section 220 that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing iterative software updates required to remain current.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Note: The Distributed Common Ground System - Army is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-A is a former ACAT IAM, Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program. The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple capability drops structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army's operational needs.

The DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.

DCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon's intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.

The DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. As capability drop requirements are approved, DCGS-A will leverage commercially available solutions and non-developmental items to meet user needs. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD), version 8.7 was approved on 17 Jul 15.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle configuration.  ER is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 34 hours.  ER's extended range provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, and reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  The Gray Eagle Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) acquisition strategy emphasis will be to complete Developmental test events (Environmental, E3, Transportability, &amp; Performance Tests) to define and address system risks, followed by a FOTE II for the IGE.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides the battalion and below ground maneuver elements critical situational awareness and enhance force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Intelligence, Reconnaissance, Surveillance (IRS) capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

A FoSUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller, Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  FoSUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) option under consideration.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $6.180 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRM prototype solution for the FoSUAS effort. Options range from testing non developmental items produced by industry to researching what other government agencies have achieved in quad copter development and technology.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive tactical Intelligence, Reconnaissance, Surveillance (IRS) capability through the ability to view real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data via the system ground control stations.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

A FoSUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable hand controller, Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  FoSUAS is transitioning to a Capabilities Production Document (CPD) that will utilize existing RQ-11 and RQ-20 in a system of systems fielding concept, with a Short Range Micro (SRM) option under consideration.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $6.180 million will be utilized for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRM prototype solution for the FoSUAS effort. Options range from testing non developmental items produced by industry to researching what other government agencies have achieved in quad copter development and technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS) RQ-7 provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection.  In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the Combat Aviation Brigade's (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalion.  This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities.  The RQ-7B Shadow has logged over 1,090,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle.  Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF).  The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload.  All 104 systems required by the Army Procurement Objective (APO) have been procured.  In 2010 the Army G8 established an RQ-7B Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) MODs program.   

Justification:  Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 RQ-7B UAS Base funding of $12.863 million will be utilized in the following: 1) $10.696M will be used to continue modifications for the RQ-7B UAS, 2) $2.167M provides interoperability and enhancements for the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT). The $10.696M for modifications of the RQ-7B UAS will conduct an operational test on the Shadow v2 Block III upgrade, complete testing of the air vehicle modifications to allow operations in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment and Air Vehicle and Ground Equipment software development for interoperability and MUM-T.  The operational test for the Block III upgrade is required to assess the safety, suitability and effectiveness of the Block III upgrade prior to fielding.  The GPS denied development is a phased, multi-year effort. Phase I (FY16) provided a trade study to determine the best hardware and software alternatives. Phase II (FY16) initiated the design and development through preliminary design review. Phase III (FY17) completed design and development through critical design review and conducted engineering flight testing. Phase IV (FY18 &amp; FY19) will complete development, qualification, and developmental testing. RDTE also provides interoperability modifications that support MUM-T with the AH-64 Apache Helicopter, and Systems Engineering and Test and Evaluation to support the capability improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors.  The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS.  A successful Milestone II Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was conducted 21 Dec 1999 and a Milestone III Decision was reached on 25 Sep 2002.  The full rate production contract was awarded 27 Dec 2002 and in FY2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract.  Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2,  Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades.  Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on an engineering services contract with Shadow contractors.  Development of the Block III engine was accomplished through a competitive process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Program of Record for biometrics tactical collection capability is presently the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A).  It consists of the BAT-A Kit, BAT-A Handheld and BAT-A Web Service.  This capability supports the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system collects, matches, stores, and shares biometric and contextual information on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A system is also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police) for protection missions.   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability and has been deployed in a combat zone for over 17 years.  Today, BAT-A supports Operation Freedom's Sentinel, Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Guantanamo Bay.  The BAT-A system will reach end of useful life in FY22.

The $4.310 million of FY 2019 Base Funding will continue the transition phase established in FY 2018 for Next Generation Biometric Collection Capability (NXGBCC), the replacement for the BAT-A.  The program will use the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) process to down-select prototypes from commercial vendors.  Also, the program will begin NXGBCC infrastructure assessment, functionality and modality evaluation.    

The FY 2019 OCO of $2.214 million will continue to support the development of new software code &amp; associated testing to deliver the Identity Intelligence Analytic Resource (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) specifically to create the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and other worldwide missions) on the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE) Commercial Cloud Service (C2S) cloud.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NXGBCC Acquisition Strategy is to procure a limited development integrated solution that meets the NXGBCC collect/store/match/share requirements and interfaces with the Biometric Family of Systems.  The strategy will maximize mature technologies (integrated commercial off the shelf products) and reward industry for providing a solution that is integrated and can be fielded in FY21.  The program office will use an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to down-select a prototype from commercial vendors.  Upon OTA completion, the procurement, fielding and sustainment sustainment process will begin. 

The $2.214 million of FY 2019 OCO funding will continue the development of new software code &amp; associated testing necessary to deliver the Identity Intelligence Analytic Resource (I2AR).  The acquisition strategy will be to exercise a contract option which enables for continuation of a contractor to develop activities for the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved Quick Reaction Capability (QRC).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven Government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated network management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams to Company-level through FY2018. Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining situational awareness and mission command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30-Megabit per second aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that transmission paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or lose connectivity. This capability offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks. WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep mobile and dispersed forces networked through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network. The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

Inc 3 developed NetOps software and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into Inc 2 equipped units.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>FE1: Dscs-Dcs (Phase II):
This project provides funds to develop Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):
Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FE4 / Enroute Mission Command:  
Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:
Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.

Due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This effort finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and Risk Management Framework (RMF) support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which enhance decision support capabilities, allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into EWSTS and WSOMS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts, performed by MILSATCOM SE, lead to savings for the overall Army in the out years.

FY 2019 funds support the continued systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM Communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). In addition, FY 2019 funding covers the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) Modem Testing, Narrowband Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD), Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) Development and Testing, Network Centric Waveform - Resilient (NCW-R) engineering support and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructure in Dec 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability begins in FY18.

FY 2019 funding supports the Ka FISA Post Deployment Assessment (PDA) requirement which will validate the EMC capability for warfighters to conduct mission command utilizing the Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), Dependent Airborne Node (DAN) and Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN) on the C17 aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The continued procurement of the EMC full operational capability follows DoDI 5000.02, 7 Jan 2015, Enclosure 13, Rapid Fielding of Capabilities. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and project manager will tailor and streamline program strategy based on the required timelines to meet urgent need capability requirements. The Army Executive Agent signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 27 April 2015 delegating MDA to PEO C3T.  The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability (FOC). An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructure in Dec 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability begins in FY18.

FY 2019 funding (173142 FE4) supports the Ka FISA Post Deployment Assessment (PDA) requirement which will validate the EMC capability for warfighters to conduct mission command utilizing the Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), Dependent Airborne Node (DAN) and Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN) on the C17 aircraft.  

Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).  FOC is 35 C-17s, eight Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), and 24 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and a Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs. Program Office core employee labor costs have been moved from RDTE to OMA as part of an OSD auditability directive.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers Increased sensor capabilities to include, but not be limited to, GEO satellite Starer and additional Highly Elliptical Orbit data. Spiral 2 delivers increased sensor, communications, training, and exercise capabilities to include, but not be limited to, integration of the Missile Defense System Exerciser (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing in accordance with the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

JTAGS Block I system is a transportable information processing system, receiving and processing in-theater, direct down-linked data from Defense Support Program (DSP) and other Infrared (IR) satellites. JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is being used as an institutional trainer but is available as a deployable asset. JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. JTAGS funding was moved to a new PE as directed by OSD to track Space Programs. Program Office core employee labor costs have been moved from RDTE to OMA as part of an OSD auditability directive.

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  The P3I Improvements will upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and will improve warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. P3I Block II Phase 2 Spiral 1 delivers Increased sensor capabilities to include, but not be limited to, GEO satellite Starer and additional Highly Elliptical Orbit data. Spiral 2 delivers increased sensor, communications, training, and exercise capabilities to include, but not be limited to, integration of the Missile Defense System Exerciser (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing in accordance with the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2019-20).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

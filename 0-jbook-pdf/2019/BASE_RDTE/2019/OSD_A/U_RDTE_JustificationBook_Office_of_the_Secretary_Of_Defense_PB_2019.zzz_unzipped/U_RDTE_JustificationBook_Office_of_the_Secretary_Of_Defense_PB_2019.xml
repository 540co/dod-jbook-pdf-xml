            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supporting basic research provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.

The Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research Initiatives project code, P010, includes Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) and the Minerva Research Initiative.

SSBR supports oversight, policies, and initiatives to implement the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering's (USD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.

The Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation’s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>Hosted the inaugural Science, Technology, and Innovation Exchange (STIx) conference in August 2018.  This conference brought together DoD-funded researchers, including Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellows, National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellows, and Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Fellows, as well as university faculty researchers together with defense laboratory scientists and program managers from the Services and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  STIx showcased and connected the nation's brightest minds to communicate new ideas and share novel approaches to confronting old challenges facing the defense community.  Its Ted-like lightening talks were streamed online over two days and are posted on the web.

Planned and published a broad agency announcement for the Defense Enterprise Scientific Initiative (DESI) pilot program with assistance from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in August 2017.  DESI was funded through the FY 2017 plus-up.  The program aims to inspire the collaboration among universities and industries in fundamental research.

Executed the first competition for the I-Corps @ DoD Commercialization pilot program, and supported 6 teams established in FY 2016.  One team received follow-on private capital to commercialize their research and another received the most improved award from the National Science Foundation's I-Corps teaching team.  The second competition is currently underway and will fund up to 12 teams.

Selected ten laboratory scientists for the 2017 class of Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative (LUCI) Fellows.  The research topics included advanced manufacturing, robotics, data analytics, optics and novel engineering materials.  The awardees included NDSEG and SMART Fellowship recipients.  Organized the first review of the LUCI program in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory in September 2017.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) fosters and enhances the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to access high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the STEM Development Office, under the Defense Laboratories Office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  NDEP’s portfolio includes the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP), STEM Education and Outreach, and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

The SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,400 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,100 have completed their service to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.

STEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department’s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.

The DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Defense Education Program</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce needed by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas, and include:  Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,100 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 74 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.

Since FY 2005, approximately 2,400 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) program provides support in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools and large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer internship programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment, such as lasers and spectrometers, for enhancements to the basic research efforts.

•  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding by assisting the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>Developed a funding opportunity announcement for the establishment of a HBCU/MI Center of Excellence for STEM Scholars (modeled on the Hopps Scholars program and in furtherance of H.R. 114-139, accompanying H.R. 2685, FY 2016 DoD appropriations act, requiring DoD to address plans to expand STEM opportunities for underrepresented minorities).  Graduates are expected to pursue studies and research careers, including at DoD.

Facilitated HBCU/MI student involvement in STEM areas and possible research careers within the Department by placing 81 interns and 15 faculty fellows at DoD laboratories in summer 2017.  The interns/fellows gave presentations about their research experiences at an August 2017 Basic Research Office-sponsored event.

Worked with Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Rome, New York to provide summer 2017 research opportunities for students from HBCUs/MIs operating the Centers of Excellence for Autonomy, Cyber Security, and Research Data Analysis.  The results of these students’ summer research experiences were presented at a poster session at AFRL in August 2017.

Coordinated with the Navy Cyber Security Information Assurance Program Partnership to provide four internship/co-op opportunities for HBCU/MI students in information assurance/cyber security.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims to develop the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with statutory requirements (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and 5000.02, and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the Program Executive Officers (PEOs), thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>GP focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies in the area of GP systems.  The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up, cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow and Fast Cook Off threats.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians," and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) investments are focused on capability areas that have been validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  The four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three technology areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the fuze environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology project areas.  

Of these, there are five core-technology areas:
• Advanced Devices
• Optical Systems and Technology
• Information, Computation and Exploitation
• Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology
• Cyber Security, Science and Engineering

There are four emerging-technology initiatives:
• Advanced Materials and Processes
• Quantum System Sciences
• Biomedical Sciences and Technology
• Autonomous Systems

There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. 

These ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence:
• The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Research in computing-intensive algorithms as well as more capable focal plane arrays will demonstrate higher resolution images. Until now, a laser radar on a large aircraft produced three-dimensional (3D) images only after hours of processing on the ground. Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution. Research with simultaneous microwave beams and optical beacons will explore techniques to overcome synchronization and coherent combining difficulties. The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare. So, development of multi-wavelength imaging spectrometers, long-wavelength infrared laser radars, and wavelength-agile short pulse lasers will provide continued capability growth while ensuring that deployed countermeasures in overused optical regions will not thwart DoD capabilities.</r2:Text>

These advances are a requirement for quantum computers. FY 2018 plans also include design of a fieldable, high-precision vector magnetometer based on advances in quantum magnetometry. This project area will also investigate electric field measurements that are based on the same physics and that employ much the same hardware as used for the magnetometer.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Research will place an emphasis on approaches to do quantum state transfer between a trapped ion and photon and leverage the ions for quantum sensing and quantum clocks. A linchpin for both quantum networks and quantum computers is the ability to manipulate robust quantum memories. Advances in quantum memories will build on the improved control and measurement techniques of FY 2018. Improved measurements based on sub-shot noise interferometry using entangled states will enhance microwave links over optical fiber, which has important applications for remoting of antennas. FY 2019 plans also include scaling quantum computer prototypes and investigating improved control and error correction mechanisms, as well as developing increased bandwidth quantum networking capability.</r2:Text>

Research into multimaterial fibers showed in FY 2017 unique long-wavelength properties. When woven into cloth in FY 2018, the cloth should make soldiers significantly less visible to heat-sensing cameras. This project area recently developed materials with large optical property changes in sub-millisecond times. Lincoln Laboratory continues to FY 2018, we will develop prototypes to improve this capability. Further work in FY 2018 will apply these materials to DoD and IC applications.

One effort is developing an integrate Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability at the tactical edge, by using cloud computing and robust, hierarchical communications technology. This project is designing a Cloud architecture for PED, which would be available at forward-deployed bases.  Another project is an Autonomous and Reconfigurable Maritime Networking Demonstration. This project builds on a recent underwater communication demonstration from the Optical Systems and Technology area. In FY 2017, active pointing and tracking of the terminals technology is being for adaptive communications between moving undersea objects.  The third effort is focused on risk reduction research and architectural design for a 3D imaging laser radar system to be deployed on a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite.

Research into novel approaches for computer hardware/software design will guide the design and development of a fundamentally new computing system that is inherently secure and can ensure mission success even when compromised. This effort will be complemented by developing a data-centric approach to ensuring self-protection of data throughout storage, computation and transit. Research into cyber resilient approaches for mission assurance includes the development and implementation of a secure processing engine for autonomous systems, and the development and validation of an automated capability for contested environments where a host may be disabled or compromised. Other cyber efforts include further developing the capability to automatically generate effective cyber courses of action for evolving threat environments such as damage by an attacker after network penetration, securing small satellites against the growing threat of cyber-attack, and securing the ability to compute on private data without revealing it and demonstrating this capability for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application.</r2:Text>

The program will identify outreach opportunities to inform and train DoD S&amp;T organizations in the usage of analytical tools and methodologies to support “in-house” decision making and expand organizational knowledge into emerging technology areas of strategic interest.
• Technical Assessment Program: ($0.5M) will sponsor multiple technical assessment activities that support the community of interest topic areas and more emphasis will be placed on conducting impact assessments of emerging technologies. These assessments will inform the S&amp;T community on direction for future capabilities to support joint and cross domain missions. 
• Intel Support to S&amp;T: ($1.0M) will provide a bridge between the intelligence community (IC) and the S&amp;T community to access the most relevant intelligence analysis, coordinate integration of intelligence with capability development, and conduct Red Cell assessments to inform technology investment shaping and strategic direction. An additional function will be to produce an annual S&amp;T Intelligence Needs Plan providing the IC a formal understanding of intelligence requirements for the R&amp;D community.

                                        <r2:Text>In FY 2019, the Technical Intelligence program will continue to support efforts characterizing today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel TW/HS tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future, and developing tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations of emerging and disruptive technologies. Specifically: 
• TW/HS Tool Exploitation: ($4.7M – Additional Data sources) will continue to support the operational TW/HS toolkit, TechSight, which is available to DoD researchers and scientists, and focus on developing data analytics on the commercial sector through analyzing venture capital, private equity and commercial investments in R&amp;D.  
• Technical Assessment Program: ($0.5M) will sponsor multiple technical assessment activities that support the community of interest topic areas and more emphasis will be placed on conducting impact assessments of emerging technologies. These assessments will inform the S&amp;T community on direction for future capabilities to support joint and cross domain missions. 
• Intel Support to S&amp;T: ($1.0M) will provide a bridge between the intelligence community (IC) and the S&amp;T community to access the most relevant intelligence analysis, coordinate integration of intelligence with capability development, and conduct Red Cell assessments to inform technology investment shaping and strategic direction. An additional function will be to produce an annual S&amp;T Intelligence Needs Plan providing the IC a formal understanding of intelligence requirements for the R&amp;D community. 
• Wargaming: ($0.5M) will integrate emerging threats from kill chain analysis and potentially disruptive technologies from horizon scanning efforts through the DoD wargaming community to better understand the potential of emerging technologies to better inform both the DoD requirements process and the technical capability development process.</r2:Text>

Conclude Seedling projects initiated in FY 2017, and select a new set of Seedling projects to address gaps identified by the CoIs. Concluding Seedling Projects are:

Preparing for Enhanced Energetic Materials: An affordable CL-20: The singular solution to range and energy challenges is to make both propellant formulations (for range) and explosive formulations (for energy) using the most powerful, mature energetic crystal, CL-20. Current use of CL-20 is extremely limited because of its cost of large-scale manufacture ($1,000/lb). The proposed work intends to achieve new, cheaper, high-yield, production routes to CL-20.
- Research CL-20 production with fewer organic synthesis reactions, thereby reducing production costs; these reactions will employ commercially available metal catalysts, instead of the current expensive Palladium catalyst required.
- Pursue the CL-20 precursor known as TetraAcetylDiAminohexaazaisowurtzitane (TADA), utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) starting materials.
- Work on small-scale mixing of CL-20 propellant formulations to achieve reasonable viscosity, pot life, mechanical and safety properties.

Development of Prototype Soft Epidermal Biosystems with Advanced Sensing Capabilities for Warfighters in Triage Settings: To develop a wireless epidermal system that integrates flexible electronics and a range of biosensors to provide rapid vital sign screening solution for battlefield triage of combat casualties. 
- Development of stretchable circuit and biosensor designs.
- Integration of soft elastomeric substrates and fluidic channel.
- Validation of porcine animal model and test conditions for future evaluation of novel epidermal biosystems.
- Evaluation of epidermal biosystems in porcine animal models and clinical settings.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States military forces require resilient and reliable networks, information, and weapons systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cybersecurity of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure the Department's missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cybersecurity and computer network operations to:  develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors’ cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cybersecurity, and explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.

This program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command needs and requirements.  More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cyber Applied Research program was initiated in FY 2011 to address specific technical problems that were not being fully addressed by the Services’ and the National Security Agency's existing Cyber science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.  Recently, S&amp;T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity, and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  Over the past several years, the program expanded research in cyber capabilities to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness, cyber command-and-control, cyber operations, and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.  From FY 2011 to FY 2017, the program explored a number of technical thrusts that included:

• Foundations of Trust:  Developing known degrees of assurance that devices, networks, and cyber-dependent functions perform as expected, despite attack or error.  

• Resilient Infrastructure:  Exploring technologies that not only withstand, but react to cyber attacks, and sustain or recover critical functions. 

• Assuring Effective Missions:  Developing technologies that assess and control the cyber situation in mission context while staging, conducting, and monitoring cyber responses.

• Cyber Modeling, Simulation &amp; Experimentation:  Simulating environments in which the Department operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of the cyber technology development. 

• Embedded, Mobile &amp; Tactical Environments:  Exploring cyber systems that rely on technologies beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.

As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&amp;T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Department reviewed the emerging needs of the joint operational community, new cyber threats, and the evolution DoD technology needs to focus the program on the changing cyber environment and missions.  To bolster this program and address future threats, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD’s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Seedling projects under the new research areas were initiated in late FY 2017.  Judiciously investigating aspects of this research in thrusts areas identified below will provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: 

• Behavioral Cyber Sciences:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  

• Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the recent advances in artificial intelligence research. 

• Foundations of precision cyber operations:  Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.

• Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security:  Advancing mathematical foundations of cyber S&amp;T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.

Advances in these new cyber S&amp;T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This technical area encompassed all aspects of the assessment, establishment, propagation, maintenance, and composition of trust relationships between devices, networks, and people.  Achieving a trustworthy cyberspace was a critical challenge as corporations, agencies, national infrastructure, and individuals have been victims of cyber-attacks, which exploit weaknesses in technical infrastructures as well as in human behavior.  This effort built upon long term foundational basic research in algorithms, models, probability theory, reliability, statistical theory and analysis, system structures, and secure computing, developing and enabling trustworthy cyber systems.

Research in algorithms helped develop methods to manipulate automated image processing computation using Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs), accelerating graphics processing unit (GPU) analysis.  The development and compilation of GPU tools into a library provided meta-learning capabilities that were used to improve trust in digital electronics.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Resilient Infrastructure entailed the ability to withstand cyber attacks and to sustain or recover critical functions.  This provided the ability to continue to perform functions and provided services at required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area was to develop integrated architectures that were optimized for their ability to absorb cyber shock and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state with well-defined performance characteristics.  Resilient algorithms and protocols increased the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research was needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resilient architectures.

Funded research under the Tactical Platform Cyber Resiliency project, developed techniques for furnishing resiliency on critical real-time control systems against cyber-attacks.  Through the enhancement of existing fault tolerance on physical systems, known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), combinations of artificial, manipulated crashes, and delayed input evolved a level of tolerance to enforce resilience.  The successful collaboration with Siemens transitioned the technology to the Naval Capability Program, Resilient Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical Security (RHIMES), which is now supports the NATO Sea Sparrow program.

Under the Network PUMP-II project, research explored the challenges of optimizing enterprise based data sharing requirements for the tactical war-fighter and intelligence missions.  The project developed a cost effective, high throughput government-off-the-shelf cross domain solutions that provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.  The technology is transitioning to the Naval Air Systems Command, Triton Unmanned Aircraft System Program Office.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Assuring Effective Missions presented technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Within this thrust, research was developed to assess and control the cyber situation within a military mission context.  Cyber Mission Control covered the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal by developing tools and techniques that enabled models of cyber operational behaviors (cyber and kinetic) to determine the correct course of action in the cyber domain.  Effects at Scale encompassed full spectrum challenges that intersected with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.

Funded research under the Mission Assurance Research Collaboration (MARC), a U.S.-Australia cyber effort to enhance mission assurance through data enrichment, deep learning and natural language processing.  The research developed dynamic mission mapping capabilities that were later integrated into Talisman Sabre 2017 (TS17).  As a result, the MARC team successfully captured ~12 terabytes (TB) of operationally relevant, shareable data that it will use to analyze for future research.  This massive data set represents a huge asset to the future of this five-year collaboration.  Additionally, the team established relationships with I-CORPS and  Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) as the network providers for the exercise, laying the groundwork for capability demonstration, test, and evaluation in future exercises.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Cyber Modeling, Simulation &amp; Experimentation (MSE)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Developed modeling and simulation capabilities that were able to sufficiently simulate the cyber environment in which the DoD operates and enables a more robust assessment and validation of cyber technology development.  There were two technical challenges associated with cyber MSE:  1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation, and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation sought to develop tools and techniques that enabled analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement developed cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area explored new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, applying the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research could be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies enabled the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that drove innovation in research.  Additionally, these methodologies aided in integrating experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.

Funded research under the Metrics, Instrumentation and Emulation for Cyberspace Operations, Electronic Warfare (EW) and Communications/Networking project developed a selected set of vignettes and scenarios to understand the complex interactions between red and blue networks.  The metrics derived from analyzing these scenarios were used to better inform future design choices in cyberspace, EW, and communications systems.  The dynamic scenarios developed under this research are being migrated into to a distributed test-bed to support development of analytical tools.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Increased the focus of cyber S&amp;T on DoD cyber systems that relied on technology beyond wired networking and standard computing platforms.  The objective in the area of embedded and tactical systems was to develop tools and techniques that assured the secure operation of microprocessors within our weapons systems and platforms; enabled security in real-time systems; and established security in disadvantaged, intermittent, and low-bandwidth environments.  This research also sought to expand and cultivate military-grade techniques for securing and operating enterprise commodity mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and their associated infrastructures.  With the constant evolution of these devices and their respective infrastructures it was of the utmost importance to provide a secure environment where these devices could be effectively utilized, monitored and tracked.

The Resilient and Assured Unmanned Aerial Systems Operations (RAUSO) project developed technologies to harden unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms and provided better cyber awareness to operators through the integration of a number of cyber tools and capabilities.  The approach leveraged a high-assurance hardware platform developed under the Assured Resilient Embedded Systems (ARES) program, to build a cyber security module software stack capable of monitoring sensor inputs and process behavior, while responding with security-relevant actions. The technology has been incorporated into the ARES platform and is being considered for a General Electric (GE) Aviation flight control system, with possible flight tests in FY 2018.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The point where hardware, software, and humans interact has become a jumping off point for a new area of research – behavioral cyber science.  Cyber operations should be seen in the context of a larger socio-behavioral-technical domain.  Research in behavioral cyber science seeks to advance the understanding and technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities and to discover ways to inject this understanding into the human aspects of cyber operations, cyber defense systems, planning, and training.  Future research must broaden the scope beyond the impacts of cyber actions on equipment, and also include the impact that these cyber actions will have on broader human behavior.  Just as an adversary’s behavior may be better understood using behavioral cyber science, behavioral science can be utilized to help understand ways to improve the actions of cyber defenders and the performance of the cyber workforce.  Data gleaned from observing effects of various cyber operations on users’ productivity, performance, and security will help the cyber workforce design better techniques and processes for use in cyber defense.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The pervasive nature of software-reliant systems in today’s modern military creates new opportunities for sophisticated adversaries.  The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  The Department can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against the adversary.  The DoD needs systems that will autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, be able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing actions, if necessary.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>When compared to traditional methods of kinetic warfare, cyber conflict is still relatively new and untested.  Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their target prior to completing an action.  The lack of a complete picture makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. In this type of uncertain environment, military leaders may be acting with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities.  Improved technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects, estimating their cost and effectiveness, predicting consequences, and ensuring precise effects will help both to limit collateral damage and to ensure that a chosen action has the intended effect upon the adversary.  Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>AAW focuses on the development and demonstration of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies for improving Insensitive Munitions (IM) of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary, but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of AAW munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application. The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the AAW MATGs are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact and Slow Cook-off, threats for larger and Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Develop high reliability fuzing architectures, fuzing components, and unexploded ordnance (UXO) reduction features.  This program’s fuzing technologies are critical to enable the next generation of cluster munitions to achieve the required greater than 99 percent reliability.  Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S. Defense and interagency users, as well as international partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation. CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users. 
CTTS major area of emphasis during FY18 and FY19 will be projects to Counter-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.
Specific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY18 and FY19 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-sUAVs, improving digital operations at the tactical level, increasing lethality of small weapons and ammunition, and addressing threats to commercial aviation.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. 
The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program Element (PE) focuses on Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) and Proof of Principle prototypes derived from evaluation of foreign equipment that will provide the U.S. Armed Services, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and Defense agencies capabilities to counter emerging threats. FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD), Multi-Service and Combatant Command (CCMD) priority requirements. FCT also increases competition, ensuring our personnel have access to the best technology available.

Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) efficiencies are included.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FCT program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment developed by allied nations and coalition partners to counter emerging threats, thereby enhancing U.S. warfighting capabilities while lowering U.S. development costs and accelerating the DoD acquisition process. FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments. FCT enhances interoperability, facilitates international collaboration, increases competition, and enables more efficient and affordable transition of technologies into acquisition programs of record. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD(EC&amp;P)), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). FCT projects are sponsored by the Military Services and USSOCOM. Evaluation processes for project selection include a detailed review to confirm the proposed item addresses valid requirements and DoD priorities, a thorough market survey, and an emphasis on transitioning technologies into current or future programs of record.

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries. Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States. Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement. The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States. To date, companies from 34 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Integrate existing Norwegian Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and four-pod launcher onto a standard U.S. Army Palletized Load System flat rack and demonstrate NSM launch and engagement of an over-the-horizon maritime target. This Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) mounted system enables Army and Marine Corps forces to support joint force freedom of movement and action through the projection of power from land into the maritime domain. Currently, there is no mobile, land-based, over-the-horizon, anti-ship warfare capability. The goal of this project is to evaluate an asset that could fill this critical capability gap. In 4Q FY 2017, a contract was awarded to procure the launcher and missile system from the vendor.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This effort tests the capability of a multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to function as an additional navigation source to existing military Global Positioning System (GPS) solutions for U.S. Naval surface ships and airborne applications. This testing will provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of using these signals in a U.S. military environment. Differences in positioning and timing between the foreign GNSS receiver and the platform's principal military GPS receiver may indicate to the platform that it should select an alternate, non-satellite navigation source.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 32 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM) and insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

Each of the 32 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES from the DoD munitions laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities are intended to predict the complex phenomena across significant length (meso to continuum) and time (nano-seconds to minutes) scales.  The tools will provide coupled, multi-physics and chemistry modeling capabilities that are scalable to massively parallel architectures for solving diverse problems across the weapons systems’ research and development and acquisition communities.  Numeric tools are the foundation that makes possible the integration of mechanics, materials science, physics, and chemistry.  This focus area also includes an extensive experimental component consisting of:  1) phenomenological or “discovery” experiments that provide the physics basis for model development, 2) experiments directly coupled to model development and application, such as characterization, calibration, and validation experiments, or 3) the development of advanced test methods or device development.

                                <r2:Title>Energetic Materials (EM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects and improved lethality.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by recommendations of the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan (LRRDPP) and the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining and improving lethality, effects, and safety.  

In order to clearly establish overmatch, the Department is working to increase the range and speed of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  This thrust includes the development of hypersonic and hyper-velocity weapons.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and the ability to initiate weapons under extreme conditions.

TCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.

                                <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

-  Firing Systems Technology, comprising FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.

                                <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  Significant increases in warhead performance are directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength, high performance, and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

The specific projects in the warhead and penetration technology focus area for FY 2018 are:
-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
-  Dynamic behavior of concrete.
-  Integrated munitions modeling &amp; experimentation for penetration and MBX target coupling.
-  Modeling of strategic structures subject to ballistic impact or blast.
-  Concrete perforation and penetration modeling and experiments.
-  Explosive/metal interactions.
-  Structure, mechanical &amp; shock-loading response, and modeling of materials.

                                <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating, predicting, and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:
-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.
-  Physical/chemical reactive transport modeling of material/system aging and reliability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&amp;E)) and OUSD Acquisition and Sustainment with assessments and analysis to inform the strategic direction of research, development, and acquisition of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. 

The analysis process addresses the following Joint and Cross-Cutting missions: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) Development of Analytic Tools to help understand complex and longer term challenges. The Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). 

Typically, the ratios of resources applied to Operational and Technical Assessments, Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team, and development of Analytic Tools will be roughly 30/60/10 percent.  Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Combatant Commands.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Operational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2018-2038 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
- KCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DOD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace. 
- Developed and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.
- Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.
- Consolidate Technology focused roadmaps of US capability development and S&amp;T developmental strategic plans. 

Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD/DoE) laboratories.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department.  In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that will be a source of battlefield advantage, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation.  

Leveraging innovative technologies from commercial startup companies has the potential to rapidly address warfighter problem sets in areas where commercial innovation outstrips government investment in the same technology areas. Through a unique partnership with other government agencies, we gain access to and vetting of innovative technologies from commercial startup companies where much of the research and development (R&amp;D) funds are provided by the venture capital community.  Small DoD investments in these companies, often in partnership with other U.S. Government agencies, further leveraging the dollars spent, provides short work programs to adapt the commercial technologies for warfighter applications. The deliverables from the work program allow the warfighters to rapidly pilot technology and concepts, with the ability to fail early and cheaply, and provide the avenue to refine warfighter requirements and transition technology from successful pilots to traditional DoD activities for integration into broader R&amp;D efforts or acquisition programs of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program focuses on three main areas: 1) Core Datahub pilot program; 2) Expansion of the Datahub pilot program to address the issues in the rest of the DoD 4+1 problem sets; and 3) Further innovation across other warfighter problem sets. 

Core Datahub pilot program.  This effort focuses on maturing and demonstrating the automated processing of  space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability to aid the Combatant Commander and Component forces in defeating threats posed by nuclear-capable, mobile missile - a problem set often plagued by sparse data.  The approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT and other commercial data sources for automated country-wide anomaly and change detection - crucial element for enhancing  indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.

Expansion of the Datahub Pilot Program.  Following a successful demonstration of Datahub and its leverage of commercial data sources and automation in early 2017, the team was directed to expand Datahub to address applicable issues in the remainder of the DoD 4+1 problem sets.  Some of these problem sets may leverage similar technologies to the pilot program, with data coverage for different parts of the world and algorithms tuned for different targets of interest, while other problem sets may require completely different data, algorithms, and/or technologies.  Although FY 2017 funding was only 50% of what was expected, the team is executing preliminary efforts to execute the expansion when FY 2018 funds become fully available. 

Innovation for other warfighter problem sets:  Through the unique partnership in place for this effort, DoD is exposed to a wide variety of emerging commercial technologies which have potential applicability to a wide spectrum of DoD problem sets.  Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these evolving technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing DoD R&amp;D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots, and on traditional R&amp;D in technologies not well served by the commercial start-up companies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>To counter the United States’ historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensor systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, advanced Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states.

The rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and the myriad of new advanced Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can rapidly address these new threats in more cost-effective ways.

The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to significantly accelerate the development and transitioning of new EW and EW-Cyber capabilities.  To do this, the JEAT program explores, assesses, and validates a plethora of new technologies and approaches focusing specifically on technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services’ Research and Development (R&amp;D) programs or are being developed by the Services at rates that cannot not produce required capabilities in the needed timeframes to identify the most fruitful EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D opportunities for the Department.  To identify potential nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, the JEAT program also explores and assesses approaches that integrate and demonstrate off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  The JEAT program’s approaches have provided substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&amp;D efforts and in Programs of Record, and thus enable required military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible in traditional DoD approaches. 

JEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two Project Codes.

•	In Project 619, Joint Electronic Advanced Technology, (1) the Experimentation/Demonstration effort utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities, (2) the Advanced Technology Development/Verification effort explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways, and (3) the EW Collaboration and Planning effort ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision makers.

•	In Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation, (4) this effort explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance awareness and accelerate planning and decision making in essential EMS war fighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology project (Project 619) explores and assesses innovative technologies and approaches to rapidly mitigate advanced threats and demonstrate new overmatch technologies in ways not being explored by the Services.  Project 619’s three efforts, Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo), Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services’ Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost.  Expt/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military.  ATD/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities.  EW C&amp;P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination, and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber Research and Development (R&amp;D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. 

Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo):

Expt/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues.  The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest.  Modeled after Project 619’s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) threats.  Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform/multi-aperture, collaborative/coherent EW and multistatic passive/active sensing architectures.

Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V):

ATD/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Project 619’s ongoing ATD/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. 

EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P):

EW C&amp;P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD.  EW C&amp;P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To do this, EW C&amp;P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and battle management technologies.  EW C&amp;P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements.  EW C&amp;P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D research, development and acquisition efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Our next Expt/Demo venue will focus on assessing the performance of passive/active sensing architectures in a complex and congested environment.  As with VH and all earlier Project 619 experimentation venues, subsequent venues will be scoped to address the most pressing EMS threats and the selection of venue topics and the scoping of these efforts will involve the EW and Cyber Communities of Interest and Executive Committees (EXCOMs) to ensure maximum relevance and benefits to Departmental efforts.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program addresses Joint and Combatant Commands (CCMDs) warfighting needs through the execution and demonstration of prototypes within two to four years of the identification of a need.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) to affordably operationalize technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR) when appropriate.  Based on the results of the assessments, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are either “left behind” for additional assessments or operational use, transition to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory.

The key tenets of the program are in alignment with the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering USD(R&amp;E) guiding principles to: shape major technology investments within DoD, focus on joint and cross-cutting missions, prove new concepts of operation, inform and or validate requirements, leverage open systems architectures, and identify accelerated paths to acquisition.    

The JCTD program achieves this by engaging the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment, which often fall into the seams between the military Services and DoD agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs’ integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.

In FY 2017, the JCTD program successfully completed the MUA and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:
•	The JCTD Program has executed 113 JCTDs from FY 2006 to present.  The data shows a transition rate for the program of 81 percent with 52 percent of capabilities transitioning to a PoR, 25 percent to operational fielding, and 4 percent to General Services Administration (GSA) schedule.  The remaining 19 percent were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technology/capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats.  LCMD program execution has been structured using a building block approach; the FY 2015 step was a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD (EC&amp;P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability would augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.  Funding was allocated for participation in the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Low Cost Interceptor Study (LCIS) and risk reduction for key technologies, including the seeker and thrust vane subsystems, modeling and simulation of subsystem design capabilities, and limited prototyping for component flight boards and gimbals.  Results from the LCIS indicated there are more cost effective and viable options for a low cost interceptor.  Accordingly, DoD discontinued the LCMD program and saved the intellectual property and data package for future BMD development efforts.  The LCMD JCTD was closed out in late FY 2017.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  PIER will deliver a dynamic, agile, cost effective (non-military construction) expeditionary engineering solution to rapidly repair damaged or degraded ports to a minimum level of serviceability after an attack or natural disaster.  Agility is achieved through a smaller footprint, commercial off-the-shelf infusion, and quick reaction of theater-based repair assets (e.g., pre-packaged, pre-positioned).  The intent of PIER is to assure continued logistics resiliency and freedom for U.S. Forces to maneuver and conduct agile strategic sealift and logistics.  PIER will allow the Department of Defense to address the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facility, and policy (DOTMLPF+P) concerns about its ability to conduct rapid port damage repair.  The plan is to transition to the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Transportation Command in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Previously funded effort.  This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified CCMD Direct Support, (2) JCTD Pre-Transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness (SSA) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  HALO uses high altitude, low-cost balloons as communication relays in denied environments.  It accomplished this by using the ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency spectrum and techniques that allow non-attribution to the source of the UHF signals.  The advanced technology resides at the user terminals on the ground, which receive data from the balloon-platforms, and subsequently perform the processing and communication receiver functions that allow effective two-way communication in a contested environment.  HALO received partner funds from U.S. Air Force Air Combat Command and U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.  In FY 2017, HALO completed the development of the hardware and software payloads for the balloons.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing program of record (PoR).  The existing PoR can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.
-  Results of JCTD can be used to inform the research and engineering, acquisition, or requirements process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported:
-  Develop and demonstrate a prototype that fills a joint capability gap. 
-  Demonstrate a capability to address a DoD key strategic gap. 
-  Develop a prototype that informs the acquisition and requirements process. 
-  Independent Assessment Capability.
-  Successful military utility assessment (MUA).

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
• JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within 24-48 months: 
• The JCTD program will continue to achieve high transition rates.  In FY 2017, 50 percent of completed JCTDs successfully transitioned and exceeded the DoD Strategic Performance goal of 40 percent.  Two of six completed JCTDs transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record.  One transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  Three were returned to the technology base for further analysis and/or future use.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) will be adversely affected during operations in contested Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.
 
The DoD’s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a “leap ahead” of today’s capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.

The Future Autonomous Battlespace RF with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) (formerly referred to as Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM)) program will develop next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture will be flexible enough to support Commander’s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC’s efforts will focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam(AJ), Low Probability of Interference (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms; adaptive processing algorithms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit/receive/nulling); adaptive power control; Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques; self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing  resilient tactical data links, communications and networking “service level” capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.

Based on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC will verify the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitate the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521, the latter of which represents the Department’s comprehensive advanced manufacturing program focused on enabling the strategic goals of timely, affordable delivery of dominant technologies to the warfighter, and improving the acquisition and sustainment of defense products and systems across their life cycles.  Designing for manufacturability early in the development of defense-essential products and systems can yield dramatic and positive impacts for the Department’s operational and modernization missions. 
			
The DMS&amp;T component of the DoD ManTech program specifically focuses on the development of cross-cutting and potentially game-changing manufacturing technologies, processes and capabilities that are typically beyond the scope or risk of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform.These high-leverage, defense-wide investments are designed to benefit the performance, affordability, and delivery timelines/deployment cycles of many of the department’s most essential products and systems in ways that are not typically achievable through the efforts of a single service, agency or program office.
			
The DMS&amp;T program, therefore, is a unique and fundamental DoD ManTech Program component that is needed to optimize a coordinated manufacturing technology development process across the department broadly.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes and capabilities along with S&amp;T development enables the timely, affordable adoption and deployment of emerging technologies needed to maintain U.S. warfighting dominance.  Key DMS&amp;T technical areas for investment include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing, and respective technology focus areas addressed by each of the DoD-led manufacturing innovation institutes (discussed in the next paragraph).  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.

Manufacturing innovation institutes established by the DoD and part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program are also funded in this program element. Technical innovation and leadership in U.S. manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of industrial competitiveness to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. Eight DoD Manufacturing USA institutes have been established to serve as regional hubs accelerating technological innovation and associated production processes and educational/workforce competencies for military and commercial applications via shared public-private sectors.  These Manufacturing USA institutes, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, are generating significant industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and are forming new technology transition pathways via regional hubs spurring active collaboration among government, industry, and academia to help meet critical government and warfighter needs. The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T investment strategy follows a two-pronged approach built on: 1) broad technology initiatives  and 2) specific individual projects meeting more focused manufacturing technology needs.  Investments in both cases are built and managed in collaboration with the Department’s research, development and acquisition (RDA) communities (including active, ongoing coordination with the DoD ManTech Program’s Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel) and industry and target the development of defense-essential advanced manufacturing processes and associated workforce capabilities.  The portfolio includes a focus on above-the-shop-floor new manufacturing processes and practices having the potential to improve manufacturing efficiencies at broader, enterprise levels. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to more surgically apply investments to compelling and sometimes urgent manufacturing needs.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through funding opportunity announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP,and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Projects selected will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.

It is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access computer-aided design (CAD) for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.

Emerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.

Projects:
MTConnect Challenge Phase II (FY 2016): Promote academia’s educational development and implementation of production interactive solutions to the broad U.S industrial base with the expansion of MTConnect Challenge that contributes to reduced cycle times and the development of real-time production metrics for adaptable dashboard applications.

Securing American Manufacturing (SAM) (FY 2016): develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.
Cyber Security for the Shop Floor - Phase II (FY 2017-2018): The manufacturing factory floor is a growing area of concern for DoD cyber security because defense contractors throughout the DoD's supply chain are continually targeted by cyber criminals seeking to: 1) steal technical data, including critical national security information and valuable commercial intellectual property; 2) alter data, thereby affecting processes and products; and 3) impair or deny process control, thereby damaging or shutting down operations. Protecting the operational systems of a manufacturing enterprise presents a different set of challenges from protecting enterprise IT systems and networks.  This phase II project will develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic competitiveness to maintain technological advantage and global dominance for our military. To support these goals, Manufacturing USA institutes, each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, have been established by the Department to serve as national assests with headquarters and regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these Manufacturing USA institutes  will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the period defined by the respective cooperative agreement (CA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) between the federal government and the non-profit organization leading each institute consortium of members.  This CA/TIA period is typically for five years, with the flexibility to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., and to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes is intended to: 
1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems
2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&amp;D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods
3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness
4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment 
5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills
6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies typically from from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 through 7

The first and second year of each of these new institutes is devoted to establishing a sustainable business model and operations, with continued refinement throughout the full period of the cooperative agreement, including: expanding the institute’s membership base (as appropriate); establishing and solidifying revenue streams (e.g., funding from new R&amp;D activity, membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Council and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between Manufacturing USA institutes; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Additive manufacturing (i.e., “3D printing”) is a process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies such as traditional machining. Advanced additive manufacturing will benefit the DoD by enabling lifecycle cost savings and enhanced capabilities, including moving toward “focused logistics” – getting the right part in the right place in just the right time – for wartime and humanitarian missions using local supply chains. This Manufacturing USA institutes was established in 2012, with cooperative agreement funding included in this budget through FY 2015, and DoD program management costs included in subsequent fiscal years until all R&amp;D projects, reporting, and fiduciary responsibilities are completed.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Institute 7 - Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Manufacturing Innovation Institute (ATB-MII)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This institute is intended to advance state-of-the-art human tissue manufacturing innovations in cell and biomaterial processing, bioprinting, automation and non-destructive testing technologies. The motivation is to increase U.S. competitiveness in advanced tissue biofabrication manufacturing by encouraging insertion of disruptive technologies into multiple biotechnology sectors, streamlining integrated testing technologies and ultimately reducing the barrier to entry for new inventors. The goal is to establish a collaboration that will mature tissue-related technology across a range of manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) 4-7, enabling post-delivery assurance of tissue identity, viability, function, and efficacy. This Institute will bring together the diverse and currently fragmented collection of industry practices and institutional knowledge across many disciplines (cell biology, bioengineering, materials science, analytical chemistry, robotics, and quality assurance). Scaling up to commercial level production of tissues will require manufacturing and process automation suitable for living cells, as well as testing and preservation methods appropriate for tissue-based products with limited shelf-life and a narrow window of efficacy. 

Technical focus at a minimum will be comprised of four thrust areas: 1) Cell &amp; Material Selection &amp; Sourcing;  2) Biofabrication Platforms;  3) Process Design and Automation;  4) Tissue Finishing and Testing Technologies

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each Manufacturing Innovation Institute is established through a competitive selection process.  The executing military department or agency, in close and continuous coordination with OSD ManTech, publishes a formal solicitation (funding opportunity announcement) for proposals describing the scope of required activities and extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations (including universities) are eligible to bid, and each bidder forms a broad consortium of industry and academic partners. The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium.  The final terms of the cooperative agreement/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed.  Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessing the performance of the DoD-led manufacturing institutess, part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program, requires a multi-faceted view of ‘performance,’ given the program’s layered base of DoD, government-wide, and national level public-private stakeholders and interests. Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program’s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014.  Performance relative to both sets of goals/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance.  The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD’s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2)  at the DoD/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:
1.	Impact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem
2.	Financial Leverage/Sustainability
3.	Education and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development 
4.	Technical Advancement
Specific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute’s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) produces risk-reducing, conceptual and operational prototypes and conducts demonstrations of emerging technologies to support the priorities of the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  ECTD supports the USD(R&amp;E) with experimentation and longer-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains and enhances warfighter technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  The office collaborates with government labs, academia, and industry to execute projects that target specific mission capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Joint Staff, and senior leadership in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) efficiencies are included.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The ECTD funding supports projects that reduce technology risk of emerging capabilities by advancing conceptual and operational prototypes in support of near- and mid-term operational engagements and stability operations.  With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years through efforts that emphasize affordability, typically at a cost of less than $6.000 million.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies to accelerate capabilities to the joint warfighter, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capabilities; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction capabilities; and, dismounted soldier systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman’s Gap Assessment, USD(R&amp;E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).

In anticipation of a heightened emphasis by the new USD(R&amp;E) on outpacing threats and seizing technical opportunities, ECTD is structured to mature emerging technologies and highlight their military capabilities through joint demonstrations and ECTD sponsored venues for defense-wide experiments and demonstrations.  These include Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Together, these events enable newly-developed capabilities to be showcased in realistic environments with operational user involvement.  The ECTD program supports red teaming efforts to identify vulnerabilities in emerging technologies early, ensuring follow-on systems are resilient to adversaries.

In response to changing Department of Defense priorities, two new project lines are being added to the ECTD PE.  The high energy laser (HEL) project will begin development work to integrate a HEL onboard an AC130 aircraft.  This will enhance special operations forces’ ability to provide precision fires.  The red teaming project line will assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies.  This will enable the new Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering to make informed decisions on building new capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

DoD communication and sensing capabilities are increasingly compromised by congestion and spectrum loss, as is evidenced by the recent radio frequency (RF) spectrum auction and the spectrum relocation fund.  In other operational environments, emergent electronic warfare (EW) threats, technologies, and tactics contest the use of the RF spectrum and erode U.S. capabilities in ways that are difficult to predict and counteract.  This focus area helps address the dual challenges of anti-access and area denial though improved spectrum agility, allowing our forces to operate when and where they are needed.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Red Teaming project helps assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and systems with high payoff potential to address current technology shortfalls or future capability gaps.  The program supports field demonstrations and red-teaming to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle.  This project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats.  It informs requirements and helps accelerate acquisition pathways for joint missions.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, academia, and industry to develop a construct that current or future systems can be gamed against in a distributed, operationally-relevant environment employing traditional and non-traditional players.  Deliverables will inform technology acquisition and new concept of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The project funds red teaming and wargaming efforts to explore new capabilities in a competitive environment.  Projects will explore unconventional approaches to counter DoD technologies through red teams, wargames, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.  Efforts range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants including warfighters, scientists, engineers, students, and academics.  Deliverables include recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new concepts of operations.</r2:Description>

SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&amp;L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   

Typical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. 
The  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats / missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) describes the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative. This program was originally established in the 1990s in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code §2249d). Organizationally, this PE reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)). 

This PE provides policy oversight for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser–based simulations) and supports associated innovation, modernization, and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This work largely focuses on distributed learning interoperability (i.e., ensuring interagency technical and organizational systems function together) and helping agencies acquire new distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiency. Ultimately, this PE’s work promotes personnel readiness, helping the right people to receive the right training and education, at the right time—at the right cost. 

This PE’s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The “modernization” work involves Advanced Technology Development (6.3) in technical areas such as e-learning, mobile learning, learner modeling and analytics, and software interoperability. These efforts inform the PE’s “documentation” work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents, such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (“Distributed Learning”) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, the documentation work drives “coordination” efforts, which consist of implementation support and interagency/interorganizational coordination. 

This PE’s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group of military personnel and DoD/federal civilians (at the O-6 and GS-15 level) who represent their agencies’ distributed learning equities and are key stakeholders in shaping the direction of these agencies. These requirements are aligned to DoD/federal strategic direction, such as the Army Learning Concept for Training and Education for 2020–2040 (TP 525-8-2), Navy’s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan, and they are considered against emerging industry trends and technologies. 

This PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and Coalition Partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and Coalition stakeholders acquire and implement emerging distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports the components’ training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program’s R&amp;D efforts improve efficiencies and reduce costs by reducing time spent in face-to-face instruction, allowing more time for practical application and repetition; increasing interoperability, which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content; and researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Total Learning Architecture – All of the U.S. Services, Joint Staff, and many other federal programs have released publications calling for a modern “learning ecosystem” comprised of interconnected learning opportunities, supported by technology, driven by data, and integrated with other talent management capabilities. This program is supporting its development by investigating the specifications and web-based digital services needed to make training and education technologies interoperable. In FY17, an early “Total Learning Architecture” prototype was tested with 75 Special Operators at Ft. Bragg. In FY18, this project will enter its second phase of development and will include additional empirical testing. 

Learning Data – In FY17, this program led a revision to DoD Instruction 1322.26, after extensive coordination with the Services and Joint Staff. The revised Instruction recommends the use of the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI), a technical specification that enables data exchange across training and education technologies. In FY18, this program will continue to refine the xAPI specification for semantic interoperability and will coordinate with stakeholders to deliver the implementation guidance, conformance testing tools, learning analytics, and data visualization capabilities they need to make most use of it. In FY18, this work is also expected to inform updates to DoD Instruction 1322.26’s fungible technical references.

Competencies and Credentialing – In FY17, this program investigated competency and credentialing management technologies, and it prototyped a web-based competency framework tool as part of the Total Learning Architecture demonstration. In FY18, this PE will continue its coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, and it will continue working with professional specifications and standards bodies in development of associated interoperability specifications to aid permeability across organizational boundaries. 

Personal Assistant for Learning – Adaptive learning tools promise to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of training and education, and these tools are critical parts of DoD’s modern “learning ecosystem” vision. This program examines the science and technology needed to design such capabilities, using open-architecture and open-source methods. In FY17, this PE successfully tested several frameworks, including a smartphone-based system with Defense Language students and a table-based e-book capability with Special Operators. In FY18, this program plans to work with other agencies to transition some of these capabilities into operational use, coordinate with professional specifications and standards bodies to author relevant technical guidelines, and to continue development of these emerging capabilities. 

Interagency and Interorganizational Coordination – In FY17, this program provided distributed learning modernization support to more than 40 defense agencies (e.g., The Army Distributed Learning Program, Naval Education and Training Command, Air Education and Training Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Joint Knowledge Online, Defense Acquisition University), more than 15 international partners (e.g., NATO, The Technical Cooperation Program, Partnership for Peace Consortium), and other federal agencies (e.g., National Park Service, Customs and Border Protection). In FY18, this program will continue to coordinate with these stakeholders and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government.</r2:Text>

Learning Data – Collaborate with operational defense training and education organizations to help them implement at-scale instances of prototype learning data interoperability specifications, learning analytics, and visualization capabilities. Ongoing efforts will also continue to inform the DoD Instruction 1322.26’s fungible technical references.

Competencies and Credentialing – Continue coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, with the associated technical guidance potentially informing DoD Instruction 1322.26’s fungible technical references, once they mature. 

Personal Assistant for Learning – Complete development cycles of tablet-based and web-based prototypes. Continue transition of mature specification into relevant technical guidelines, and continue to investigate emerging capabilities. 

Interagency and Interorganizational Coordination – Continue coordination with defense, federal, and international stakeholders, and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The primary objectives of this PE are to inform distributed learning modernization efforts, to develop associated policy and guidance documents, and to coordinate across distributed learning agencies to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government. 

MODERNIZATION: The modernization work consists of a collection of smaller technical efforts, each with project metrics that reflect their unique technical goals. Typical metrics include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged by other defense and federal agencies, the increase in the number of interoperable training and education digital systems, the impact of these efforts on defense/federal strategic planning, and downstream reductions in training and education portfolio costs. 

DOCUMENTATION: For the policy and documentation efforts, metrics include at-least annual update of published guidance, ensuring the documentation adheres to current technical/industry standards. The policy and documentation utility is also judged based upon its use, including both number of vendors adopting the policy and number of defense/federal acquisition efforts adhering to the guidance.

COORDINATION: For the interagency and interorganizational coordination efforts, performance is first measured based upon the number of agencies, international organizations, and professional groups directly supported. Success is measured based upon the number of requirements consolidated across defense and federal stakeholders, an increase in partnering between agencies for distributed learning resource sharing, and, ultimately, in improved return on investment for distributed learning efforts.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the January 2017 Defense Science Board Report, “Defense Research Enterprise Assessment,” software, autonomy, and cyber are today’s core challenges.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to ensure a competitive advantage.  

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management. 

The SEI Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomy, Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts experiments designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  QRSP efforts support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by leveraging commercial technologies and acting as an incubator for potentially game-changing capabilities.  This Program Element also supports the Department of Defense’s (DoD) strategy to address future threats in a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats, inform the requirements process, and help maintain DoD’s technical superiority, while fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  Funding in this Program Element enables the new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Chairman’s Gap Assessment, USD(R&amp;E) strategic guidance, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).    

The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; technical risk assessments through wargaming; and, autonomous systems.

The QRF objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these capabilities to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs.  QRF focus areas include anti-access and area denial, broad electronic warfare, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  
 
The RRF objectives are to develop proof-of-concept prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative and affordable concepts and technologies that meet time-sensitive operational needs as identified by CCMDs, military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable conceptual prototyping with agile technology insertion.  The program also leverages existing capabilities in our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      

The JRAC focus is on responding, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The SMA Cell's objective is to support CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  SMA products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) provides the Services, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies to rapidly develop and field-test promising new conceptual prototypes that can have immediate impact on time-sensitive operational needs.  QRF focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.

In FY 2018 and FY 2019, QRF will continue to identify and fund prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments respond to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities, including the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; novel human identification technologies; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies. 

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
•  Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech: This project successfully developed a speech triage capability to determine if and when there is speech in a captured radio frequency signal.  Once speech has been detected, the prototype can identify speakers, languages, and keywords in real time across multiple channels.  In 2017, this project transitioned to the Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290) for deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms.   
•  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization: This project developed new Link 16 improvements for increased anti-jam communication performance.  The project also designed a real-time processor that fits into existing radio circuit card slots to increase adoption of the new technology.  Details of this project are classified.  Robust Tactical Data Link Modernization transitioned to the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) radio program for integration into the Link 16 baseline system.
•  CyberPhantom: This project developed fully customizable cyber tools for open network exploitation.  The solution leveraged best practices of the cyber workforce and expanded cyber space capabilities with a unique blend of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software integrated with new customized tools.  Details are classified.  In January of 2017, CyberPhantom transitioned to a classified operation user.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Hardware/Software (HW/SW) Assurance and Integrity Analysis</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a trusted systems strategy including focusing efforts on mission assurance, comprehensive protection planning, industry standards, and advancing DoD's capability to identify and mitigate HW/SW vulnerabilities through science and technology (S&amp;T).  These HW/SW Assurance projects directly support all elements in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 937.  This program established the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) that federates hardware and software assurance expertise and capabilities throughout DoD and makes the capabilities directly available to programs.  

The JFAC provides tools, services, best practices, contract language, and other help to programs that detect, assess, prioritize, and mitigate mission critical vulnerabilities to malicious software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities.  The collaboration helps mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in both SW and HW and yields secure architecture and design patterns available to all DoD programs.  Trusted and Assured Microelectronics Program Elements 0604294D8Z BA4 and 0605294D8Z BA5 demonstrate these capabilities and augment the hardware assurance capabilities of the JFAC.</r2:Description>

These projects will employ current hardware coupled with custom chemistries, data analysis algorithms, databases, and information transmission pipelines to enable more comprehensive analysis of trace, degraded, and mixed DNA samples.  This comprehensive data analysis allows for correlating individual activities and histories; the ability to determine biogeographical ancestry; increasing confidence in assigning extended kinship identifications; and, greater accuracy in predicting phenotypic attributes such as facial characteristics, eye colors, or skin tones and variations.  This focus area also includes support for HTS databases that are designed to ingest large DNA data flows efficiently, use processing power for searching and analyzing big data, and employ big data analytics to make predictive assessments that would otherwise go unnoticed.  This focus area will encourage collaboration on biometrics and forensics projects within the DoD, and with interagency, industry, academia, and international partners where applicable.  This collaboration will help maximize shared investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) project accelerates the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects through operationally useful conceptual prototypes.  It achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase ‘speed to market’ by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.

In prior years, RRF supported the development of alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   

In FY 2018 and FY 2019, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the new Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering).  The RRF’s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies.  Typical RRF projects address these focus areas through a conceptual prototype within 6 to 18 months and for less than $1.000 million.  

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
•  Advanced File Carver: This project developed a completely new tool that allows the rapid extraction and recovery of files from large data stores such as hard drives.  The Advanced File Carver significantly increased the functionality available to users over comparable GOTS/COTS competitors while simultaneously increasing performance speed ten-fold.  Additionally, this tool provides capabilities previously unavailable, including the reconstruction of partially overwritten files, and the recovery of digital images whose headers were deleted.  As a GOTS solution, the Department of Defense (DoD) has made this technology available across the Department and to over 15 federal agencies.
•  Ingres Tactical WiFi: The airborne Ingres system uses active WiFi signals and advanced processing algorithms to provide an accurate geolocation of target devices in dense, electromagnetically congested, urban environments.  Ingres can identify WiFi transmitters, such as a target's phone or laptop, with better than ten meter accuracy from standoff distances.  Ingres is transitioning to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command to perform evaluations in operationally relevant environments.   
•  Aluminum Start System: This project developed an electric plasma start system for aluminum combustors to replace the standard hydrogen-oxygen pilot-flame ignition system.  Aluminum combustors are an effective alternative to fossil fuel engines that can use sea water instead of air for oxidizer; however, current systems require pressurized hydrogen and oxygen to initiate combustion.  The prototype microwave-powered steam-plasma torch eliminates hydrogen-oxygen start systems and their associated risk.  This effort transitioned to the U.S. Navy for follow-on development and integration into the aluminum combustion power system for large displacement unmanned underwater vehicles.
•  Bloom: Responding to an emerging operational need, Project Bloom developed a moored buoy capable of long duration surface measurement operations.  The system provides a platform for radio frequency (RF), magnetic, optical, radiological, and chemical sensing on a standardized and easy to deploy buoy.  The Bloom buoy includes an internal winch capable of submerging it for "sleep" periods and to avoid approaching craft.  The operational prototype was deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility and transitioned.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>This portfolio will complete and deliver three new capabilities in FY 2017.  The first capability will be a handheld, rapid, automatic explosive detector called ExploDisk.  This device will not only check for the presence of seven common explosives, its novel use of cellphone camera technology will mitigate human error in color determination; a common weakness with current technologies.  This capability can also support the identification of illegal drugs by using different disposable analysis ‘chips’.  The second capability is a novel DNA analysis protocol that will extend kinship analysis from the current limit of second generation (grandparents or siblings) to the fourth generation (great-great grandparents or cousins).  This capability is critical to support the identification of remains lost from World War II and Korea as their direct relations may die before the service members’ remains are located.  The final effort leverages FY 2016 funds to finish development and deliver an advanced file carving system.  This system will accelerate the extraction and categorization of files of interest from large data stores while simultaneously screening out useless junk files.  Depending on the file types, this carver will accelerate the process 25 percent to 80 percent over prior carving systems.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Title>Faster Short Tandem Repeat (FaSTR) Human Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Profiling System</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Previous rapid DNA analysis systems have relied on pneumatics and mechanical valves for microfluidic movement.  Current systems are comprised of bulky hardware and DNA analysis times greater than 60 minutes.  The FaSTR DNA instrument exploits centrifugally-driven microfluidics to eliminate mechanical valves and pressure-driven flow, and allows commercial-off-the-shelf electronics to facilitate sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction, and assessment.  This paradigm shift to microfluidic technology radically reduces the form factor, analysis time, and cost of the system.  The FaSTR project will produce the first truly portable, rapid DNA analysis instrument capable of generating DNA profiles from “sample in” to “answer out” in less than 30 minutes and provide a match probability of 1 in 55 billion people.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Biometrics and Forensics Science and Technology projects field prototypes to address emerging technology gaps that limit our ability to quickly and accurately identify anonymous individuals who threaten our physical and virtual assets.  The overall goal of these projects is to reduce future operational risk to warfighters.  New technologies demonstrated through this program will allow warfighters to identify bad actors or counter adversaries’ attempts to mitigate our technologies.  These projects leverage techniques such as conceptual prototyping, increased use of small businesses, and increased competition between vendors.  Biometrics and forensics projects will mature emerging technologies that support identity operations and forensic capabilities required by commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military activities.  These efforts encourage collaboration on biometrics and forensics projects within the DoD, and with interagency, industry, academia, and international partners where applicable.  This model will help maximize collaborative investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>ISR sensors are critical for providing asymmetric compensation against larger, near-peer adversaries.  However, ISR systems span a wide range of sensing modalities and generally produce very large data sets that are difficult to analyze.  Efforts in this focus area will increase speed to market for better sensors and tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  Projects include improved surveillance sensors; tools to facilitate analysis of large data sets; methods to harvest meaningful intelligence from open and classified sources; and, establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities.  RRF sponsored prototypes will facilitate integration of advanced ISR capabilities into new and existing systems.  These prototypes will help increase the effectiveness of ISR architectures and reduce the human analyst requirement to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This focus area will develop the enabling capabilities and key technologies required to advance and secure additive manufacturing technology to meet specific warfighter needs.  Additive manufacturing projects are those that use processes in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control to create functional three dimensional products.  Additive manufacturing allows for rapid prototyping and iterative innovation, removing barriers for technology insertion.  Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste, additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for maintaining a U.S. competitive advantage.  This focus area will leverage swiftly-developing commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop conceptual prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly improve supply chain efficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and by using rapid prototyping to reduce the time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Projects will also investigate security of additive manufacturing technologies and digital schematics.  Deliverables will inform enhancement decisions and concept of operations development.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The SMA Cell started a strategic analysis effort at the request of the United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  The effort evaluated strategic risks and identified knowledge gaps to provide an increased understanding of potential security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  USEUCOM subsequently asked SMA to apply the same methodology to identify emerging Russian threats and opportunities in Eurasia.  Building on these efforts, USSOCOM requested that the SMA cell assess how the U.S. Government can diagnose, identify, and assess indirect strategies, and develop response options against associated types of Gray Zone challenges.  SMA completed several actor and social media analyses including Virtual Think Tank Assessments (ViTTa) that provided summarized subject matter expert (SME) analyses to USSOCOM.  The assessing ‘Gray Zone’ support to USSOCOM concluded in FY 2017.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.

M&amp;S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges and ensuring technical superiority; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&amp;S, enhances the DoD M&amp;S Enterprise by (1) enabling joint and cross-cutting cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&amp;S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&amp;S.

The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) improves design agility and cost-effectiveness during analysis and development leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, and fielding of mission-effective and adaptable systems. Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that will integrate physics-based models and engineering tools across acquisition disciplines to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, iteratively optimize designs and improve architectures to reduce or eliminate sensitivity to adversary tactics and capability improvements, and adapt those designs over time. The goal is to provide new pathways to acquisition and achieve a vitally-needed transformation in the contribution of Defense systems engineering to design resilience and effectiveness across the systems lifecycle. These engineering improvements are essential to accelerate capability to the warfighter and address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.

ERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.   These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports transparency, inclusion and data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability. ERS provides the capability to fully explore and identify key performance parameters and inform the requirements process.  With ERS, DoD is buying down the risk of future systems by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD’s high-performance computing assets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to keep pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion. The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation, and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons. HSST continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope. Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The HAPCAT project continued to develop and demonstrate air delivery system (ADS) technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature through a nozzle up to Mach 7.5 conditions.  The project activities included the design and initial fabrication of the ADS and conceptual design of a full scale facility. 
  Efforts continued on the morphing ceramic nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities project which seeks to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Following validation testing conducted at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), efforts were made to begin the refurbishment of the nozzle for implementation into the HAPCAT facility.  
  Construction of the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) Tunnel II extension was completed and evaluated to verify extended run times. Such testing will enable the full development of complex flow features affecting vehicle performance, the determination of control surface responsiveness and effectiveness, and the evaluation of the performance of aerodynamic features. The improvements will help fill a critical test capability gap and support future hypersonic vehicle programs. Initial facility performance assessments of the extended tunnel demonstrated a three-fold increase in test run time.  The facility was successfully used by multiple customers who required the expanded capabilities in order to meet their test objectives.
  The HSST project continued development of a mid-pressure arc heater prototype.  The prototype replaced an existing Huels arc heater with a segmented heater, creating a test envelope approximately three times larger than the current envelope for aerothermal testing.  Validations runs were successfully completed confirming extended test run times of up to 30 minutes and a higher thermal load representative of that experienced by a hypersonic vehicle TPS. These efforts advanced progress toward the goal of improved T&amp;E of maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles. In a related effort, the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.   The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  
  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance. Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle. Experimental results acquired through the boundary layer transition effort will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition mechanisms.
  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the LENS facilities at CUBRC, enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility. The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities. The project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   
  HSST completed development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, oxygen/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of characterizing high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development. Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment. Development of an airborne version of the LIDAR continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system on a crewed aircraft in preparation for implementation on an uncrewed vehicle. 
  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft. 
  The fabrication, and installation of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Uncrewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration continued in preparation for support of flight testing.
  Measurements of thermal emissions from the surface of typical boost-glide vehicles in an impulse test facility were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different surface compositions and treatments and filter frequencies for thermal imaging. The completion of this project resulted in valuable insights gained for a boost-glide vehicle design; these insights will be useful for future testing in high-enthalpy (high-energy) facilities.   
  Advances were achieved in the development of M&amp;S tools. Verification and improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes continued, making use of the unique data sets obtained from HSST scramjet engine tests and boundary layer experiments.   A technical report was generated that summarizes the methodology for conducting boundary layer stability computations in support of acquisition programs, including shortfalls in current capabilities and recommended improvements for the toolsets available. This report was released to the hypersonic community and serves as a benchmark document for use in hypersonic programs.
  The HSST transient thermal analysis software effort transitioned to users in the hypersonic community to support ground testing and flight testing.  
  A force measurement system technology development completed for use in short-duration, high-enthalpy test facilities. Such technology will permit testing that elucidates real gas effects on hypersonic vehicles.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems as well as between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The SET project performed risk reduction on a networked data recorder and data transmission scheme in support of Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) networked telemetry projects.  The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event. This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur.  
  A non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne applications was demonstrated showing 10 gigabit Ethernet data speeds required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements. Once ruggedized, this technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter. SET matured technology to enable more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry transceiver.  Development continued on a multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.  Technology enabling the compression of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) data was further matured. 
  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was matured.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.    
  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule.</r2:Description>

This antenna technology will employ either mechanical or digital methods to point the telemetry link to a specific ground receive antenna. The pointing of the telemetry link will enable spectrum reuse through spatial diversity, enabling two test platforms to transmit test data within the same portion of RF spectrum.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Major thrusts included continuing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, warfighter physical and cognitive assessment under various workloads and mitigation of test range encroachments.  
  The AIST project completed development of advanced waveforms to mitigate wind turbine effects on DoD test ranges.  Development continued on a passive imaging technology to derive size, shape, mass, drag coefficients, velocity and vectors for individual fragments to quickly characterize the fragment characteristics and distribution in warhead testing.  
  Work completed on classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., various dolphin and whale species) found at undersea ranges and the automated processing and display of mammal detections.  The AIST project continued the development of: a system to measure and assess warfighter cognitive performance under realistic conditions during a T&amp;E event; a personnel tracking system using amplitude modulation (AM) band signals; and technology to evaluate back face deformation of body armor from a blunt trauma event.
  Work completed on a technology for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another in-water platform in real time.  This will improve safety during tests and allow for more controlled two-body T&amp;E events involving conventional sea platforms as well as autonomous underwater vehicles.  This technology transitioned to the U.S. Navy.
  The AIST project initiated an effort to develop a high fidelity model which takes into account the noisier acoustic properties of shallow water environments (120 feet to 900 feet) for littoral T&amp;E.  The model will support evaluation of undersea test range technologies (e.g., hydrophone arrays, new communication signals/modulations, transducers, and portable instrumentation.</r2:Description>

TSPI technologies will be further developed to support: data collection in GPS-denied environments with a focus toward data fusion from disparate sensors, TSPI on high dynamic systems such as missiles and projectiles, and Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA).
  Advanced sensor initiatives for non-intrusive applications will include multimodal transducers, and self-registering/self-calibrating sensors.  Sensing applications will include weapon system orientation, body armor blunt trauma evaluation, air launched stores separation, and weapon angle of incidence measurement at impact.  Advanced data transformation initiatives will develop technologies for adaptive computing, virtual/synthetic instrumentation, data compression, wireless on-board data transport and improved data storage density.  Other areas of investigation will include micro-miniaturization of electronic components for non-intrusive applications.  AIST will continue to investigate technologies for mitigating range environmental encroachment issues such as alternative energy interference with range tracking systems.  Additional efforts will include human performance measurement and assessment, specifically human interaction with unmanned systems and the evaluation of the interaction of the warfighter and weapons/equipment and interactions between individual warfighters in team-based holistic assessments.
  The AIST project will complete technologies to measure: fragment characteristics from warhead testing; TSPI using distinctive near-field patterns from AM signals; and mental effort of warfighters during test events.   AIST will demonstrate a capability for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another in-water platform in real time.  AIST will demonstrate automated processing and displaying of marine mammal locations on DoD sea ranges.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects. The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>DET continued efforts to measure HEL energy on small targets such as mortars. The effort is designing a recoverable mortar prototype to address Army and Navy requirements and an Air Force requirement for a missile-mounted target board.   
  Work completed on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based technology to characterize atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path in a maritime environment.  This technology enables real-time determination of the maritime atmospheric aerosol extinction profile from coastal land or a moving ship.  
  Development of non-intrusive dielectric voltage probes capable of measuring high voltage pulses and potentials completed.  This technology will support measurements during HPM engagements including testing of electrical static discharge weapons used for C-IED applications. 
    Efforts continued to mature a dense plasma focus technology to produce strategically relevant, ultra-short pulse neutron fluence levels for nuclear vulnerability testing.  This project successfully demonstrated neutron production.  These efforts were reducing risk for the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program Pulsed Neutron Environment project.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) and Software Intensive Systems (SIS) Test (C4T) project is pursuing technologies to emulate Net-Centric Military Operations in a System of Systems (SoS) test environment.  Likewise, C4T is developing technologies to analyze the increasing mass of structured and unstructured data generated by C4I and SIS testing.  The technologies are required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking, and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.  
  The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester’s ability to effectively conduct rapid analysis of “Big Data” and automated test reporting.  C4T advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL)laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The C4T project completed development of technologies to enable the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) to utilize remote methods of authentication and privilege management to distributed users.  Moreover, these technologies will support the use of TENA over a broad range of networks and provide a common interoperability test architecture.   C4T continued development of technologies in multiple areas of “Big Data” rapid analytics by focusing on facilitating Data-to-Decisions (D2D). These technologies contribute to knowledge management and analytics in support of near-real time semantic analysis of large structured and unstructured datasets and assist the analyst in making decisions during test events. These technologies are targeted for support of F-35 testing. 
  C4T continued to develop real-time automated multi-band infrared target segmentation technology using state-of-the-art neural network and deep learning based algorithms.
  Development continued on technologies to test MK-48 and MK-54 torpedoes.  These technologies will provide an acoustic propagation model, both narrow and broad band, of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance in various maritime tactical environments.  The model includes a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.  The model will incorporate autonomous evasion maneuvers of targeted submarines or surface ships. 
  The C4T project continued the development of technologies to provide a reliable, fast, and cost-effective approach that enables Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) testing of next generation weapon systems.  These technologies will enable live assets to sense and respond to stimulus without regard to whether the stimulus is real or synthetic.
  The C4T project initiated the development of technologies to optimize the deployment of test support networks, plan expeditionary tests, manage bandwidth and spectrum contention with a networked system under test, and provide Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) data during live tests. These technologies will address deficiencies in Operational Test (OT) for network-enabled technology.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS) support every domain of warfare.  They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system’s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

UAST collaborated with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation Working Group to ensure that UAST is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.
  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&amp;E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  UAST continued investments in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  UAST continued developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will also prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, range boundaries, and warning areas. UAST initiated an effort to develop a software tool that will enable testers to monitor the internal autonomous processing states of a system under test without interfering with its operations or requiring modification to the system’s software or hardware.  UAST initiated efforts to produce a comprehensive and actionable Strategic Autonomy T&amp;E Investment Plan by assessing autonomy test infrastructure gaps, and evaluating test technology maturity required to cover gaps.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) ability to use cyberspace for rapid communication and information sharing in support of operations is a critical enabler of DoD military missions.  Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will require advancement and maturation of nascent test technologies.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats and test environments, executing cyberspace tests, and performing cyberspace test analysis and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.  It contains the two projects described below:

P455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.

P456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>The Joint Operational Command and Control effort demonstrated the ability to pass operational energy information around the battlefield.  Initial results show the ability to manually capture some limited operational energy information and provided it to decision makers within 24 hours of data capture.  The team conducted a design update for the Asset Wireless Network (AWN) Common Communications Module, installed firmware updates and executed a contract with Penn State University for AWN support

Operational Energy Watson was able to demonstrate a minimum viable product centered on AF S&amp;T investment in Hypersonics and specifically in high-temperature materials.  OE Watson is developing a cognitive assistant that combines deep learning, quantitative analysis, and analytic wargames. Funding also allowed for adoption of a single knowledge management tool(SEMS2.0) re-purposing from SERDP/ESTCP to OECIF.  The tool has been adapted for OECIF and the FY18 call of proposals and selection is utilizing this new capability.

Space Solar Power team held the program kickoff, discussed the application for potential users, and defined metrics of success.  Initial focus is on current solar cell technology with additional investment in perovskites.

The Ultra High Density Hybrid Energy Storage Module effort (HD HESM) is a follow-on from P456.  The team initiated contracting through the Air Force Research Lab for a new High Density System, developed cross service System Requirements (Navy, Army and AF), and initiated platform analysis for HD HESM installation and operation.

OECIF continues to co-sponsor, with SERDP/ESTCP, emerging Waste-to-Energy Technology development.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>The basic mission of the OECIF is to fund innovation that will improve DoD operational effectiveness via targeted S&amp;T investments. As Defense-Wide funding, it incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovations to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition them to mature capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness in 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. In June 2017, Deputy Commander USSOCOM requested support for development of a DoD CWMD “User Defined Operational Picture” (UDOP) that can access and share relevant WMD intelligence and operational information with DoD mission partners (Combatant Commands, U.S. Government agencies, and key allies). The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies and modifying existing systems. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The CWMD Systems program also funds technology-enabled analytical cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which support Combatant Commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).

This project funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

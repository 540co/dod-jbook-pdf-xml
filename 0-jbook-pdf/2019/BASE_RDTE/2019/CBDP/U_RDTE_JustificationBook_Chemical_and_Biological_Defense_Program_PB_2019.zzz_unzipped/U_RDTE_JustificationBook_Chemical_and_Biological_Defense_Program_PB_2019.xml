            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advances fundamental knowledge and promotes theoretical and experimental research in life and physical sciences.

The projects within this BA reflect the research areas of Life Sciences (LF1) (e.g. microbiology, biochemistry, pathogenic mechanisms, cell and molecular biology, immunology, nanoscale science, and information science) which focus on fundamental efforts to understand living systems' response to biological or chemical agents, to support detection, diagnostics, protection, and medical treatment. 

The projects within this BA also include efforts in Physical Sciences (PS1) (e.g. chemistry, physics, materials science, nanotechnologies, nanoscale science, and environmental science) which focus on fundamental scientific phenomena.  These support investigation of physical and chemical properties and interactions for enhanced functionalities important to detection, diagnostics, protection, and decontamination.

BA1 also supports the DoD Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Strategic Plan to attract, inspire, and develop exceptional STEM talent across the education continuum to enrich our current and future DoD workforce to meet defense technological challenges.  This includes the Joint Science and Technology Institute (JSTI) which is a 2-week residential program for high school students and teachers who conduct a research project from a STEM field with a DoD scientist.  In addition, the National Research Council Research Associateship Program and the Military Internship Program provide unique opportunities for talented scientists and engineers, and promising midshipmen/cadets, to conduct research at DoD service laboratories on projects that are of interest to the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Enterprise in an effort to develop the future DoD workforce.

The projects in this PE are placed in BA1 because they are basic research efforts directed towards non-specific or non-unique military applications.  Basic research technological breakthroughs support applied research (PE 0602384BP) activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project (PS1) advances fundamental scientific knowledge in physical science areas that include chemistry, physics, materials science, environmental sciences, and nanotechnology that could potentially lead to transformational CB defensive capabilities enhancing Warfighter performance and safety.  Research results in physics, chemistry, and materials sciences that have potential application in point and standoff detection, diagnostics, as well as protection and decontamination.  Surface and environmental sciences focus on the study of physical and chemical properties and phenomena of interactions, especially with regard to Non Traditional Agents (NTAs), that seek to improve capabilities such as detection, protection, and decontamination.  Research in nanotechnology and nanoscale sciences, such as nanoelectromechanical systems, molecular motors, nano-mechanical resonance sensing, and nano-meter imaging, has potential application across CB capability areas to provide significant enhancement by, for example, decreasing detection response times, increasing medical countermeasure effectiveness against a wider array of threat agents, and providing currently unavailable modalities like detection imbedded in fabrics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Applied research in the areas of physical technologies (CB protective materials, textiles, and filtration, sensors and sensing algorithms, effects modeling, chemical formulations, processes, and methods for hazard mitigation), medical technologies (drug discovery and platform technology development, biomarkers and assay development useful in drug development and diagnostics, human mimicking devices and regulatory science), and non-traditional agent medical and physical defense technologies, including characterization of emerging threats.  Major efforts support development of vaccines, therapeutics, next generation diagnostics systems, next generation chemical detectors, nerve agent pretreatments, and individual protection advances.

In the physical sciences area, Project CB2, focuses on continuing improvements in CB defense materiel, including contamination avoidance, decontamination, and protection technologies, as well as biological weapon/agent surveillance.  

For Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs), Project NT2 consolidates all NTA efforts (both medical and non-medical) including pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, threat agent science, modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  

The medical program, Project TM2, focuses on the development of antidotes, drug treatments, disease surveillance and point-of-need diagnostic devices, patient decontamination and medical technologies management.

One function of the CBDP S&amp;T Applied Research budget is to preserve critical core competencies in the DoD Service laboratories which includes: United States Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others.  The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.

Efforts under this PE will transition to or will provide risk reduction for Advanced Technology Development (PE: 0603384BP), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (PE: 0603884BP), and System Development and Demonstration (PE: 0604384BP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Demonstrates technologies supporting transition to advanced component development.  This includes physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for biosurveillance in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.

In the physical sciences area, Project CB3 focuses on demonstrations of CB defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, information system technology for hazard prediction and systems performance, and protection, and decontamination.  The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents. 

All non-traditional agent (NTA)-dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in Project NT3.  This Project includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.

The medical program in Project TM3, aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents.  Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.  

Project TT3, Techbase Technology Transition, pursues efforts to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.

One function of the CBDP S&amp;T Advanced Technology Development budget is to preserve critical core competencies in the DoD Service laboratories which includes: United States Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others.  The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.

The PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP/PE 0604384BP activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project NT3 develops future capabilities against emerging and novel threats and verifies current capabilities against Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).  This project focuses on demonstrating fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.  Efforts in this project support an integrated approach to develop new or enhanced countermeasures against novel and emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination and medical countermeasures (MCMs).  Efforts supply test methodologies and supporting science to verify capabilities, develop protection and hazard mitigation options, expand hazard assessment tools, and develop MCMs against NTAs.  This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing NTA defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.  This project supports advanced technology development of NTA defense science and technology initiatives and transitions them to Budget Activities 4 and 5.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Innovative biotechnology approaches to advance medical systems designed to rapidly identify, diagnose, prevent, and treat disease due to exposure to biological threat agents will be evaluated.  In addition this project supports the advanced development of medical countermeasures to include prophylaxes, pretreatments, antidotes, skin decontaminants and therapeutic drugs against identified and emerging chemical warfare threat agents.  Entry of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic technologies into advanced development is facilitated by the development of technical data packages that support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) processes, DoD acquisition regulations, and the oversight of early phase clinical trials in accordance with FDA guidelines.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TT3 validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and a Joint Combat Developer concept development and experimentation process that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature technologies to advanced development programs requiring chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies.  These programs offer an opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies including limited objective experiments, laboratory experiments, risk reduction efforts, engineering and integration.  These demonstrations and programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness.  Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated.  Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full-scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development.  This project addresses four family of products areas: Biological Resiliency, to include Biosurveillance; Integrated Early Warning, to include Remote Detection; Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Destruction and Disablement; and Hazard Mitigation.  Biological resiliency efforts are targeted to reduce biological threats.  Integrated Early Warning is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering Chemical and Biological Detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators with rapid response actions.  WMD Disablement and Destruction addresses detection, identification, verification and baseline assessments in support of expeditionary forces deployed in non-permissive environments.  Hazard Mitigation addresses Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) remediation and decontamination processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Project TT3 validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies and concepts-of-operations through the use of the Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD), Rapid Military Utility Assessment (RMUA) processes and Demonstration Concept Development and Experimentation on initiative.  Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) are Chemical Biological Defense Program (CBDP) efforts designed to demonstrate the maturity and potential of advanced technologies across the Sense/Shape/Shield/Sustain spectrum for enhanced military operational capability or cost effectiveness.  The RMUA is a formal development and experimentation process with the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCOE) and the Joint Combat Developer that enables both material and non-material solutions through the identification and integration of innovative CB technologies.  These new capabilities are demonstrated via an agile, short-timeline (6-12 month) to enable transition of mature technologies to Advanced Component Development and Prototype programs.  The Demonstration Concept Development and Experimentation effort validates technology requirements and scopes future ATD programs with Warfighter stakeholders, including Combat Developers and Service representatives.  This project addresses enterprise priority areas of Early Warning and Integrated &amp; Layered Defense.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  This program element supports the Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) of medical and non-medical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) medical and non-medical CB Defense initiatives.  DoD missions for civil support operations have recently expanded and have resulted in providing focus to develop technologies to support CB counterterrorism initiatives.  ADC&amp;P is conducted for an array of chemical, biological, and toxin detection and warning systems providing early warning, collector concentrators, generic detection, improved reagents, and decontamination systems using solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated materiel without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  CB sensors and diagnostics enhance the Departments environmental and medical surveillance efforts by improving the monitoring and surveillance of threats and forces preparing for and engaged in military operations.  These efforts are required to enable military commanders and the Military Health System to prevent, treat, and mitigate threats to individual Service Members and military units.  Integration of CB sensor and diagnostic data from the programs in this ACD&amp;P will also be usable within the homeland security and Federal public health common operating pictures.  

The Department of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasizes prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this ACD&amp;P, such as vaccines against the most likely biological threat agents and traditional / non-traditional chemical agent prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfies the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this ACD&amp;P support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include improvements to CB diagnostics and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of chemical and biologic agents and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.  DoD is the only Federal activity conducting ACD&amp;P on these prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic CB medical countermeasures.

The Department of Defense coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The Department of Defense ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The DoD's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

ACD&amp;P also supports the development of updated test capabilities to evaluate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense systems.

The projects in this program element support efforts in the technology development phase of the acquisition cycle and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 4.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Contamination Avoidance Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports Component Advanced Development and System Integration (CAD/SI) of reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).  Individual efforts are: (1) CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotics Platforms (C-SIRP), (2) Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Integrated Early Warning (IEW), (3) Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS), (4) Manned Mounted Platform Radiological Detection System, (5) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA), (6) Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) (formerly NGCD 4), (7) Biosurveillance (BSV), (8) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets 2 (CBRN DRS 2), (9) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), transitions to Aerosol-Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) (formerly NGCD 1), Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2), Multiphase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3), and WCAD (formerly NGCD 4), and (10) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense. 

The CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotic Platforms (C-SIRP) is a new start in FY19 that will focus on modular CBRN sensor solutions to enhance Unmanned Air Systems (UAS)/Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) programs of record (PORs) with capabilities to provide situational awareness across multiple echelons of command in order to enable freedom of maneuver and action on the battlefield.  C-SIRP will emphasize integration of commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) CBRN sensors for identified unmanned platforms PORs within Program Executive Office Aviation (PEO-AVN) and Program Executive Office Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&amp;CSS).

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW) will integrate advanced technologies and currently fielded capabilities to provide equipment capability sets and situational understanding decision tools to protect against and mitigate CBRN effects when operating in a contaminated environment.  The Joint Force requires tactical, enhanced, and integrated Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, situational awareness, and hazard understanding early warning capability and decision tools to provide operational commanders time and space to mitigate Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) effects.  ECD IEW will demonstrate these capabilities by enabling Joint operators to locate, track, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats by merging situational awareness to create understanding during all phases of operations.

The Joint Force requires enhanced and integrated Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, and situational awareness capability sets to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS) is a new start in FY18 that will demonstrate these capabilities by enabling Joint operators to locate, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats.  The ECD JCACS will integrate advanced technologies to provide capability sets of equipment and situational awareness tools to protect against and mitigate the effects of contamination during WMD interdiction and site characterization missions.

The Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) provides ruggedized, networkable detectors with a wide operating range of detection, including prompt neutron/gamma, for integration into vehicles, fixed sites, and ships.  It replaces the obsolescent UDR-13 and AN/VDR-2 for mounted operations, providing warning and situational awareness for crews and personnel, and enables mounted RN surveillance and reconnaissance for platforms such as the NBCRV.

The Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA) as a FY18 new start is a ticket based sensor to provide chemical detection and identification capability to the Warfighter.  ROSETTA provides improved hazard detection sensitivity, increases the number of chemicals detected and lowers false alarm rate with an array of reactive colorimetric dyes printed on a detector ticket.  The ROSETTA program will complete the development and testing of the new detector ticket to update the currently fielded M256A2 kit.  The M256A2 technical data package will be updated with an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit.

The Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD), (formerly NGCD 4), is a wearable CWA, NTA, and TIC vapor detector.  This detector will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction interdiction capabilities to protect general forces.

Biosurveillance (BSV) programs provide a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics; and transition hardware/software tools and devices as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  BSV will align the biosurveillance efforts across DoD and national strategies.  BSV will scope and influence BSV capabilities as products to meet Warfighter requirements through innovative management of key BSV initiatives.  BSV requirements address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over eleven requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV supports Joint US Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat recognition (JUPITR) ATD, and JUONS CC-0557 which find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering CB threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a CB Event.  JUPITR ATD consists of four legs; Early Warning (EW), Biological Identification Capabilities Sets (BICS), Assessment of Environmental Detectors (AED), and Biosurveillance Portal (BSP).  The JUPITR ATD provides the USFK with a holistic biosurveillance capability to provide early warning, detection, collection, identification, and theater confirmation of a CB event.  The JUPITR ATD consists of filling capability gaps through information sharing and communication systems and detection/diagnostic systems for the USFK.  Outputs will focus on proving component, CONOPS, and subsystem transition into relevant technologies that are currently programs of record (PORs) to include global-BSP, Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) and CALS.  JUPITR system serves as the baseline configuration for ECD IEW.  Systems used in Operational Demonstration will be left behind with a two year sustainment plan for continuing use.  Live agent test of AED units support the Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance business case analysis for maritime and fixed site Point Biological Detection.

The CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance System (CBRN DRS) supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter.  The CBRN DRS Inc 2 will provide additional capability (beyond what is in CBRN DRS 1) to the follow-on technical forces to conduct more in-depth dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, sensitive site assessment, characterization of WMD/hazardous materials, events, or accidents, and sensitive site exploitation/elimination.  CBRN DRS Inc 2 will provide more sensitive and reliable detection and identification of CBRN threats, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for longer duration missions, and increased situation awareness through networked communications of the hazard.  The CBRN DRS Inc 2 configurations will be tailored to meet individual Service mission tasks. 

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) consists of several detection systems for vapor and aerosol monitoring (NGCD1), locating of liquid and solids on surfaces (NGCD 2), sampling of multiple phases of matter (NGCD 3), and initial assessment of wearable chemical vapor detection technology (NGCD 4).  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWA), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  The scope of the project includes detection of chemicals a few feet away from the detector as well as at the sampling point of the detector.  Additional tasks will ruggedize and test a system for nontraditional agent detection for special purpose units.  The NGCD program divides into separate programs starting in FY19: Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) formerly NGCD 1, Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) formerly NGCD 2, Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) formerly NGCD 3, and Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) formerly NGCD 4.

The NTA Defense program supports chemical and biological (CB) defense acquisition programs throughout entire acquisition process to address emerging threat , including investigating pharmaceutical based threats requirements across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition options/efforts (Programs of Record, Enhanced Capability Demonstrations (ECD), and Accelerated Acquisition) that account for the breadth and depth of emerging threats which span the full range of military missions.  The NTA Defense program provides essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and defense in depth concepts against emerging threats.  The program supports the JPEO portfolio which targets capabilities to reduce operational and tactical risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

BA4: NGCD used Full and Open competition to award TMRR contracts.  In FY18 NGCD 4 awarded a wearable technology assessment (WTA) contract to provide brassboard and breadboard prototypes for Government evaluation. 

BA5: In FY18 NGCD 1, 2, and 3 will use for Full and Open competition to award EMD contracts with production options under the NGCD funding line.  In FY19 the NGCD program divides into separate programs.  These contracts will continue in FY19 under the separate programs, AVCAD, PCAD, MPCAD funding lines.  U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded a contract with production options for Special Purpose (SP) Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKO) and JCAD Chemical Explosive Detector (CED).  The JCAD CED was initiated under NCGD effort to develop a modification kit for the JCAD to address NTA and threats of interests going to the SP SKO and Special Purpose Units (SPU).

WEARABLE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (WCAD)

Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD), (formerly NGCD 4), awarded a Wearable Technology Assessment (WTA) contract to provide brassboard and breadboard prototypes for Government evaluation.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV is a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics.  These capabilities will transition as residuals from the Biosurveillance Joint United States Force Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The JUPITR system of systems will be released to Busan Pier 8 and Camp Humphreys with a two year paid sustainment.  Lessons learned, technologies, concepts of employment from the ATD will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as G-BSP, EMBD, NGDS, JBTDS &amp; CALS).

CBRN SENSOR INTEGRATION ON ROBOTIC PLATFORMS (C-SIRP)

C-SIRP will utilize a rapid acquisition approach for the integration of CBRN capabilities to match the flexibility in needs of the unmanned platforms based on their operational modes summary/mission profiles (OMS/MPs).  A rapid acquisition approach, along with a flexible integration standard, utilizing common interface standards for hardware and software will be critical in the rapid turnaround capabilities needed for this CBRN defense capability.

CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS

CA4 The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) Inc 2 program will provide an Advanced Capabilities Set (ACS) for use by Joint Technical Forces in sensitive site assessment, exploitation and elimination missions in conjunction with their existing baseline CBRN DRS Inc1 system.  The ACS will be comprised of Government (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment to the greatest extent possible.  Requirements analysis will support Materiel Development Decision and provide guidance for the Analysis of Material Approaches (AoMA) to identify potential solutions.  Efforts will culminate in an approved Capabilities Development Document and a Milestone B.  Contracting efforts will be initiated under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production contract mechanism.  The contract will cover a base period of performance for development/integration with options for Low-Rate and Full Rate Production (FRP).

CA7 The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to a full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, well-managed acquisition program.  CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor production facilities.

ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMO INTEGRATED EARLY WARNING (ECD IEW)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW) will conduct an analysis of alternatives and leverage the DTRA IEW ATD to procure developmental equipment for experimentation and demonstration to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS TTPs, Non-CBRN sensors, and requirements to provide operational commanders time and space for freedom to maneuver and action.  The ECD IEW will utilize Table Top Exercises (TTX), Operational Demonstrations, and other test events to provide cross commodity equipment sets evaluation leading to the operational deployment to a unit to be determined, with two years of sustainment, further requirements development, CBDP program of record insertion, and concepts of employment.

ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION JOINT CBRNE ADV CAPABILITY SETS (ECD JCACS)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS) is an ECD that requires various equipment to be evaluated during User Feedback Events (UFE) and other test events.  The acquisition strategy uses existing task-order contracts (including support contracts) and existing supply contracts from Programs of Record to acquire the equipment and technical support required for the effort.  Additionally, JCACS will utilize other Government Agencies and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers to provide development, testing and technical support.

MOUNTED MANNED PLATFORM RADIOLOGICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (MMPRDS)

The Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) leverages technology transitioning from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency-Nuclear Technologies (DTRA/NT) to expedite technology maturation.  DTRA/NT-developed systems will provide component-level test data in support of Milestone B.  In Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD), MMPRDS exterior-mounted and interior-mounted vehicle sensors will be updated and delivered for use in joint evaluation with the NBCRV Sensor Suite Upgrade program, which will support Milestone C.  Based on market research, available COTS solutions for interior-mounted vehicle sensors may result in further acquisition streamlining for a portion of the solution set.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program initiatives transition information, technologies, and capabilities into existing and future acquisition programs (PORs, ECD/ACDs, and Accelerated Acquisition) and utilize a variety of contract mechanisms (full and open competition, existing task order contracts within DoD, and DLA).

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

The Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA) will use a streamlined acquisition strategy.  This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using a Full and Open competition to award multiple development contracts.  An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) will be prepared to update the M256A2 kits to the new M256A3 kits.  Full and Open Competition will also be used for the M256A3 Production Contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

The programs supported under this Project include (1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS), (2) Tactical Disablement System (TACDS), and (3) Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD).

The Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS) Program is based on capability gaps identified within both the Contamination Mitigation Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), dated March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs ICD, dated October 2008.  The program consists of two capabilities that will allow for the mitigation of chemical, biological and radiological contaminants in order to safely repatriate DOD-affiliated personnel back to the United States for final interment.  The two capabilities identified within the Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) Initial Capabilities Document: a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely repatriate chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States and a sustainable Contaminated Remains Mitigation System (CRMS) to reduce the hazard to warfighters by decontaminating chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains.  CRMS was previously known as Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System (CHRDS).  The CHRT is a containment system that will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.  The CRMS is a system of tents, plumbing, generators, and medical equipment necessary to establish a decontamination site to perform decontamination, identification, and packaging of contaminated human remains for further disposition.  The CRMS will reduce the hazards associated with contaminated human remains through decontamination of remains and enable positive identification of remains for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner before packaging in a CHRT.

The TACDS will provide the tactical capability to disable (delay, disrupt, degrade) and / or defeat (destroy) small quantities of chemical warfare materials and biological warfare materials in bulk containers and munitions in an hostile operational environment.  DoD's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Strategy enables early action through pathway defeat, shaping the environment to dissuade actors from pursuing WMD.  The strategy also asserts the Department must respond effectively to WMD crises when called upon.

The Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD) program is an FY19 new start intended to correct capability gaps identified within the Consequence Management Initial Capabilities Document.  The program will develop an array of rugged and reliable best-of-breed hardware in a manageably sized, easy to erect, modular system that can be quickly tailored to different Mass Casualty events in order to support decontamination of both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS) Program product development will consist of the design and prototyping of both a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) and a Contaminated Remains Mitigation System (CRMS).  Existing efforts under a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement has allowed for the acceleration of the CHRT effort, and with additional minor design modifications, developmental and operational testing via two Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract awards with two vendors for prototyping and production units in 3QFY18 results in Milestone C decision in FY19, and a Full Rate Production in FY20.  The CRMS effort plans for a Milestone A in FY19, and a (FFP) contract award for prototyping and production units in 1QFY20.

TACTICAL DISABLEMENT SYSTEM (TACDS)

(1)	Utilizing mature technologies, the TACDS program will take an incremental approach towards the development, integration, test and production of a family of systems (FoS).  Developmental efforts in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase (TMRR) and the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase (EMD) will be contracted through full and open competition.  Production and Deployment will also be competed through full and open competition.

MASS PERSONNEL DECON (MPD)

The Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD) Program will seek a materiel solution to process DoD-affiliated personnel contaminated by chemical, biological, and radiological agents in order to achieve ambulatory and non-ambulatory throughput requirements as dictated by the needs of the Services.  The program will develop the equipment, processes and procedures to allow for operational use by all DoD agencies with a competitive/sole source contract for prototyping and production units.  Key developmental efforts will include the reduction of current Mass Casualty Decontamination (MCD) System sustainment costs by assessing existing MCD equipment and processes as well as new technology through the use of RFIs, Market Research Analyses and Technology Demonstrations.  These efforts will additionally support the development of hazardous waste disposal and the potential integration with a Contaminated Human Remains capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

Efforts included in this project are: (1) the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 2 and the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS).  In FY19, CBRN Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 2 (UIPE 2) will transition to CBRN Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS).

UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users individual percutaneous protective equipment with the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will seek to address the broader scope of the UIPE Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), to include protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear/Toxic Industrial Material threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  

The UIPE Increment 2 is being transitioned to UIPE FoS because the program will have more than one solution to meet the Warfighters needs.  This is reflected not only in the name change but in the structure of the program.  The program is designed to meet mission area needs, not individual Service needs.  There are four Mission Areas: Land, Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS solutions will seek to fulfill.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

The UIPE Increment 2 will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The acquisition strategy allows for multiple decision points throughout product development, which provides flexibility to accelerate mature commercial-off the-shelf/non-developmental item solutions and fully develop less mature solutions.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  Pre-Milestone A activities included the exploration of available state of the art technologies through market research, Requests for Information, and a challenge competition; shaping realistic requirements by exploring trade space of novel technologies; and identified protection offered by non-chemical biological (CB) combat gear.  The Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase will reduce technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk.  During this phase, the program will focus on forming mission profile areas designed to narrow the focus of solutions designed specifically for a certain Warfighter functional area.  Early testing will aide in deciding what is possible for each mission profile area and feed information into the trade space analysis.  Developmental/Operational Testing will assess the ability of the solution to meet requirements, demonstrate system technical performance in accordance with the operational requirements, and demonstrate performance in realistic conditions.  An Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach will be used to procure informational white papers during the TMRR phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (UIPE FOS)

The UIPE Family of Systems (FoS) will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles (Land, Sea, Air and Homeland Defense) with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  Pre-Milestone A activities included the exploration of available state of the art technologies through market research, Requests for Information, and a challenge competition; shaping realistic requirements by exploring trade space of novel technologies; and identified protection offered by non-chemical biological (CB) combat gear.  The Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase will reduce technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk.

The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.  Once Milestone B is achieved for the Family of Systems each mission profile will be broken out onto their own budget lines.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) responsible for providing the information architecture and applications for shaping the battlespace against the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threat.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); (2) the Joint Effects Model (JEM); (3) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); and (4) the Software Support Activity (SSA).  

The BSP program addresses USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.

BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources.

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all Warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on increments of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides, such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  JEM will also allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited Department of Defense (DOD) warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides an over-lay of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification. 

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014.  The BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs).  There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016.  A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

It is anticipated JEM 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN-IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-3 and RDP-4 prior to contract completion. 

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN integrator, a follow-on contract Request for Proposal (RFP) is targeted for release Q4 FY17 with a targeted award date of Q3 FY18.  The follow-on contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JWARN follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN software development and maintenance contract.

It is anticipated JWARN 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

This Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports:

The Medical Countermeasures Platform (MCMPT) effort is focused on applying proven platform technologies to streamline medical countermeasure (MCM) delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risks, accelerating schedule to FDA licensure, and reducing development costs.  In addition, this effort will employ platform technologies to support a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats.  A platform is a technology that can counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to accelerate MCM delivery to the Force.  The first platform being established is the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT).  Efforts will center on leveraging the DOD's Advanced Development and Manufacturing facility.  It is a new start in FY18.

The Department of Defense (DoD) supports the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase for vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these biological warfare (BW) agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  

The Medical Countermeasure BSL-4 GLP Test and Evaluation capability performs T&amp;E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation.  This capability provides dedicated capacity for DoD to conduct biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) T&amp;E studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.

The Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.

The NGDS Family of Systems program provides Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease diagnostic capabilities across several echelons of care, as well as for environmental sample analysis as part of the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  The NGDS Increment 1 provides an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared reusable, portable biological pathogen diagnostic system to Army, Air Force and Navy deployable Combat Health Support units, to support near real-time patient treatment decision making, force health protection decision making and CBRN situational awareness.  NGDS Increment 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.

The Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO) Program develops vaccines that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  The program office is prioritizing the development and delivery of a licensed Marburg vaccine while working with Science &amp; Technology to further develop Ebola vaccine candidates to meet the DoD requirement.  The current budget supports development of multiple Marburg prototypes to protect against the BW threat through TMRR phase.  The DoD anticipates that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve a vaccine using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in a relevant animal model(s).

The Next Generation Anthrax Vaccine (NGA) program seeks to provide a more robust vaccine for Anthrax, which is a validated bioweapon threat to the Force.  The current anthrax vaccine dose schedule requires multiple doses to be fully protective.  Health and Human Services is developing a next generation vaccine for post exposure to anthrax.  The DoD is seeking to leverage HHS development efforts and initiate preliminary assay development and qualification studies to extend the label to include pre exposure.  This effort could potentially lead to an improved dosing schedule for the next generation anthrax vaccine.

The Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat that is lethal, available and easily produced.  The Ricin vaccine program (VAC Ricin) supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing cGMP lots; and the continuation of animal model and assay development studies.  The Ricin Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to ricin toxin.

The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program initiated competitive prototypes in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing multiple prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; western, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.  Services have prioritized the development and delivery of a licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) vaccine.  In FY19 the VAC WEVEE program will shift to the VAC VEE program.

The Antiviral Therapeutic Program (AV TX) will develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter.  Drug products will be developed targeting the pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, such as Ebola.  This includes viruses of interest from the following families: Filoviridae, Alphaviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.  Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter.  In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  BA5 Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing.  The early stage efforts (BA4) are to develop standardized design capabilities to support a rapid response.  Once established, future programs will be able to leverage this capability for the development of specific medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority through the medical OTA consortium.

BSL4 GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES TEST &amp; EVALUATION (BSL4 GLP T&amp;E)

The Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCM) BSL-4 T&amp;E capability continues to utilize and maintain a testing capability at the existing and planned new US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) facilities.  MCM BSL-4 T&amp;E costs support testing of MCMs against threats that require high-level containment using non-human primates.  The period of FY18 and beyond will focus on transition of the capability to the new USAMRIID facility, after which Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be reached.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B Program develops MCMs for MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  To meet the requirement to prevent or minimize the effects from MDR Bacterial exposures, the CMDR-B program will follow an integrated product development process and undergo independent regulatory affairs processes to achieve an FDA approved drug.  The CMDR-B program is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities, and commercial partners in order to populate the MDR pipeline which will help reduce program risk, potentially lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate the delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program has established a translational team with the Joint Science and Technology Office for animal model work and pipeline candidates that could transition to CMDR-B for Advanced Development.  The CMDR-B program also has a partnership with DHHS/BARDA to manufacture developmental drug product that will support an Interim Fielding Capability for a plague therapeutic for post-exposure protection and treatment.  The CMDR-B program intends to have a Milestone B Decision Review in 1QFY19.  Results from the program investment in Non-Human Primate Pivotal efficacy testing, conducted in TMRR phase, in FY17 may result in Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 mature candidates being ready for further development.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS program was a MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 will replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and concepts of employment (COEs) that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address.  More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care.  NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities.  Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements.  Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards under the medical Other Transactions Authority (OTA), to take advantage of non-traditional Defense contractor offerings.

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The acquisition strategy combined the Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) and Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID TX) Program efforts beginning in FY17, into a single program to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral countermeasures.  Independent market research conducted in FY15 identified multiple candidates appropriate for advanced development at varying stages of maturity.  A source selection was conducted targeting award in FY16.  The candidate selected for entry into the EMD phase of development will be executed under the Antiviral Therapeutic program in FY17.  The candidate selected for entry into the TMRR phase will be deferred for award until FY17 when BA4 funding is available to the program.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of a products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The Filovirus Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple vaccines through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  During this phase a manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to produce current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for Phase 1 clinical trials.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA and conduct Phase 1 clinical trials.  These efforts will support a MS B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  At Milestone B (MS B), the best Marburg vaccine prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the delivery of an FDA licensed Marburg vaccine.  It is anticipated that the EMD phase contract will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DoD agencies and laboratories to include the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing qualification/validation, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support the Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensure of a Marburg vaccine.

NEXT GENERATION ANTHRAX VACCINE (VAC NGA)

The Next Generation Anthrax vaccine program strategy supports the development and qualification of immunological assays and required reference materials to support potential future anthrax vaccine programs.  Once qualified, these assays will provide the DOD with data to support future decisions related to the anthrax pre-exposure vaccine program.

RICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)

The Ricin Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supports the development of a single vaccine through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of aerosolized ricin toxin.  The Government will serve as the integrator during the TMRR phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with DoD agencies and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).

VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (VAC VEE)

The VEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of Virus Replicon Particle (VRP) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through a Phase 1 clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Development phase.  Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes for possible down select.  The schedule is based on a down select to one prototype.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine.  The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Additionally, the Program Office will partner with Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.

WESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)

The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine program initiated competitive prototypes in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing multiple prototypes through the Technology Development Phase.  The Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; western, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.  Services have prioritized the development and delivery of a licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) vaccine.  In FY19 the VAC WEVEE program will shift to the VAC VEE program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  The program currently includes: (1) Emerging Threats and (2), the Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM).

The Emerging Threats program provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. forces in the field.  The Emerging Threats program is specifically supporting the discovery, characterization, development, and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic medical countermeasures (MCMs) to protect the warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), a high priority.  This FY19 new start consists of transitioning a medical countermeasure against carfentanil into advanced development no later than FY2020.  

The Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM)) to provide protection across current and emerging threats, (2) nonclinical studies to demonstrate the safety of the pyridostigmine bromide (PB) product, and (3) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA), while expanding warfighter pretreatment options.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EMERGING THREAT CHEMICAL THERAPEUTICS (EMRT)

The Medical Countermeasures Systems Joint Program Management Office (JPM-MCS), an element of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) provides U.S. military forces and the nation safe, effective, and innovative medical solutions to counter CBRN threats.  This program provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. forces in the field.  It supports efforts to develop and produce FDA-approved therapeutic and prophylactic solutions to counter emerging threats.  This program includes the Emerging Threats (EMRT) program, which consists of transitioning a medical countermeasure against carfentanil into advanced development no later than FY2020.  This strategy will consider use of already existing candidates for incorporation into an autoinjector-based capability, if found to meet DoD requirements.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy has expanded to insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent.  This strategy employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid development and delivery in a combined treatment regimen of (1) an improved oxime, and (2) CA capabilities, and to evaluate safety of PB when treating exposure of other traditional and novel organophosphorous nerve agents.  In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and nonclinical studies to evaluate safety of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) when used to counter other traditional and novel organophosphorus nerve agents.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA components, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the commercial partner(s) will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The Government will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS products.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the Government will pursue full-rate and stockpile production, conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies, and will transfer contracting/ logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) Product Director, Test, Equipment, Strategy, and Support (PD TESS).  Project will continue as Chem Bio Material Assessment Infrastructure (CBMAI) beginning in fiscal year 2019.  TESS/CBMAI provides test infrastructure products to support testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process.  TESS/CBMAI products are aligned in three areas to include: (1) Analysis and Requirements; (2) Laboratory; (3) Field.  The program name changed to highlight the Assessment function, which includes: analysis and analytical products conducted in support of infrastructure improvements.

(1) Analysis and Requirements: The products for this area are the analyses of requirements and justification of needs for test infrastructure to support acquisition efforts (e.g. Programs of Record (PORs), Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), and Accelerated Acquisition).  The result is a verified need for component upgrades to existing test infrastructure, dynamic laboratory upgrades to existing test infrastructure, or initiation of new test infrastructure. 

(2) Laboratory: The products for this area are the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) and improvements to the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Aerosol-Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) (formerly Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD 1)), Proximity Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2), Multiphase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3), Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) (formerly NGCD 4), Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) Increment 2 and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.

(3) Field: The products for this area are Test Grid, Open Architecture Data Management System (OADMS) (formerly Safari Test Grid), Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT), and Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; real-time cloud tracking capability; meteorological equipment; a wireless network; and a Data Management System (DMS) software to track and display the simulant cloud; and provide status of all of the equipment in the network at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  OADMS is an all-inclusive, open architecture, mobile management service functioning wirelessly, capable of integrating, controlling, commanding and managing all assets required to conduct chemical and biological (CB) tests at any Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  OADMS provides algorithms and graphical user interfaces for automating real-time visualization, raw data, computation, hosts data collection and indefinite storage that can go to any MRTFB for CB Testing.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow establishment of test data correlation between laboratory-tunnels-field for test results.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).

Experimentation and demonstration will be used to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Operational forces have an immediate need to survive, safely operate, and sustain operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) threat environment across the continuum of global, contingency, special operations/low intensity conflict, counternarcotics, and other high-risk missions.  Operating forces have a critical need for defense against worldwide proliferation of CB warfare capabilities and for medical treatment of CB casualties.  Congress directed centralized management of Department of Defense (DoD) CB Defense initiatives, both medical and non-medical.  This program element supports the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of medical and physical CB defensive equipment and materiel.  Projects within BA5 are structured to consolidate Joint and Service-unique tasks within four commodity areas: contamination avoidance, individual and collective force protection, decontamination, and medical countermeasures.  This consolidation provides for development and operational testing of equipment for Joint Service use and for Service-unique requirements.  

Contamination avoidance efforts under this system development program will provide U.S. forces with real-time hazard assessment capabilities.  They include multi-agent point and remote chemical detection for ground, aircraft, and shipboard applications; automated warning and reporting systems; integrated radiation detection and monitoring equipment; and enhanced battlefield reconnaissance capabilities.  Force protection efforts will increase protection levels while decreasing physical and psychological burdens imposed by protective equipment.  

The Secretary of Defense is responsible for research, development, acquisition, and deployment of medical countermeasure equipment and materiel to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CB threats to the Armed Forces and directs strategic planning for and oversight of programs to support medical countermeasures development and acquisition for our Armed Forces personnel.  The CB medical threat to the Armed Forces, in contrast with public health threats to U.S. citizens, encompasses all potential or continuing enemy actions that can render a Service Member combat ineffective.  CB medical threats, because they apply as a whole to military units deployed on a specific mission and/or operations, may result in the unit being unable to complete its mission.  CB medical countermeasures developed by DoD, unlike those developed to support the U.S. population, must support military commanders practical operational requirements and deployment strategies and must emphasize prevention of injury and illness and protection of the force.  Preventive measures in this EMD, such as vaccines and chemical prophylaxis, conserves fighting strength, decreases the logistics burden by reducing the need for larger deployed hospital footprint and greater demand for tactical and strategic medical evacuation, and satisfy the need for greater flexibility in military planning and operations.  When vaccines and other prophylactic medical countermeasures are not available, efforts on this EMD support pre-hospitalization treatment, en-route care, hospital care, and long-term clinical outcomes.  Specific items in this category include CB diagnostics, and therapeutics to mitigate the consequences of chemical and biologic threats and exposure to ionizing radiation due to nuclear or radiological attacks.

The DoD coordinates its efforts with the Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to promote synergy and minimize redundancy.  The DoD ensures coordination by participating in the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise interagency strategic planning process ("One Portfolio").  The DoD's longstanding experience and success in CB medical countermeasure research, development, acquisition, and deployment not only ensures protection of the Armed Forces, it also accelerates and improves the overall national efforts in CB medical countermeasure research, development, and acquisition because of its unique facilities, testing capabilities, and trained and experienced personnel.  

The projects in this program element support efforts in the engineering and manufacturing phase of the acquisition strategy and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 5.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.  Efforts included in this project are: (1) Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD), (formerly NGCD 1); (2) Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD); (3) The Joint Handheld Bio-Agent Identifier (JHBI); (4) Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS); (5) Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD), (formerly NGCD 3); (6) Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD), (formerly NGCD 2); (7) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA); (8) Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS); (9) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS); (10) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD); (11) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; (12) the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI).

The Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) (formerly NGCD 1) will provide the Joint Forces a man-portable system to detect and identify aerosol and vapor chemical threats and will also be employed on manned and unmanned platforms.

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) addresses the Navy detection and identification capability gaps and replaces/upgrades the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) currently fielded to the Navy.  The EMBD system provides improved detection sensitivity, lower false alarms and a modernized computing architecture.  The EMBD program will complete development and testing, integration and production of a lower cost biological point detection system to detect, collect and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  The EMBD provides automated warning and reduces sustainment cost while protecting the shipboard personnel.

The Joint Handheld Bio-Agent Identifier (JHBI) program is a Joint Service Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program consisting of two increments to address an existing United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requirement for handheld, multiplexed, environmental, bio-agent identification.  The JHBI program was initiated under the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) and will provide three different handheld bio-identification systems for the rapid and accurate identification of organisms at the point of contact for multiple mission types.  The proposed JHBI systems will be handheld, Polymerase Chain Reaction-based, multiplexed devices for the analysis of powder or liquid environmental biological samples.  JHBI capabilities will provide Special Operations Forces with timely and accurate identification of 8 or more bio-agents at the point of need.  JHBI 1 is anticipated to serve as a supplemental capability to the BioFire RAZOR with JHBI 2 fielding the complete replacement of the RAZOR by FY20.  JHBI will transition out from under the JBTDS to its own funding line in FY18. 

The Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) provides ruggedized, networkable detectors with a wide operating range of detection, including prompt neutron/gamma, for integration into vehicles, fixed sites, and ships.  It replaces the obsolescent UDR-13 and AN/VDR-2 for mounted operations, providing warning and situational awareness for crews and personnel, and enables mounted RN surveillance and reconnaissance for platforms such as the NBCRV.

The Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3) will provide a sample analysis to identify, quantify, alarm to, and report on diverse chemical species in vapor, aerosol, liquid, and solid phases of matter.

The Proximate Chemical Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2) is to provide a portable system for the rapid location, detection and identification of liquid and solid chemical threats on surfaces and may be handheld, tripod mounted, or mounted on unmanned platforms. 

The Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA) is a ticket based sensor to provide chemical detection and identification capability to the Warfighter.  ROSETTA provides improved hazard detection sensitivity, increases the number of chemicals detected and lowers false alarm rate as compared to the M256A2 with an array of reactive colorimetric dyes printed on a detector ticket.  The ROSETTA program will complete the development and testing of the new detector ticket to update the currently fielded M256A2 kit.  The M256A2 technical data package will be updated with an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit.

Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS) is the Sensor Suite Upgrade (SSU) for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV).  The NBCRV Sensor Suite is the Mission Equipment Package for the Stryker NBCRV and consists of chemical point detectors, a standoff chemical vapor detector, a biological point detector, a chemical vapor sampling system, radiological detectors, and the Sensor Processing Group.  NBCRV SS provides the Stryker NBCRV the ability to detect, identify, collect, report, and mark NBC Hazards.  The Stryker NBCRV SSU will improve chemical, biological and radiological and nuclear detection and identification capabilities, increase the maneuver speed of the Stryker NBCRV when conducting NBC mission and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) program is developing, integrating and testing the first lightweight, low cost biological surveillance system to detect, collect, and identify biological warfare agent aerosols.  JBTDS provides warning through the Joint Warning And Reporting Network (JWARN) and archives samples for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS provides near real-time local audio and visual alarm, and may be employed by any Military User.  JBTDS components are man-portable, battery-operable, and easy to employ.  JBTDS provides notification of a hazard and enhances battle space awareness to protect and preserve the force.  When networked JBTDS augments existing biological detection systems providing a theater-wide array capable of biological detection, identification and warning to support time sensitive force protection decisions.  The JBTDS provides surface sampling capability to support sensitive site exploitation missions.  Surface sampler interfaces with the JBTDS identifier

The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is several detection systems for: vapor and aerosol monitoring (NGCD1), location of liquid and solids on surfaces (NGCD 2), sampling of multiple phases of matter (NGCD 3), and Wearable System (NGCD 4).  NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWA), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity on multiple platforms as well as multiple environments.  The sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes detection of chemicals a few feet away from the detector as well as at the sampling point of the detector.  Additional tasks will ruggedize and test a system for nontraditional agent detection for special purpose units.  The NGCD program divides into separate programs starting in FY19: Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) formerly NGCD 1, Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) formerly NGCD 2, Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) formerly NGCD 3, and Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) formerly NGCD 4.  NCGD funded a USSOCOM effort to develop a modification kit to JCAD to address NTA and threats of interests going into the SP SKO and SPU units.

The Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense program supports the on-going chemical and biological (CB) defense efforts as acquisition programs address emerging threat requirements including pharmaceutical based threats across the full spectrum of commodities.  Dedicated initiatives and projects will develop and transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition options and efforts (e.g. Programs of Record, Enhanced Capability Demonstrations, and Accelerated Acquisition) that account for the breadth and depth of advanced, emerging, and unknown CB threats and span the full range of defense missions.  The NTA Defense program will provide essential enablers such as threat understanding; operational impacts of performance trades; and comprehensive, integrated, and layered defense concepts against advanced, emerging, and unknown CB threats.  The program will support a balanced portfolio which will target capabilities to reduce operational and tactical risk from technology gaps inherent from emerging threats.  Additional efforts in conducting systems engineering analysis will occur in order to identify and consolidate capability knowledge gaps and prioritize required investments.  These initiatives allow the CBDP to mitigate risk against emerging threats and better prepare the warfighter to deal with surprises across the full range of military missions.

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) will research and characterize laboratory networks and develop algorithms to identify key nodes, having the greatest potential to compress the time between disease event initiation and the production of actionable data.  In FY19, GBTI will close.  The Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) will track projects of mutual interest, formerly under GBTI, with the Chemical Biological Defense Program.  Under TARMAC, these projects will cover a variety of activities and will provide data and information used to facilitate the identification of unknown threats and the development of new countermeasures.  Key node data generation will be augmented in direct support of existing programs of record such as the Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Bioinformatics effort, in conjunction with whole genomic sequencing, provides a robust and unique capability to the Warfighter, especially in OCONUS and geographically disparate areas.  The next generation sequencing provides for a screening capability for pathogens for which there are no assays, provides a mechanism to determine when pathogens are no longer detected by assays, and provides analytical tools that are rapidly changing with regard to analysis capabilities.  The utilization of whole genomic sequencing will assist in determining existing network limitations and capabilities for data sharing.</r2:Text>

ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) program uses a streamlined acquisition strategy.  This approach is based on the mature technology that will transition from the Assessment of Environmental Detection (AED) leg of the Joint USFK Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) to a program of record for the US Navy.  The EMBD program enters into acquisition at MS B and makes maximum use of the testing to date through the JUPITR program to field the replacement for the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) in the Navy.  EMBD is utilizing the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production/Procurement (JE-RDAP) contract at MS B for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  An Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released in 2nd Quarter FY18 for a competitive procurement.

GLOBAL BIO TECH INITIATIVE (GBTI)

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) strategy establishes a robust data stream that directly supports existing programs of record in their development of biological defense countermeasures through the characterization of laboratory networks and augmentation of key nodes within those networks.  This will be accomplished through the use of a University of Affiliated Research Center (Johns Hopkins University) to characterize laboratory networks and develop decision-making tools for evaluating potential augmentation of key nodes prior to investment.

JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)

Full and open competition was utilized at MS B for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  Chemring Detection Systems was awarded the EMD contract on 2 April 2015.  The JBTDS addresses legacy Special Purpose Units (SPU) requirements gaps/deficiencies through development and optimization of COTS/GOTS systems.

JOINT HANDHELD BIO-AGENT IDENTIFIER (JHBI)

The JHBI program will pursue a collaborative accelerated acquisition strategy to incrementally deliver capability to USSOCOM.  JHBI will use commercial items to procure candidate systems from 3 vendors for further development and fielding.  JHBI is co-managed and co-executed through an acquisition partnership between the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and USSOCOM to expand the relationship between JPEO-CBD and USSOCOM and leverage acquisition and subject matter expertise on both sides to reduce acquisition timelines and improve customer satisfaction.  Specifically, JHBI is using the USSOCOM requirement validation and test and evaluation resources from program inception through Milestone C.  The JHBI program acquired test-articles of a single commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) platform with relevant assays for the JHBI Combat Evaluation (CV), which served as the decision gate for the completion of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.  To mitigate risk, additional technologies were identified and inserted into the JHBI program.

JOINT NBC RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM - STRYKER (JNBCRS)

Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRVSS) Upgrade is an upgrade for the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle.  The contract approach for the Sensor Suite Upgrade will be a Full and Open Cost Plus Incentive Fee Engineering Manufacturing Development contracts with Fixed Price Incentive Fee options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.

MOUNTED MANNED PLATFORM RADIOLOGICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (MMPRDS)

The Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) leverages technology transitioning from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency-Nuclear Technologies (DTRA/NT) to expedite technology maturation.  DTRA/NT-developed systems will provide component-level test data in support of Milestone B.  In Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD), MMPRDS exterior-mounted and interior-mounted vehicle sensors will be updated and delivered for use in joint evaluation with the NBCRV Sensor Suite Upgrade program, which will support Milestone C.  Based on market research, available COTS solutions for interior-mounted vehicle sensors may result in further acquisition streamlining for a portion of the solution set.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program initiatives transition information, technologies, and capabilities into existing and future acquisition programs (PORs, ECD/ACDs, and Accelerated Acquisition) and utilize a variety of contract mechanisms (full and open competition, existing task order contracts within DoD, and DLA).

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

The Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA) will use a streamlined acquisition strategy.  This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using a Full and Open competition to award multiple development contracts.  An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) will be prepared to update the M256A2 kits to the new M256A3 kits.  Full and Open Competition will also be used for the M256A3 Production Contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development of the following program: The Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS) will be modular, scalable and adaptable to a variety of concept of operations (CONOPS) and environmental conditions.  Currently, fielded systems have been designed and fielded independently by the services with the intent of meeting a specific unit requirement.  As a result, multiple mobile lab configurations exist with differing sustainment tails and lacking in commonality.  The CALS will provide common analytical capabilities packaged to meet the specific CONOPS and mission of the gaining unit.  The analytical capabilities will detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs).  Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Navy. 

There will be three variants of CALS as detailed below: 

1.  Field Confirmatory Integrated System (FC-IS) Variant - NGB and Marine Corp User
-Integrates CBR systems into a common make / model 20-foot International Standard Organization (ISO) container.  The container will be integrated onto the International Durastar vehicle to support employment.

2.  Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) Variant - Army User
-Similar to the FC-IS but provides a higher level of confidence in analytical results through the use of orthogonal (complimentary) technologies and an expanded analytical suite.  This system employs multiple standardized ISO containers, which will be integrated onto one Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and one trailer, to support the needed additional laboratory space.

3.  Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS) Variant - Army, Navy, Air Force and NGB User - A palletized / transportable equipment subsets that allows them to be loaded into transport cases and palletized.  Enables the users to receive the Chemical and Biological (CB) subsystems that meet their specific mission profiles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COMMON ANALYTICAL LABORATORY SYSTEM (CALS)

The Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) will be developed leveraging both Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Non-traditional agent materials in environmental samples technology.  The (CALS) program is designed to provide an affordable, modular, scalable and sustainable field analytic capability that can be readily transported to meet the mission profile and requirements of the gaining organization.  CALS will consist of (3) variants which will be fielded, in accordance with mission need, to components of the Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy and National Guard Bureau requiring CBRN field confirmatory analytical detection capability.  Post Milestone B (FY15), a hybrid contract (CPIF / FPI / FFP) was awarded to develop, design and build these system variant prototypes in order to conduct developmental test (DT) and evaluation.  The Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Set (FC ACS) entered DT first and to reached an early Milestone C - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) (FY17) followed by a Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision prior to the Milestone C (LRIP) (FY19) and (FRP) Decision for the FC (1st Quarter, FY20) and TV Integrated Systems.  After each Milestone C, contracts will be awarded to produce the (3) variants of the Common Analytical Laboratory System using Fixed Price (FP) Contract vehicles.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments.  CP systems can be installed on any type of platform, such as, hard and soft shelters, vehicles, ships, aircraft, and buildings.  CP systems provide spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs).

The systems included in this project are: (1) Chemical-Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) and (2) Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Family of Systems.

The CASB will provide a lightweight, low-cost, expendable, negative-pressure enclosure that will protect the interior of multi-service aircraft (MH-47, CV22, MC-130) capable of airlifting/exfiltrating chemically or biologically contaminated personnel, equipment, contagious patients, and cargos while preserving the aircraft for continued unrestricted operations without need for extensive decontamination.  

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  JECP is a family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone CP systems and kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits to provide CBRN protection to other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY BARRIER (CASB)

CASB will field a capability that will support the overall intent of the (Aircraft CBRN Contamination Survivability ACCS) Initial Capabilities Development (ICD) in the areas of barriers, aircraft containment systems, modular Collective Protection (ColPro) for aircraft interiors, and disposable ColPro.  CASB is one member of a family of systems that will support the ICD.  It will protect the interior of DoD airlift assets from incidental cross-contamination by CB-contaminated personnel and equipment and cargos under transport.  The overall strategy is to utilize primary materials (air filtration and flexible barrier material) currently in use by other programs in the CB defense portfolio in a negative pressure system specifically designed for airframe use.  CASB will review existing materials and technology as well as designs, configurations, and test data from legacy systems developed for ColPro applications.  Using this information, systems will be developed to meet the broader range of airframes and airframe specific requirements, chemical biological protection and logistic supportability that are now required.  Based on commonality between the requirements of the CASB and the requirements of similar programs (i.e. Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection, TIS, and Aeromedical Biological Containment System), CASB will be initiated at MS B EMD phase to meet these expanded requirements within the various airframes.  CASB will leverage an IDIQ contract to pursue a Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) development strategy using full and open competition for awards following MS B and MS C.  During the EMD phase, CASB intends to award a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) delivery order for the development and delivery of prototypes for airworthiness certification within two years.  During the Production phase, CASB intends to pursue a Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) delivery order to reduce the logistical burden and sustainment costs.

JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Production and Deployment Phases of the program.  Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 under the current Leidos contract to meet Initial Operational Capability.  A competitive build-to-print follow-on production task order under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition, and Production (JE-RDAP) Contract will be awarded in FY19 to support production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC).  Phase 2 systems will be developed starting in FY18 as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate JE-RDAP competitive task order and will undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision in FY21.  Production options will be included in the task order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems.  Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS.  BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various environmental control unit types for use with collective protection.  These efforts involve a simplified acquisition procurement contract and exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.  BA7 product development and testing will continue through FY19 with an expectation to achieve production readiness at the end of FY19.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for: (1) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP); (2) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS); (3) DFoS General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD); and (4) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations and Tactics, Techniques &amp; Procedures.

The MDAP Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Initiative ensures weapon system programs at all Acquisition Category (ACAT) levels, as well as non-DoD agency programs such as those programs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meet their CBRN defense requirements.  This effort facilitates and coordinates the research, development, test and evaluation, procurement, delivery, and life cycle sustainment of affordable CBRN defense materiel solutions for each program's documented CBRN requirements.

DFoS CIDAS is a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology.  It will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three applicator configurations (small-scale, tactical large scale, and reusable large scale applicators) and three indicator formulations (nerve training, nerve and blister indicators).  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  DFoS CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

DFoS GPD is a liquid, field adjustable decontaminant for chemical and biological agents that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crewserved weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination while providing the lowest logistical footprint. 
 
The JBADS will provide the capability to conduct biological agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of the C-130 aircraft.  The JBADS is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated airframes to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.  Future capability may address biological decontamination of other airframes and vehicles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM (MDAP)

The MDAP program provides assistance to non-CBD programs with meeting and or optimizing their Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) survivability and force protection capabilities.  The MDAP also provides systems engineering analyses to develop CBRN specific operational and technical requirements, identifies performance gaps between existing materiel and technical requirements, develops cost and schedule estimates, conducts preliminary CBRN T&amp;E and logistics planning, develops CBRN defense architectures products, and performs trade space analyses for a number of non-CBD programs.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The DFoS CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with user developed capability documents.  Following MS A, the program office collaborated with external efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  The DFoS CIDAS program determined the need for and initiated Government designed reusable and tactical large scale applicators to provide affordable solutions to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, the program used full and open competition to award a performance based indefinite quantity contract with fixed price incentive successive target contract line items, with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) for nerve indicator and small scale applicator systems.  The DFoS CIDAS program will award a sole source, performance based indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for a blister technology.  The program will integrate the Contractor and Government designed indicator and applicators and conduct developmental and operational testing.

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved DFoS GPD to by-pass Milestone (MS) B and enter directly to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  During the TD Phase, the DFoS GPD Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the DFoS GPD Program entered the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program continued to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Following the MS C/LRIP decision the program acquired the Tech Data Package, allowing for the future establishment of an organic production line for LRIP and FRP production quantities.  This strategy ensures that all prospective sources, with the capability of meeting the program requirements, have the opportunity to participate.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBADS)

The JBADS acquisition approach is to leverage information and technology from the JBADS Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) to support entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition cycle.  The EMD is supported by a Technology Readiness Assessment of 7 from the JCTD.  The JBADS will utilize Commercial-off-the-Shelf components for the shelter, the decontamination delivery system, the environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components with the award of a competitive contract to produce, operate, and sustain the system.  The program as a whole utilizes the evolutionary acquisition approach for future increments that may expand JBADS capabilities to include other platforms (aircraft and vehicles) as requirements dictate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTP).

Efforts included in this project are: (1) the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) Rotary Wing (RW), JSAM for Strategic Aircraft (SA), JSAM for Tactical Aircraft (TA), JSAM Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), and (2) Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE) Family of Systems (Increment 2). 

(1) The JSAM RW, JSAM SA, JSAM TA, and JSAM-JSF are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs developed to provide respiratory and ocular protection.  The JSAM is a lightweight Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective mask for most United States Army (USA), Navy (USN), Air Force (USAF), and Marine Corps (USMC) fixed wing and RW aircrew.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most Below-The-Neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE).  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly (except JSAM SA), and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame protection, demist/emergency demist (except JSAM SA), and anti-drowning features.  The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to operate in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment.  

The JSAM RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the USA (H-60, H-6, H-47, H-72), USAF (H-1 and H-60), and USN/USMC (H-60, H-1, and H-53).  The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and RW flight helmets.  The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly "face free" in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 3 (garment, boots, and mask) and easily install the face plate when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological and psychological burden.  If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 (garments, boots, gloves and mask) without removing their flight helmet.  

The JSAM SA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select toxic industrial chemicals for USAF (E-3, E-8, C-135s, C-17, C-145, C-146, C-130s, C-5), Aeromedical personnel (C-130s, KC-10, U-18, CV-22, KC-135, C-12s, KC-46), USN (P-8, E-6, C-40, C-12, C-20), USMC (C-9, C-12, C-20, UC-35), and USA (RC-7, C-12s, C-20, C-26, UC-35, C-37) strategic aircrew.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM SA will provide pressure breathing for altitude for aircraft that do not require pressure breathing for gravity.  JSAM SA will integrate with aircraft subsystems which include aviation life support equipment, aircrew flight equipment, aircraft seating, portable aircrew systems, communications systems, and aircraft oxygen systems.  

The JSAM TA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select toxic industrial chemicals for USAF (F-22 A), USN (C-2 A, E-2 C/D, E/A-18G, F/A-18 A/C/E/F), and USMC (F/A-18 A/C/D, AV-8B, KC-130J and MV-22) tactical aircrew members.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM TA will be compatible with anti-G systems, providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) protection without degrading protection against Gravity Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) up to 9 Gz.  JSAM TA will integrate with essential aircraft subsystems.  

The JSAM-JSF is a CB respirator being specifically designed to support the F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) and procured by the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office.  It is designed to ensure that system integration and qualification of CB protection and survivability requirements are achieved as derived from the JSF Operational Requirements Document.  When integrated with aircraft and pilot mounted equipment, the JSAM-JSF will provide combined CB, hypoxia and anti-G protection to all F-35 users, including the USAF, USN, USMC, and International Partners.  

(2) Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE) Family of Systems (FoS).  UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users with individual percutaneous protective equipment allowing the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will seek to address the broader scope of the UIPE Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), to include protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear/Toxic Industrial Material threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  

In FY19, CBRN Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 2 (UIPE 2) will be moved under CBRN Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS).  The UIPE Increment 2 is being transitioned to UIPE FoS because the program will have more than one solution to meet the Warfighters needs.  This is reflected in not only the name change but in the structure of the program.  Instead of the program being driven towards meeting individual Service needs, the program is designed to meet mission area needs.  There are four Mission Areas: Land, Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS solutions will seek to fulfill.

The acquisition strategy allows for multiple decision points throughout product development, which provides flexibility to accelerate mature commercial-off the-shelf/non-developmental item solutions and fully develop less mature solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK ROTARY WING (JSAM RW)

The JSAM RW was developed under a competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract, that included JSAM Apache and JSAM Apache Block III.  A sole source Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) contract was awarded for LRIP.  A Fixed Price modification to the sole source LRIP contract awarded June 2017 to complete USAF and initiate USA Total Package Fielding (TPF).  A competitive Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract with Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs will be pursued for Full Rate Production (FRP).  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract will also include Cost Plus CLINS for the vendor to establish a production line at Pine Bluff Arsenal.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK STRATEGIC AIRCRAFT (JSAM SA)

The JSAM SA acquisition approach involves modifying the fielded M53 ground mask design in order to add Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA), up to 40,000 feet above sea-level, and middle ear equalization capabilities.  The JSAM SA mask is intended to be fielded to the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), and United States Army (USA).  The Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

The overall acquisition strategy is to initially produce and field the JSAM SA masks incrementally.  This approach allows the JSAM SA mask to be fielded to aircrew of the most applicable aircrafts in the shortest amount of time.  At the end of all increments, the Services will have achieved their Full Operating Capability (FOC).  The first increment will consist of fielding the JSAM SA mask to the USAF E-3 and USN P-8 aircrew.  Based on technical difficulty and mission need, the JSAM SA program will work with the Services to determine which aircraft will be addressed in subsequent increments.

The overall test strategy involves four major phases.  The first test phase consists of Design Verification Testing (DVT) which will evaluate developmental prototype masks prior to Critical Design Review (CDR).  The second test phase is Developmental Testing (DT) to support Milestone C/LRIP.  The third test phase is Operational Testing (OT) of assets to support Initial Operating Capability (IOC) fielding to USAF E-3, USN P-8, USA MC-12, and USA UC-35 aircrew.  The final test phase will consist of Integration and Airworthiness Certification (I&amp;AC) testing for all remaining aircraft.

The contract strategy consists of two sole-source contracts with Avon Protection Systems, the manufacturer of the fielded M53 mask.  The first contract, which was awarded on 31 July 2013, covers all activities during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to include all LRIP builds.  The second contract, which is planned to be awarded after Milestone C, will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment (PD) phase including all FRP builds.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK TACTICAL AIRCRAFT (JSAM TA)

The JSAM TA acquisition approach involves modifying the USN/USMC fielded A/P22P-14A series respirator design to meet aircraft integration requirements.  The test strategy involves integrated testing (combined DT/OT) to be completed prior to MS C/FRP.  The contract strategy consists of two sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts with Cam Lock, Ltd.  Aldershot Hampshire, United Kingdom.  The first contract, awarded September 2016, covers all activities during the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The second contract will be a sole source FFP Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) and is planned for award after the Milestone C/FRP.  The second contract will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment phase including FRP builds.  The JSAM TA mask is intended to be fielded to the USAF, USN, and USMC.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER (JSAM-JSF)

JSAM-JSF is specifically designed for the F-35 (Joint Strike Fighter) to be incorporated within the JSF platform and fielded to USAF, USN, USMC and international partners.  JSAM-JSF is being developed concurrently with other JSF equipment including life support and pilot flight equipment.  JSAM-JSF initially leveraged a Joint Service Aircrew Mask- Fixed Wing (JSAM-FW) design and shared the same base contract with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee delivery order.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

The UIPE Increment 2 will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The acquisition strategy allows for multiple decision points throughout product development, which provides flexibility to accelerate mature commercial-off the-shelf/non-developmental item solutions and fully develop less mature solutions.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  Pre-Milestone A activities included the exploration of available state of the art technologies through market research, Requests for Information, and a challenge competition; shaping realistic requirements by exploring trade space of novel technologies; and identified protection offered by non-chemical biological (CB) combat gear.  The Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase will reduce technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk.  During this phase, the program will focus on forming mission profile areas designed to narrow the focus of solutions designed specifically for a certain Warfighter functional area.  Early testing will aide in deciding what is possible for each mission profile area and feed information into the trade space analysis.  Developmental/Operational Testing will assess the ability of the solution to meet requirements, demonstrate system technical performance in accordance with the operational requirements, and demonstrate performance in realistic conditions.  An Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach will be used to procure informational white papers during the TMRR phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (UIPE FOS)

The UIPE Family of Systems (FoS) will use an evolutionary acquisition strategy to develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles (Land, Sea, Air and Homeland Defense) with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  Pre-Milestone A activities included the exploration of available state of the art technologies through market research, Requests for Information, and a challenge competition; shaping realistic requirements by exploring trade space of novel technologies; and identified protection offered by non-chemical biological (CB) combat gear.  The Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase will reduce technology, engineering, integration, and life-cycle cost risk.

The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.  Once Milestone B is achieved for the Family of Systems each mission profile will be broken out onto their own budget lines.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN-IS); (2) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (3) Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (4) Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); and (5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

CBRN-IS is an enterprise solution that provides End to End easily accessible sets of CBRN Enterprise capabilities through web services utilizing Service Oriented Architecture.  Provides timely, fused, and easily accessible CBRN defense information to the Joint warfighter, CBDP community of interest, civil and international partners.  CBRN-IS provides a collaborative environment that allows users to collect and disseminate CBRN warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time.  CBRN-IS provides an environment that supports the implementation of Integrated Early Warning (IEW) capabilities that allow users to access netted sensor information, data fusion, disease modeling, biosurveillance data, source term estimation data, incident management tools, and planning and analysis capabilities.  CBRN-IS provides net centric, cloud based tools and capabilities that are aligned with the current and future DoD IT/Cyber computing environments including Army Common Operating Environment (COE) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  The CBRN-IS enterprise makes CBRN decision aids readily accessible from any desktop through a standard web browser simplifying interoperability, reducing integration and deployment costs and increases cybersecurity protection.  

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the DoD with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on versions of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides, such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  JEM will also allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited DoD warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document (CDD) released early in the program.  "Agile Software Development" is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development. 

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. 

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program addresses USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability
Development Document (IS CDD).  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of
the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance
domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early
identification and response to biological events.  BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental
officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP
does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a
centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources.

The BSP Program will utilize BA5 funding to execute the development, testing and evaluation of capabilities to meet the defined program requirements.  There will
be two Production Capability Drops (CDs) and two Engineering CDs in FY18.  CDs will be evaluated following Developmental Testing (DT) through End-to-End Testing using users to validate delivered capability as part of the IT Box process thus reducing risk to the program and ensure a quality product is delivered to the warfighter.

As software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  BSP, JEM, and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN Warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014.  The BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs).  There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016.  A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN-IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple programs of record capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment.  CBRN-IS enterprise will initially integrate appropriate JPEO-CBD products into a FoS framework beginning with the Joint Warning and Reporting (JWARN) and Joint Effects Model (JEM) program capabilities.  CBRN-IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense.  The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating the inclusion of mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing advanced technology demonstrations (ATD) and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD).  CBRN-IS utilizes the Agile software development process with the IT Box acquisition strategy to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

It is anticipated JEM 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN-IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-3 and RDP-4 prior to contract completion. 

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN integrator, a follow-on contract Request for Proposal (RFP) is targeted for release Q4 FY17 with a targeted award date of Q3 FY18.  The follow-on contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JWARN follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN software development and maintenance contract.

It is anticipated JWARN 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

The Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the DBPAP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of new materials and information into MCM development.  

The Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID Tx) program is developing and will deliver a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, broad-spectrum medical countermeasure to the Warfighter for protection against naturally occurring or biologically engineered viruses.  The first indication being pursued is influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The product in development failed during phase 3 clinical trials as a result the flu effort is being terminated.  The development of a broad spectrum medical countermeasure will continue under the Antiviral Therapeutic program.  

The Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures.

The Antiviral Therapeutic Program (AV TX) will develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter.  Drug products will be developed targeting the pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, such as Ebola.  This includes viruses of interest from the following families: Filoviridae, Alphaviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.  Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter.  In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation. 

Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT) will leverage platform technologies to streamline the MCM delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risk and a subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats.  The first platform being established as part of an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT).  A second platform technology will be established which will focus on a vaccine platform capability.  The Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs.  To achieve this goal the DOD is establishing a medical countermeasures platform (MCMPT) capability.  The goal of the MCMPT is to counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will center on leveraging the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and developing robust manufacturing processes.  

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) threat, and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance.  NGDS 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care.  NGDS 2 will provide additional capability for diagnosis of CBR-induced diseases, suitable for use in far forward environments.

The DoD provides for the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these BW agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B, Plague, and Next Generation Anthrax vaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products for the Recombinant Botulinum A/B, Plague, and Next Generation Anthrax vaccine programs using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.

The DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the Special Immunizations Program (SIP) conducting research on these diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  BA5 Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing.  The early stage efforts (BA4) are to develop standardized design capabilities to support a rapid response.  Once established, future programs will be able to leverage this capability for the development of specific medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority through the medical OTA consortium.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B Program develops MCMs for MDR (multi-drug resistant) bacteria, including BWAs and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  To meet the requirement to prevent or minimize the effects from MDR Bacterial exposures, the CMDR-B program will follow an integrated product development process and undergo independent regulatory affairs processes to achieve an FDA approved drug.  The CMDR-B program is establishing collaborative relationships with DoD, other USG entities, and commercial partners in order to populate the MDR pipeline which will help reduce program risk, potentially lower program cost, and accelerate delivery of MCMs to the Warfighter.  Leveraging collaborative Department of Defense (DoD), United States Government, and industry efforts will reduce program risk, lower program cost, and accelerate the delivery of therapeutics to the Warfighter.  The program has established a translational team with the Joint Science and Technology Office for animal model work and pipeline candidates that could transition to CMDR-B for Advanced Development.  The CMDR-B program also has a partnership with DHHS/BARDA to manufacture developmental drug product that will support an Interim Fielding Capability for a plague therapeutic for post-exposure protection and treatment.  The CMDR-B program intends to have a Milestone B Decision Review in 1QFY19.  Results from the program investment in Non-Human Primate Pivotal efficacy testing, conducted in TMRR phase, in FY17 may result in Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 mature candidates being ready for further development.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS program was a MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 will replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and concepts of employment (COEs) that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address.  More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care.  NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities.  Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements.  Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards under the medical Other Transactions Authority (OTA), to take advantage of non-traditional Defense contractor offerings.

CRITICAL REAGENTS PROGRAM (CRP)

The Critical Reagents Program's (CRP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.  This program will transition to the Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP) in FY18.

DEFENSE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS ASSURANCE PROGRAM (DBPAP)

The Defense Biological Products Assurance Program's (DBPAP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) and detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES - THERAPUTIC (EID TX)

The goal of the EID Tx program is to develop a safe and effective MCM against biothreats of interest to the DoD.  The first step of the acquisition strategy is to develop an MCM for influenza due to a clear and established FDA regulatory approval pathway.  The Phase 2 clinical trial is complete, demonstrating both safety and efficacy in humans.  Program was authorized by FDA to move forward at End of Phase 2 meeting on 3 SEP 13.  Phase 3 clinical trials for EID Tx against influenza began during 1QFY14.  The MCM was unsuccessful in the Phase 3 clinical trials, removing the expectation of FDA approval.  In June 2016, the recommendation was made to end the EID - Flu product development contract and transition the program to AV Tx.  It was determined that the influenza product, Favipiravir, would not meet contract requirements and program key performance parameters.  The FDA informed the sponsor that the product under development did not provide a clinically significant benefit and was unlikely to be approved for the current indication.  As a result, the program will package select data while removing all non-essential activities, allowing the contract to end with the current PoP in March 2017.  The requirement for a broad-spectrum Antiviral will continue under the AV Tx Program.

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The acquisition strategy combined the Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (HFV) and Emerging Infectious Diseases Therapeutics (EID TX) Program efforts beginning in FY17, into a single program to develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral countermeasures.  Independent market research conducted in FY15 identified multiple candidates appropriate for advanced development at varying stages of maturity.  A source selection was conducted targeting award in FY16.  The candidate selected for entry into the EMD phase of development will be executed under the Antiviral Therapeutic program in FY17.  The candidate selected for entry into the TMRR phase will be deferred for award until FY17 when BA4 funding is available to the program.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of a products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct human clinical safety studies, pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies, required for FDA approval.  The performers will submit New Drug Applications/Biologic License Agreements for the therapeutics during the EMD Phase.

BOTULINUM VACCINE (VAC BOT)

The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule has been completed.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population.  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application (BLA) is be submitted to the FDA including all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

NEXT GENERATION ANTHRAX VACCINE (VAC NGA)

The Next Generation Anthrax vaccine program strategy supports the development and qualification of immunological assays and required reference materials to support potential future anthrax vaccine programs.  Once qualified, these assays will provide the DOD with data to support future decisions related to the anthrax pre-exposure vaccine program.

PLAGUE VACCINE (VAC PLG)

The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  In order to reduce technical program risk in the Plague vaccine program, the program office conducted competitive prototyping between a US vaccine candidate and a United Kingdom vaccine candidate.  During the 2008 Resource Allocation Decision, the US Plague Vaccine candidate was selected for development through licensure under a Prime System Contract.  The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) currently functions as the FDA regulatory sponsor and performs all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  A Project Arrangement is in place with the United Kingdom and Canada.  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population and evaluation of efficacy and duration of protection in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule .  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application will be submitted to the FDA with all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary to provide an effective capability for medical defense against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. forces in the field.  This project supports efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  Project provides for the research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  This program currently includes: (1) Alternative Autoinjector (AUTOINJ), which consists of investigating an FDA approved alternative source(s), beyond the single current DoD source, for autoinjectors that deliver DoD nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the warfighter; mitigates capability fielding and operational readiness risks.  This resulted from the manufacturing and quality issues for the fielded ATNAA product, the oxime (2-PAM) and atropine in a dual chambered autoinjector.  (2) The Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS), consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems; (3) Bioscavenger - Plasma (BSCAV-P), a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents; (4) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) an enhanced chemical warfare nerve agent treatment regimen consisting of an improved oxime to replace the current fielded oxime 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM), a centrally acting therapeutic to increase survival, and non-clinical studies to demonstrate the safety of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a pretreatment for nerve agents in addition to soman.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ALTERNATE AUTOINJECTOR MANUFACTURER CAPABILITY (AUTOINJ)

The Alternative Autoinjector Investigation will identify an alternative source(s) to develop, and provide required and FDA approved autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the services.  Currently, a single DoD source provides all of these capabilities.  That single source is experiencing manufacturing and quality issues leading to risk that the services may not meet their operational requirements.  This effort leverages previous work begun under the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS) autoinjector-delivered product wherein the single manufacturer notified the AAS program office that the FDA had noted manufacturing and quality issues which impacted the AAS program as well as all other DoD autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidotes and treatments.  At that time, the AAS program began investigating alternative sources through the release of a request for Information (RFI).  Subsequent to the RFI, the AAS program awarded a task order under an existing IDIQ contract vehicle to begin the identification efforts.  As this issue is well beyond the scope of the AAS program and impacts all developmental and fielded autoinjector-delivered capabilities, the Joint Program Executive Office, Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) approved the strategy to expand the alternative autoinjector effort beyond AAS, thus initiating a new effort benefiting both fielded and developmental capabilities.  The JPEO-CBD also approved the management and oversight of the effort via a series of In-Process Reviews (IPRs).  The effort will proceed through the submission of a New Drug Application and will culminate with FDA approval of an alternative autoinjector source(s).

ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM (AAS)

The Advanced Anticonvulsant System, consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional nerve agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

A contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the SDD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.

BIOSCAVENGER (BSCAV)

Used a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase which culminated in a down-select decision.  The Bioscavenger program issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase the program will continue to exercise management oversight with system integration support of a commercial partner to ensure that manufacturing of the product is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines.  Prior to FDA licensure, a commercial partner will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, definitive animal efficacy studies, and toxicology studies.  The system integrator will also develop and manufacture a product formulation and product packaging and will submit a Biologics License Application and seek FDA approval.  The SDD phase will culminate in FDA licensure of the Bioscavenger.  During the Production and Deployment phase, the Bioscavenger-Plasma (BSCAV-P) program, in conjunction with a commercial partner, will pursue full rate production.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.  Concurrently the Bioscavenger program will conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, investigate additional product indications, and pursue an expanded force prophylaxis once alternate technologies have matured.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

The INATS' evolutionary Acquisition Strategy has expanded to insert a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent.  This strategy employs an incremental approach to provide independent, and more rapid development and delivery in a combined treatment regimen of (1) an improved oxime, and (2) CA capabilities, and to evaluate safety of PB when treating exposure of other traditional and novel organophosphorous nerve agents.  In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, close collaborations will occur with the science/ technology, and user communities to assess technical viability, capability delivery options, and to refine operational concepts; the Government will be the systems integrator overseeing the conduct of oxime and centrally acting formulation development efforts, nonclinical toxicology and efficacy studies, clinical safety studies, and nonclinical studies to evaluate safety of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) when used to counter other traditional and novel organophosphorus nerve agents.  In the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase for the oxime and CA components, the Government will engage with commercial partner(s) to ensure that INATS development and manufacture is in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines; the commercial partner(s) will perform a Phase 2 human clinical safety study, nonclinical toxicology studies and definitive animal efficacy studies; the commercial partner(s) will also oversee the manufacture of improved oxime and CA formulations and delivery system that is stable under operationally relevant temperatures.  The Government will submit a New Drug Application and seek FDA approval for the INATS products.  In the Production and Deployment (P&amp;D) Phase, the Government will pursue full-rate and stockpile production, conduct any FDA mandated post-marketing surveillance studies, and will transfer contracting/ logistical responsibilities to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) while remaining to monitor program performance through disposal as the life-cycle manager.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) Product Director, Test, Equipment, Strategy, and Support (PD TESS).  Budget Item will continue as Chem Bio Material Assessment Infrastructure (CBMAI) beginning in fiscal year 2019.  PD TESS/CBMAI provides test infrastructure products for testing and evaluating chemical and biological defense systems throughout the life cycle acquisition process.  PD TESS/CBMAI products are aligned in two groups to include: (1) Laboratory; (2) Field.  The program name changed to highlight the Assessment function, which includes: analysis and analytical products conducted in support of infrastructure improvements.
(1) Laboratory: The products for this area are the Non-Traditional Agent Defense Test System (NTADTS) improvements and the Dynamic Test Chamber (DTC).  The NTADTS provides a new capability to conduct chemical defense testing against current and emerging threat agents.  The NTADTS supports testing of decontamination, collective protection, individual protection, and contamination avoidance products.  The DTC provides a new capability for testing chemical point detection systems against chemical warfare agents in various environmental conditions.  The CBD acquisition programs supported are Aerosol-Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) (formerly Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD 1)), Proximity Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2), Multiphase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3), Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) (formerly NGCD 4), Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipes (JSEW), and Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS).  Future efforts will include the development of test methods and methodologies for additional classes of agents.

(2) Field: The products for this area are Test Grid, Open Architecture Data Management System (OADMS), Joint Ambient Breeze Tunnel (JABT) and Active Standoff Chamber (ASC).  The Test Grid effort provides a fully instrumented grid for chemical and biological simulant field test capabilities that integrate referee systems; dissemination equipment; real-time cloud tracking capability; meteorological equipment; a wireless network; and a Data Management System (DMS) software to track and display the simulant cloud; and provide status of all of the equipment in the network at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  The OADMS is an open architecture all-inclusive mobile management service functioning wirelessly, capable of integrating, controlling, commanding and managing all assets required to conduct chemical and biological (CB) tests at any Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  It provides algorithms and graphical user interfaces for automating real-time visualization, raw data, computation, hosts data collection and indefinite storage that can go to any MRTFB for CB Testing.  The JABT and ASC improvements will provide a tech refresh to existing infrastructure and allow establishment of test data correlation between laboratory-tunnels-field for test results.  The Multi Commodity Agent Chamber (MCAC) is an agent chamber that will be configurable for use by multiple commodities with emphasis placed on CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotic Platforms (C-SIRP).  The CBD acquisition programs supported are the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP), Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD), Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE), CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotic Platforms (C-SIRP), and the Joint USFK Point and Integrated Threat Recognition (JUPITR) Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD).

Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Budget Activity includes research, development, testing and evaluation management support for the Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).

Program Element 0605384BP supports Joint Doctrine and Training (Project DT6), sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) (Project DW6); sustains the core Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory infrastructure (Project LS6), provides for program management and financial management support (Project MS6), and supports the Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis (JCSA) program (Project O49).  

The Joint Training and Doctrine Support (DT6) project supports the development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also supports CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

The Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as "national assets".  These assets are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD test and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to commercial and other users on a reimbursable basis.  WDTC is designated as the primary element of the MRTFB to primarily conduct CB Defense test and evaluation.  The DW6 Project provides operating support to WDTC and BTB-ECBC, also part of the MRTFB, to ensure that DoD test customers are only charged direct costs of testing and that overhead expenses are centrally funded.  It finances the required institutional test operating costs.  Institutional test operating costs include institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment.

The Laboratory Support (LS6) project includes laboratory infrastructure to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

The management support (MS6) project, provides management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense Programs (DATSD(CBD)); funds management by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); Development, coordination, and approval of joint CBRND requirements, management of multi-service and joint CBRND doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures; training, leader development, education, exercises, and development of the CBDP Program Objective Memorandum (POM) by the Joint Requirements Office; Joint RDA planning, input to the Annual Report to Congress and Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO); review of Joint plans and the consolidated CB Defense POM Strategy by Army in its Executive Agent role.  

The management support project also includes the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive mission to establish test infrastructure investment strategy and adequate testing for Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical Biological Defense (CBD) systems and components throughout the systems' acquisition life cycle, as required in the RDA Plan under the Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program.  The JTIWG program includes T&amp;E Early Involvement, test threat planning, Fielded Equipment Assessments, T&amp;E studies, and T&amp;E Standards planning and development to support testing the CBD systems for all services to include radiological, nuclear, medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis (JCSA) program (Project O49) project supports the planning, conduct, evaluation, and reporting on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.

This Budget Activity also provides for Program Element 0605502BP, which supports the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program.  The overall objective of the CBD SBIR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a CB environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include CB detection; information assessment (identification, modeling, and intelligence); contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $5.573 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides the technical and operational capability for testing Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological (CB) and Non Traditional Agent (NTA) defense materiel, equipment, and systems from concept through production to include associated special operations Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Development (TTPD) activities at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), and the Biological Test Branch of the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (BTB-ECBC), both part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) located at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC and BTB-ECBC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).

WDTC and BTB-ECBC are the reliance centers for all DoD CB defense testing and provide the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).

WDTC and BTB-ECBC use state-of-the-art chemical and life sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data is generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.

The Secretary of the Army has been directed to conduct additional research addressing existing gaps in scientific knowledge encompassing the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Program.  The transition of the Bio-Testi Branch (BTB) to Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) will enable the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program to meet end to end enterprise tracking, reporting, and auditability requirements within an approved Governance, Risks, and Compliance framework.  The laboratory commanders and directors are best able to identify potential risk through the use of local risk assessments and are responsible to promote cultures of safety and responsibility.  Direct liaison with and oversight by the Executive Agent Responsible Officer will ensure laboratory directors or MRTFB commander are empowered and supported in their operational environment.  The ultimate responsibility for the safe and secure receipt, storage, handling, shipment and transfer of BSAT resides with the laboratory director or MRTFB commander in accordance with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Federal policies and regulations.  The implementation of a structured BSAT Biosafety Program includes clear standards and procedures, policy and regulations, peer review, quality control, accountability and oversight, adequate resources and infrastructure, and continuous process improvement.  Through these means employees and members of the public are protected against the hazards associated with BSAT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides management support for the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).  It includes program oversight and integration of overall non-CBRN Defense Equipment (non-CDE) and CBRN Defense Equipment (CDE) programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)) and defense programs through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense (DASD(CBD)).  Funds execution management is provided by DTRA. 

The project also provides for the development, coordination and integration of Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defense capability requirements, including assistance and support to the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Services to improve CBRN defense related doctrine, education, training, and awareness by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); preparation of Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents in accordance with Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction CJCSI 3170.01I dated 23 January 2015; Joint CBRN Defense Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) planning; input to the CBD Annual Report to Congress; and program guidance development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO).

The Biological Select Agent and Toxin (BSAT) Biosafety Program Office (BBPO) will advise the Executive Agent Responsible Official (EA RO) for the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program on biosafety and all matters that pertain to risk associated with BSAT operations, provide oversight of DoD BSAT laboratory biosafety operations, serve as a unified DoD interface with external regulatory agencies, ensure safety and standardization of procedures used in DoD BSAT laboratories, and identify industry-wide best practices to enhance biosafety across the full spectrum of DoD BSAT operations.  As the EA RO for BSAT the program is tasked with technical review, inspection, and harmonization of biosafety protocols and procedures across DoD laboratories that handle BSAT.  As such, the program manages the Biosafety and Scientific Review Panel, inspection of DoD laboratories, harmonization of DoD BSAT-related regulations and procedures, coordinating interaction and information with the CDC, establishing a Defense Business System to track and manage BSAT across DoD, providing laboratory biosafety oversight, and advancing BSAT-related scientific research to address knowledge gaps.  This office was established in March 2016 and prior to FY 2018 is funded within the OSD Management line.

The project includes programming support for the Joint Service CB Information System (JSCBIS) which serves as a budgetary and informational database for the DoD CBDP.  Also included within the project is financial management services to include fund distribution, execution reporting, and fiscal financial statements.

This project also supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive, who is responsible for the planning, balancing, and oversight of test infrastructure and test technology requirements to support Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of DoD CBRND systems, as outlined in the RDA Plan.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the Enterprise processes to develop and sustain standardized T&amp;E methodologies and validated instrumentation and infrastructure to ensure the adequacy of test for CBRND systems in alignment with acquisition milestones and associated decision points.  The Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program supports T&amp;E Early Involvement; test threat planning; T&amp;E studies; and T&amp;E standards planning and development to support CBRND testing for all Services to include medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The CBRND T&amp;E Executive directly supports OSD T&amp;E oversight of acquisition programs and provides the mechanism for early T&amp;E involvement in the acquisition process.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive provides the T&amp;E infrastructure investment strategy and coordinates investment planning and T&amp;E capabilities validation among the Joint Service Community to ensure that program needs are met.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the T&amp;E processes to ensure end to end feedback loops to support to the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating Government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet Government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the Government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs.  2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program provides the technology upgrade and refresh effort for the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS).  The program supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. 

The CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) consists of portable, commercial and Government off-the-shelf equipment which provides personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards through detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting for CBRN and emerging threats.  This project provides the technology upgrade and refresh effort for the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) to address and mitigate technology/equipment obsolescence.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

CA4 The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) Inc 2 program will provide an Advanced Capabilities Set (ACS) for use by Joint Technical Forces in sensitive site assessment, exploitation and elimination missions in conjunction with their existing baseline CBRN DRS Inc1 system.  The ACS will be comprised of Government (GOTS) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment to the greatest extent possible.  Requirements analysis will support Materiel Development Decision and provide guidance for the Analysis of Material Approaches (AoMA) to identify potential solutions.  Efforts will culminate in an approved Capabilities Development Document and a Milestone B.  Contracting efforts will be initiated under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production contract mechanism.  The contract will cover a base period of performance for development/integration with options for Low-Rate and Full Rate Production (FRP).

CA7 The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a government-off-the-shelf (GOTS)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to a full capability.  This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, well-managed acquisition program.  CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor production facilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COMMON ANALYTICAL LABORATORY SYSTEM (CALS)

The Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) will be developed leveraging both Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) analytical components to support the identification of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Non-traditional agent materials in environmental samples technology.  The (CALS) program is designed to provide an affordable, modular, scalable and sustainable field analytic capability that can be readily transported to meet the mission profile and requirements of the gaining organization.  CALS will consist of (3) variants which will be fielded, in accordance with mission need, to components of the Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy and National Guard Bureau requiring CBRN field confirmatory analytical detection capability.  Post Milestone B (FY15), a hybrid contract (CPIF / FPI / FFP) was awarded to develop, design and build these system variant prototypes in order to conduct developmental test (DT) and evaluation.  The Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Set (FC ACS) entered DT first and to reached an early Milestone C - Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) (FY17) followed by a Full Rate Production (FRP) Decision prior to the Milestone C (LRIP) (FY19) and (FRP) Decision for the FC (1st Quarter, FY20) and TV Integrated Systems.  After each Milestone C, contracts will be awarded to produce the (3) variants of the Common Analytical Laboratory System using Fixed Price (FP) Contract vehicles.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the upgrade and modernization of Collective Protection (CP) equipment and systems including Modernization Protection (MODPROT) for fielded CP systems and Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP). 

MODPROT provides upgrades, improvements and modernizations to fielded Collective Protection Systems such as the Chemical and Biological Protective Shelter, Shipboard Collective Protection Systems, Fixed Site Collective Protection Systems, M20A1 Simplified Collective Protection Equipment, Modular Collective Protection Equipment systems, and Collectively Protected Field Hospitals.  Funding increases the Collective Protection System Backfit program M98 filter set life extension, and identifies and tests replacements for obsolete M93 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) components used in numerous hard shelter systems.  The M93 GPFU improvements also address current electromagnetic interference requirements.  MODPROT also addresses obsolescence issues in test quality standards for gas filters and tests sealants and coatings to mitigate corrosion on filter systems to extend service life of these systems.

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone CP systems and kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits to provide other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.  Funding will develop a field leakage test capability that allows Warfighters to validate the integrity of JECP and other fielded collective protection systems, integrate newly developed filtration material into existing M98 Gas Particulate Filter Sets to provide the Warfighter with improved protection against toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials while maintaining current performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents and meeting military standards, develop a CP kit for non-CP environmental control units and improve on the current tent liner restraint systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

Modernizing Collective Protection leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded collective protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.



JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Production and Deployment Phases of the program.  Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 under the current Leidos contract to meet Initial Operational Capability.  A competitive build-to-print follow-on production task order under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition, and Production (JE-RDAP) Contract will be awarded in FY19 to support production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC).  Phase 2 systems will be developed starting in FY18 as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate JE-RDAP competitive task order and will undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision in FY21.  Production options will be included in the task order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems.  Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS.  BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various environmental control unit types for use with collective protection.  These efforts involve a simplified acquisition procurement contract and exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.  BA7 product development and testing will continue through FY19 with an expectation to achieve production readiness at the end of FY19.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Modernizing Decontamination leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded decontamination systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modernize Individual Protection (MODPROT) addresses obsolescence issues with Individual Protective equipment and the need to modernize the Joint Services fielded chemical and biological protection with capabilities meeting or exceeding the Services requirements.  

MODPROT will modernize current chemical protective footwear by conducting 1) Limited User Evaluation (LUE) in support of the Alternative Source Qualification plan for a suitable replacement to the Alternative Footwear Solutions (AFS) and 2) modernizing the Integrated Footwear System (IFS).  MODPROT will also conduct a modernization effort of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) Block 1 Glove Upgrade Flame Resistant (JB1GU FR) glove, and reverse engineering of maintenance and repair procedures for the Joint Services Mask Leakage Tester (JSMLT).

JSGPM provides for filter modernization and enhancements against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) on the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM).  Filter upgrades will be provided for fielded Protection systems to enhance respiratory and ocular protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

Modernize Individual Protection, as part of the Alternative Source Qualification test and evaluation approach, conducts an evaluation of the Moulded Airboss Lightweight Overboot (MALO) as a potential substitute to the Alternative Footwear Solutions (AFS) CBRN Protective Overboot.  Part of this evaluation includes a performance assessment of the MALO physical properties relative to the AFS and its performance requirements.  MODPROT will also conduct an evaluation of the stretchy Integrated Footwear System (IFS) as a potential substitute for the current version of the IFS CBRN Protective sock.



JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the two M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  As filter technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the media and the layered bed design requires maturing to an MRL level 9.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the filter, the production transition to the new improved filter has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems including the Biosurveillance Portal (BSP), the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This project also provides for the Software Support Activity (SSA) and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN-IS).  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs.

Efforts included in this project are: (1) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN-IS); (2) Joint Effects Model (JEM); (3) Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN); (4) Biosurveillance Portal (BSP); and (5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

CBRN-IS is an enterprise solution that provides End to End easily accessible sets of CBRN Enterprise capabilities through web services utilizing Service Oriented Architecture.  Provides timely, fused, and easily accessible CBRN defense information to the Joint warfighter, CBDP community of interest, civil and international partners.  CBRN-IS provides a collaborative environment that allows users to collect and disseminate CBRN warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time.  CBRN-IS provides an environment that supports the implementation of Integrated Early Warning (IEW) capabilities that allow users to access netted sensor information, data fusion, disease modeling, biosurveillance data, source term estimation data, incident management tools, and planning and analysis capabilities.  CBRN-IS provides net centric, cloud based tools and capabilities that are aligned with the current and future DoD IT/Cyber computing environments including Army Common Operating Environment (COE) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  The CBRN-IS enterprise makes CBRN decision aids readily accessible from any desktop through a standard web browser simplifying interoperability, reducing integration and deployment costs and increases cybersecurity protection.

The Joint Effects Model (JEM) is a web-based software application that supplies the DoD with the one and only accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents.  JEM is capable of providing all warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects.  JEM supports planning to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

Follow-on versions of JEM will refine and display hazard areas in near real time to reflect inputs such as meteorological, oceanographic, or actual agent concentration data.  JEM will automatically receive input data from the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system on which it resides, such as historical climatology, local observations, weather forecasts, natural environmental threats (i.e.: pandemic influenza, etc.), terrain data, intelligence information, or population data.  JEM will also allow manual user input for factors such as concentrations of chemical warfare agents or actual exposure measurements and forecast sheltering stay-times and provide for modeling sheltering time through user-defined scenarios.

The Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) is an accredited DoD warning and reporting system that provides a standardized warning and reporting capability for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) incidents.  

JWARN supports the Joint Force Commander (JFC) by improving force protection capabilities for units operating in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear environments.  JWARN provides a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the Common Operational Picture, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command.  JWARN will be operated by CBRN and non-CBRN trained personnel operating in the operations center at various command nodes.  This provides commanders with situational awareness to inform decision making for force protection criteria, unmasking operations, decontamination, and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.  Future sensor configurations will forward sensor inputs directly to JWARN via established communication lanes, removing the man-in-the-loop requirement with the current system configuration.  JWARN will be information system classification agnostic and must be able to operate on unclassified, secret, top secret, and mission partner IT Systems without increasing system operator requirement, i.e.: sensor to COP via one communication loop.  As a result, sensors will then be able to communicate with JWARN on the same network, regardless of classification.

JEM and JWARN utilize the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual prescribed Information Technology Box (IT Box) construct for managing requirements for the follow-on increments of capability development.  The "IT Box" is an acquisition approach and methodology regarding how software systems should be developed and fielded.  It is a process that differs from the way DoD acquires hardware systems.  The acquisition approach uses the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) to describe the required operational capabilities for the entire development effort.  These overarching requirements are further broken out into Requirements Definition Packages (RDPs) released over the life of the product instead of a single Capability Development Document (CDD) released early in the program.  "Agile Software Development" is a set of industry standard software development methods used in conjunction with the IT Box framework.  Agile Software Development promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.  The Agile methodology is an alternative to traditional program management, typically used in software development.  It helps teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences, known as sprints.  Agile methodologies are an alternative to waterfall, or traditional sequential development. 

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort. 

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) was a FY 2016 new start program to address USSOCOM requirements contained in an approved Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD).  BSP is a web-based enterprise environment that will facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological events.  BSP bridges the communication gaps in the biosurveillance domain to provide a central access point for biosurveillance information and situational awareness for DoD, interagency and allied partners supporting the early identification and response to biological events.  BSP provides an integrated suite of web-based components designed to support public health officers, environmental officers, clinicians, physicians, and CBRN personnel as they maintain their situational awareness of local, regional, and global biological threats to the force.  BSP does not duplicate existing DoD capabilities, but rather leverages existing tools and technologies to provide users across multiple organizations and disciplines with a centralized "one-stop shop" for all of their biosurveillance resources.

The BSP Program will utilize BA7 funding to execute modernization, bug fixes, provide support at the fielded locations and maintain training.  There will be two Production Capability Drops (CDs) and two Engineering CDs in FY18.  CDs will be evaluated following Developmental Testing (DT) through End-to-End Testing using users to validate delivered capability as part of the IT Box process thus reducing risk to the program and ensuring a quality product is delivered to the warfighter.

As software-intensive systems, JEM, JWARN, and BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components.  BSP, JEM, and JWARN are designated as ACAT III programs and unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.  

The Software Support Activity (SSA) is a Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the warfighter.  The SSA provides the CBRN warfighter with Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA emphasizes development of reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies and direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of biosurveillance and other critical CBRN information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Biosurveillance Portal (BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014.  The BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach.  IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs).  There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016.  A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN-IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple programs of record capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment.  CBRN-IS enterprise will initially integrate appropriate JPEO-CBD products into a FoS framework beginning with the Joint Warning and Reporting (JWARN) and Joint Effects Model (JEM) program capabilities.  CBRN-IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense.  The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating the inclusion of mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing advanced technology demonstrations (ATD) and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD).  CBRN-IS utilizes the Agile software development process with the IT Box acquisition strategy to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

It is anticipated JEM 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN-IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-3 and RDP-4 prior to contract completion. 

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN integrator, a follow-on contract Request for Proposal (RFP) is targeted for release Q4 FY17 with a targeted award date of Q3 FY18.  The follow-on contractor for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2.0 contract.  The JWARN follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN software development and maintenance contract.

It is anticipated JWARN 2 capabilities will transition to CBRN IS in Fiscal Year 2023.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Medical Biological defense equipment/systems including the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) and Next Generation Diagnostic Systems (NGDS).

JBAIDS is a commercial off the shelf system that provides a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types.  By 2005, 16 biological warfare (BW) agent surveillance detection kits were fielded along with the first JBAIDS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay cleared
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  JBAIDS currently has seven IVD kits cleared by the FDA, JBAIDS achieved full operational capability (340 systems delivered all Services) in July 2011. 

The NGDS is an evolutionary acquisition family of systems to provide increments of capability over time across many echelons of the Combat Health Support System.  The mission of the NGDS is to provide Chemical, Biological and Radiological (CBR) threat and infectious disease identification and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment as defined in the approved NGDS Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance as defined in the Common Analytical Laboratory (CALS) CDD.  NGDS Increment 1 will significantly improve diagnostic capability for deployable combat health support units (Role 3) while also improving operational suitability and affordability by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline
of commercial non BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.  The NGDS Increment 1 program successfully achieved MS C Limited Deployment in December 2016. 

FY19, JBAIDS efforts will oversee the configuration management of the system to include program management and monitoring obsolescence.

FY19, NGDS 1 efforts will complete the development of additional assays needed for JBAIDS replacement as well as for additional threat agents (e.g., Alpha Virus, and Orthopox).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT BIO AGENT IDENT AND DIAG SYSTEM (JBAIDS)

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf capability to identify multiple biological agents and other pathogens of operations concern, to include environmental and FDA cleared in vitro diagnostic assays.  JBAIDS also has pre-positioned Emergency Use Authorizations assays for the identification of low probability, high consequence pathogens in clinical samples that can be deployed in the event of a declared health emergency.  The JBAIDS program is preparing for full replacement by NGDS Increment 1 systems, beginning in FY17.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS program was a MS A to MS C - Limited Deployment acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 will replace the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and concepts of employment (COEs) that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address.  More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care.  NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems.  NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities.  Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements.  Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards under the medical Other Transactions Authority (OTA), to take advantage of non-traditional Defense contractor offerings.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

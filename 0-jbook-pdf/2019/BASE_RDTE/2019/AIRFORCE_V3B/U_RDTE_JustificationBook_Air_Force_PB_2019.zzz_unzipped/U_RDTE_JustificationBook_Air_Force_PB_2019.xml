                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of USSTRATCOM is to establish and provide full-spectrum, global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control, Communications, and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.

GSIN directly supports USSTRATCOM's mission. It nets together selected systems and sensors (from tactical to strategic), including the Nation's most modern and capable assets, taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility, and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. Using these traditionally stove-piped systems and sensors, GSIN enables the warfighter in several ways. First it enables creation of a User Defined Operating Picture (UDOP) to provide a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) for effective decision-making. Secondly, it improves Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tapping additional sensor capability.
Thirdly, GSIN dramatically improves the ingestion of non-traditional, but readily available non-US government and commercial data to the space catalog. Finally, the effort addresses several recently signed Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) requests for uninterrupted traditional and non-traditional sensor data integration.

The Nation's strategic C2, sensors, and mission planning programs cannot rapidly exchange information across multiple missions creating ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision making processes. GSIN developed and established a unified schema that integrates disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant and unambiguous MW/MD data to national leadership. GSIN also enables other existing sensors to provide data in net-centric formats consumable by other authorized systems and mission areas, thus reducing the need to acquire more sensors. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) conducts global operations in partnership with other combatant commands, services and U.S. government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the United States.  USSTRATCOM is responsible for command of U.S. nuclear capabilities, space operations, global surveillance and reconnaissance, intelligence, communications, computers, global missile defense and combatting weapons of mass destruction.  To enable completion of these missions, it is recapitalizing the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES).  NPES is a Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff system for nuclear operations and fulfillment of Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) responsibilities.  NPES supports national strategic deterrence by providing a host of NC2 execution activities as well as contingency and crisis action planning capabilities to selected joint and combatant command staffs.  NPES is operated by USSTRATCOM and other specified users performing missions to deter and dissuade threats, and, when directed, defeat adversaries. 
 
The NPES system has evolved from several single-purpose command and control systems over the past 30 years and has reached a point where it requires recapitalization to meet national and strategic objectives and to comply with future concepts of operation. Additionally, recapitalization is needed to improve cybersecurity, system effectiveness, and supportability. Recapitalization will also seek to lower the total cost of ownership and sustainment.  The recapitalization program will use proven/mature software engineering, technologies, and design tenets to provide a modern, secure, interoperable and reliable Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) software capability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NPES weapon system capability. The use of such
program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,
0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program, BA 7, PE 0302015F, project 674777, Survivable SHF, is a new start.

FY18 E-4B Recapitalization efforts are executed under PE0604288F, Project 646507, BA4.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The four (4) aircraft E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) fleet satisfies the military need for an airborne operations center with communications capabilities permitting military and civilian leadership to monitor and control military and civil national assets during all phases of conflict (nuclear and non-nuclear) or natural disaster. The E-4B NAOC fleet also satisfies the military requirement to provide a highly survivable node of the National Military Command System (NMCS). 

This program's developmental modifications include, but are not limited to, upgrades and enhancements to aircraft structures, propulsion system, fuel system, environmental control system, electrical generation and distribution systems, flight safety and navigation systems (with their associated communications equipment). Additionally, modifications may enhance the aircraft's operations center facilities, to include but not limited to those necessary for the Senior Leadership Command, Control and Communications System (SL3CS), National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC), Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) and other communications necessary for the E-4B fleet to execute its mission. Funds may also be used to explore and develop modifications, upgrades, and future systems required to meet evolving mission requirements. Developmental modifications and studies/projects currently underway or planned for accomplishment under this program include:

- The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Compatible Terminal/ Presidential National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) Program integrates AEHF Compatible Command Post Terminals and PNVC capability onto the E-4B NAOC platform. This integration is necessary to replace the legacy Military Strategic, Tactical and Relay (MILSTAR) terminal, and provide access to protected wideband AEHF satellite networks. PNVC replaces the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN), which will not be supported once the AEHF satellite network is in place.

- The Low Frequency Transmit System (LFTS) program replaces the currently installed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Transmit system, which is no longer sustainable after over 35 years of operation. In order to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 requirements and ensure there is assured connectivity between civilian and military leadership and military forces during real world situations, this system must be replaced. The transmit system consists of three primary equipment groups: a Control/Monitor group, a Power Amplifier/Coupler (PA/C) group, and a Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) group.

- The MUOS program upgrades the E-4B's Ultra-High Frequency Radio transmitters to be MUOS capable to meet E-4B Capability Development Document (CDD) and CJCSI 6251_01D requirements.  MUOS provides securable data and full duplex voice communications while simultaneously monitoring a second frequency.  The MUOS upgrade will provide interoperability with MUOS waveforms for voice and data communications and with other nuclear and national C2 centers and aircraft by replacing the legacy USC-42 UHF SATCOM radios with a MUOS capable radio.

- Survivable SHF will upgrade and replace portions of the E-4B's SHF system to meet existing Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-35 and National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20 requirements and to ensure continued connectivity and interoperability as satellite and communications infrastructure evolves.  Expected modifications include, but are not limited to, component and sub-system upgrades and replacement of portions of the current SHF system that are obsolete or near end of service life. A replacement to the SHF system is required as secure, survivable communications capability transitions from the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-4B weapon system capability; furthermore, it may include support funding for emerging modification requirements to support PMA, A&amp;AS, equipment and other as required.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The acquisition strategy for each specific modification differs based on the urgency of the requirement, definition of the capability, and technology readiness level of the components.  

Management Strategy:  Program management for all aircraft modifications is executed by the Commercial Derivative Aircraft Division at Tinker AFB.  The Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Mobility provides management oversight.

Contracting Strategy:  Contracting strategy differs for each individual modification, but normally includes an initial engineering study contract followed by a development contract.  Production installations and sustainment are typically accomplished with the E-4B Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Dem/Val, is an FY19 new start ($25.012M), to be executed in the MEECN System Improvements (MSI) Program 0303131F, Project 672832. In FY20, NC3 Dem/Val efforts will be transferred to Program 0604001F, Project 646020, in order to provide greater transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function. Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements
including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations.

The MEECN portfolio modernizes the systems necessary to effectively provide assured communications connectivity between the President and the strategic deterrence forces in stressed environments.

MSI is a long-range planning process with users (Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and
the Navy) to monitor and assess the performance of NC3 systems and develop recommendations for current and future strategic and tactical architectures, requirements, and issues based on available and emerging technologies. MSI is used to conduct technology testing; analyze technology strategies; conduct requirement trade space analysis, technology maturation and risk reduction efforts, and mission analysis; and build technology Roadmaps as proactive support to the NC3 community. MSI performs analysis, integration, and testing activities for the NC3 Weapon System.

NC3 Dem/Val is required for advanced concept development and prototyping of next generation NC3 systems. This program ensures a responsive design and development engineering infrastructure to address evolving Nuclear Deterrence Operations mission requirements, emerging issues and technology insertion/technology application on the NC3 Weapon System, future strategic systems/capability, and other common strategic areas where appropriate, and develop enhanced multi-use capabilities.  The NC3 Dem/Val Program will provide technology maturation and risk reduction activities to support the NC3 Weapon System (AN/USQ-225).  Activity will reduce life cycle costs, inform technology maturation &amp; risk reduction efforts, improve system performance, mitigate evolving threats, and ensure both viability and durability of the NC3 Weapon System.

Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc. 2 ) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception. The intent of CVR Inc. 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform, to integrate into current and future airborne and ground based platforms, improve system performance, and reduce supportability costs through commonality. The program will also lead the development of the Uniform MEECN Mode (UMM) waveform expected to be used by the United States' Air Force and Navy.

Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).   Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc. 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments.

Global ASNT Inc. 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a replacement Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF)  capabilities. Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Common Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Receiver (CVR) Increment 2 (CVR Inc 2 ) will deliver a survivable, beyond-line-of-sight path for Emergency Action Message (EAM) reception.  The intent of CVR Inc 2 is to develop and produce a common VLF/LF receiver, capable of implementing an interoperable waveform, for future platform integration to include airborne and ground based nodes, improve system performance, and reduce supportability costs through commonality. The program will also lead development of the Unified MEECN Mode (UMM) waveform.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews.  

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments. Global ASNT Increment 1 (Inc 1) includes early system engineering support for the planning and development for the future Global ASNT Increments. 

Global ASNT Inc 1 fields required Extremely High Frequency/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (EHF/AEHF) capabilities and replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic mobile and fixed-site Single Channel Anti-jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical - Terminal (SMART-T) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global ASNT replaces inadequate, unsustainable strategic communications equipment at bomber, tanker and reconnaissance Wing Command Posts (WCPs), Nuclear Task Forces, Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS), and for Mobile Support Teams (MSTs).  Global ASNT is a ground-based system that will provide survivable, secure communication paths to receive Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), Force Management messages, and Force Direction messages and disseminate them to bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance aircrews. 

Global ASNT is being fielded in separate capability increments.  

Global ASNT Increment 2 delivers a replacement Aircrew Alerting System (AAS) consisting of personal and general alerting equipment, and High Frequency (HF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) capabilities.  Increment 2 replaces inadequate, unsustainable Electromagnetic Pulse Hardened Dispersal Communication (EHDC) systems and Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Information Systems Security Program - Includes resources, manpower authorizations, necessary facilities and equipment required to perform INFOSEC research and development, to provide INFOSEC services, to procure INFOSEC products required to secure telecommunications and information systems when such products are separately procurable from host systems, and to provide INFOSEC maintenance and support. Also includes costs associated with the protection afforded to telecommunications and information systems which process sensitive data and efforts to ensure authenticity, integrity, and availability of the information and the system.

The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) Element provides cradle-to-grave research, development, acquisitions, supply, sustainment, depot maintenance, and demilitarization of the Air Force (AF) cryptographic and key distribution /management systems (known as the Key Management Enterprise (KME)). ISSP delivers on rising national, DoD, and AF priorities to address cyber security threats and increasing war-fighter dependence on cyberspace. The AF and the DoD require the capability to secure, collect, process, store, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while denying an adversary the ability to intercept, collect, destroy, interpret, or manipulate our information flows. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full-spectrum operations. AF Communications Security (COMSEC) equipment protects information such as war-fighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the war-fighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. 

The overall focus of the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts within this program is to transform electronic key delivery and cryptographic devices to meet the next generation war-fighting requirements. These efforts are driven by the National Security Agency's (NSA) mandates to address decertifications, new requirements, and end of life issues. NSA's first tenet calls for an AF KME that permits a totally "man-out-of-the-loop" electronic crypto key distribution system from the generation of the key in the key processor all the way into the using End Crypto Unit (ECU). This eliminates the current key vulnerability of compromise /interruption by individuals transporting or loading the key. NSA's second tenet requires an inventory of cryptographic devices that are more robust, modular, scalable, capable, net-centric, and durable. This enables more effective and efficient performance including reduced inventory, expanded data rates, simplified upgrades, lower life cycle costs, and ensured global information grid-compatibility. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, as these budget activities include development efforts, including the AF KME, to upgrade systems currently fielded or have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Electronic Key Management System (AFEKMS) consists of multiple developments supporting the Air Force requirements portion of the DoD EKMS Program. The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD EKMS Program. AFEKMS, as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME) and in concert with the overarching DoD EKMS program, provides a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material, with users across DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) and all AF weapon systems. AFEKMS supports U.S. DoD Information Assurance. Information Assurance emphasizes confidentiality, access control, multi-level secure databases, trusted computing, and information integrity. DoD EKMS has a three-tier hierarchical structure. This tiered structure provides capability to distribute, manage, and account for COMSEC keying material.  Tier 2 installations comprise the local distribution network (COMSEC accounts) and Tier 3 is where keying material is transferred from the EKMS infrastructure to the consumers End Cryptographic Units (ECUs). Additionally, AFEKMS resources provide maintenance/distribution of AF Communications Security (COMSEC) publications for all AF users. 

EKMS improves protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy manual key management systems. EKMS has and continues to greatly accelerate availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission via Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) versus the manual handling and shipping of materials. While the current EKMS level-of-effort is directed at enhancing current and developing systems, the ultimate goal is for it to seamlessly transition to the net-centric DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The AFEKMS Program continues to provide software development to support emerging requirements during the KMI transition period. Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as development activities to extend life of the Simple Key Loader to bridge the gap between EKMS and the KMI implementation.

NOTE:  AF KME Software development (e.g., Data Management Device - DMD, Common User Application Software - CUAS, and Simple Key Loader - SKL) is rolled up into Tier 2/Tier 3 Development. Software upgrades can be bundled and tracked as a unit, thereby allowing less management overhead and more focus on configuration management and control.

The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>AF KME Post Production software development focuses on extending life of EKMS through transition to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) capabilities. This will be accomplished via the Intermediary Application (iApp) software and Tri-Service development of KOV-21 replacement chip through Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) by U.S. Army. The iApp is designed to include all major Data Management Device (DMD) capabilities. The iApp is designed to meet certification and accreditation requirements and iApp user interface is designed for ease of adoption and minimal user training for EKMS DMD, Consolidated Tier 3 Testing Infrastructure (CETTI) User Application Software (UAS), and Simple Key Loader (SKL). The CERDEC effort develops a replacement KOV-21 Card for current Simple Key Loader (SKL) to extend life of SKL until KMI compatible key loader is available.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort modernizes cryptographic devices protecting critical national security information across cyber domain operations. In September 2000, the Defense Review Board (DRB) tasked National Security Agency (NSA) to evaluate the security posture of the cryptographic inventory. Systems with aging algorithms, those approaching non-sustainability, and those generally incompatible with modern key management systems were also identified and have been replaced or are in the process of being replaced. Priority systems that required immediate replacement were also identified. In addition, NSA documented the need to modernize the cryptographic inventory with capabilities designed to enable network-centric operations. Replacements/Modernization of the near term vulnerable systems must occur within the timeframe specified by device and algorithm in Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Notice (CJCSN) 6510. The DoD Cryptographic Modernization Program was established to develop a modern cryptographic base that provides this assured security robustness, interoperability, advanced algorithms, releasability, programmability, and compatibility with the future Key Management Infrastructure (KMI-See PE 0303140F, Project 67523, AF KMI for a full description).  This AF effort supports an integrated effort across the cyber domain to transform to next-generation cryptographic capabilities.  It provides U.S. forces and multinational and interagency partners the security needed to protect the flow and exchange of operational decision making information in accordance with national and international policy/standards, the validated operational requirements of the warfighters, and the intelligence communities.  

The AF Cryptographic Modernization Effort is a collection of projects accomplished in three phases: replacement, modernization, and transformation. The replacement phase of the program focused on updating and/or replacing out-of-date algorithms along with unsustainable cryptographic products. The modernization phase provides crypto devices with common solutions that are more robust, modular, scalable, and provide the durability to existing cryptographic end items, as well as updating mid-term aging/unsupportable crypto equipment. Manpower and logistics requirements will be reduced and manpower efficiencies gained, while incremental capability enhancements and footprint reduction are provided. The third phase of the Cryptographic Modernization Program, transformation, provides common joint solutions which enable secure, transparent, network-centric capabilities across the cyber domain. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning/execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Implement AF portion of the DoD's Cryptographic Modernization (CM) Initiative through modernization/modification efforts, in varying stages of the acquisition cycle, with focus on minimizing life cycle costs. The CM portfolio of component acquisition projects is executing using a variety of approaches that vary from an evolutionary acquisition strategy using spiral development (for new component development) to incremental improvement leveraging leading-edge, certified non-developmental items (for modernization). Contract type is selected for each of the individual projects based upon its acquisition approach and its unique technology risks. A mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts have been selected which maximize the best value for the Government.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Key Management Enterprise (AF KME) Program consists of multiple developments supporting the AF requirements/portion of the DoD Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The National Security Agency (NSA) acts as the Executive Agent for the DoD KMI Program. AF KMI, in concert with this overarching DoD KMI Program, will provide a secure and flexible capability for the electronic generation, distribution, accounting, and management of key material and other communications security (COMSEC) materials for all DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and for the Services' weapon systems. KMI represents a broad-scale replacement of the current Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI will provide capabilities that will allow networked operation in consonance with the AF Information Network and other DoD, fellow Service, and AF enterprise objectives. It thereby will assure a viable support infrastructure for future weapons and C4I programs to incorporate key management into their system designs.

The DoD KMI will greatly improve protection of national security-related information by substantially enhancing confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation characteristics over the legacy EKMS. KMI will greatly accelerate the availability of crypto key materials through electronic transmission versus shipping of materials, will enhance mission responsiveness and flexibility, and will eventually take the man "out-of-the-loop" in the distribution of crypto key materials.

The AF KMI Program in concert with the DoD KMI Program is transitioning the Air Force from the legacy EKMS to modern DoD KMI and building the AF KMI Last Mile architecture. This Research and Development effort includes system engineering, development and testing to successfully implement the AF KMI Last Mile architecture as part of the AF Key Management Enterprise (KME). The AF KMI Last Mile is a holistic solution integrating the legacy and new and evolving cryptographic programs, materials, products, sources and consumers. The AF KMI Last Mile capabilities include as part of the AF KME distribution, management, and loading of cryptographic materials from the KMI (COMSEC account) to the end cryptographic unit (ECU). It builds the linkage interfaces that will allow KMI systems to communicate and integrate other related developments to meet operational needs. AF KMI Last Mile is currently in the Development Phase. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

In parallel with AF KMI, DoD and the Services are addressing the need for a new generation of future KMI-aware ECUs that will be capable of direct interaction with the DoD KMI Enterprise, under the Joint Crypto Modernization Initiative  (PE0303140F, BPAC 675100, Cryptographic Modernization, supports this initiative).  In some cases these new ECUs, although needing to be supported by KMI, will not be KMI network-connected. "Last mile" transport of black (aka benign, or encrypted) and red (unencrypted) keying material from a KMI client to a new generation ECU or current legacy ECU will need to be handled in the early years by one of two data transfer devices.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISSP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Protection Risk Management (EPRM) is an automated risk management framework to assess and mitigate cyber and other threats to Air Force information technology and mission assets. This capability eliminates stove pipes and provides commanders with better situational awareness of vulnerabilities. Additionally, this capability promotes efficiency and sound resource allocation by enabling commanders to make better decisions when selecting risk reduction counter measures.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI) is a Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiative to standardize force structure data, making it visible, accessible, and understandable across the Department of Defense (DoD). This initiative is accomplished through each service's Organizational Server. The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) consumes data from various Air Force Authoritative Data Sources (ADSs), validates it, formats it in a consistent force structure data standard, and publishes it for consumption by programs of record that use force structure data. The AFOS is the ADS for Air Force Authorized Force Structure and provides critical unit, billet, crew platform, vehicle, and command relationship data within the Air Force to the Joint Staff (J8) for war and contingency planning, by providing visibility of the entire force structure as a function of time: past, present and future.

The AFOS produces consistent force structure data in the Global Force Management Information Exchange Model format that is well defined, centrally managed, and inter-operable as a standardized representation of the organization's hierarchy in all other programs of record that use force structure data. The end goal of the GFM-DI AFOS is to integrate the four force management processes (Assignment, Manpower &amp; Personnel, Readiness, and Allocation), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the GFM-DI system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The anticipated contract structure will be Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The Air Force Organizational Server (AFOS) PMO will utilize a mix of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Interface Requirement Agreements with AFOS stakeholders and support agencies as part of its management strategy. SLAs will be developed with the Lead Developmental Test Organization and the Capabilities Integration Environment at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex. The AFOS PMO also maintains Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with several AFOS input and output systems, including Manpower Programming &amp; Execution Systems,  Air Force Directory Services, Air Force Equipment Management System, and Force Structure Data Management.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program provides signals intelligence (SIGINT) development efforts for all USAF airborne platforms. The funds in this Program are distributed among all Airborne SIGINT Enterprise (ASE) projects based on the development priorities established by the USAF SIGINT Capabilities Working Group (SCWG) in order to build a total SIGINT capability. As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent and emerging warfighter needs. This program will participate in the development, integration, testing, and implementation of international and Air Force standards (to include North Atlantic Treaty Organization standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Modernization efforts include sensors for the platforms and where appropriate, their interfaces with the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS). This approach supports a synergistic development effort providing a true Air Force-wide capability.

This enterprise will use the Air Force SIGINT Architecture (AFSA) for planning and decision-making and, in turn, employ open architecture standards whenever possible to allow maximum ease of future upgrades and system interoperability. The primary goal of the ASE is to produce an architecture-based, capability-focused SIGINT investment strategy for the USAF. Funds in any project may be used to fund initiatives in other projects within this Program at the discretion of the SCWG.
Funds in any project can also cover activities to include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

The FY 19 funding request for Project 675185, Non-Traditional SIGINT, was reduced by $18.063 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, and other efforts associated with the integration and modification of the RC-135 SIGINT sensors and their associated air and ground components. Through extensive utilization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) based solutions to field needed capabilities, it also incurs a need for continuous identification of suitable replacements for components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and integration efforts consistent with the COTS technology cycle.  These efforts provide required engineering for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations integrated into the various baseline modifications.  These funds will be split between the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT, the RC-135U COMBAT SENT, and the RC-135S COBRA BALL programs.  Funding reflects the SCWG priorities and the accomplishment of other Airborne SIGINT Enterprise initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports design studies, engineering analysis, non-recurring engineering, program management administration and other efforts associated with the insertion of new capabilities integrated into Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) and other sensors and their associated air and ground components that will be used on/by more than one platform.  The common development SIGINT project also supports development of new sensors capabilities, normalization of quick reaction capabilities, and develops replacement components affected by Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS).  New capabilities are developed by separate projects. This project also supports the development of projects common to the Airborne SIGINT Enterprise Program overall to include, but not limited to: the Air Force SIGINT Architecture maintenance, modeling and simulation efforts, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization SIGINT efforts.

Development supports ASIP system upgrades and potential follow-on sensors. The ASIP sensor is designed to be a common SIGINT system, allowing for maximum coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum through the use of an integrated high and low band system. Follow-on objectives include but are not limited to use of open architecture concepts and rapid integration of new signals of interests.

Capability improvements will be inserted into the ASIP sensor through individual development efforts to exploit signals of interest identified as service priorities by the Air Force SCWG.  This project provides the warfighter near term increased combat capability. Enhancements are implemented as soon as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels.  Compatibility improvements will be inserted into the ASIP through individual development efforts to exploit signals of interest identified as Service priorities by the USAF SCWG. Sensors will be integrated and tested on the various platforms as funding permits.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SIGINT sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COMPASS BRIGHT develops, demonstrates, and rapidly transitions advanced Air Force specific SIGINT capabilities against emerging and future target signals of interest.  This program pursues SIGINT technologies for program transition, to include Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Audio, Analytics, Special Signals of Interest, and Radio Frequency Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT).  The COMPASS BRIGHT program objective is to develop technologies for application in SIGINT and MASINT systems or subsystems. Acquisition and production of these developed technologies will occur within the appropriate platform programs. COMPASS BRIGHT projects are selected through a data call process, whereby the USAF evaluates proposals from the laboratories and industry partners, to select those projects that are most promising.

Operational Reconnaissance (Ops Recce) is part of the Electronic Warfare Data (EW Data) initiative to improve overall USAF intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability through development and use of sensor data from non-ISR platforms and innovative use of sensors.  This program pursues Ops Recce capabilities for transition through development, testing, demonstration and implementation efforts across all platforms.  The Ops Recce program objective is to provide increased battlespace awareness through the use of sensors/platforms to achieve effects beyond what those sensor/platforms were originally designed.   

The program office authority extends to accomplishment of out-of-cycle, nontraditional SIGINT (NTISR) efforts.  These tasks may be filtered through the SIGINT Capability Working Group outside the normal vetting process to expedite acquisition of high-end capabilities for the warfighter.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>On an annual basis, the SCWG reviews developmental technologies against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps. Projects advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement for the coming fiscal year. As a result, the USAF will move funds between projects periodically to develop the highest priority projects in response to urgent and emerging warfighter needs.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Office of Commercial Economic Analysis (OCEA) will produce in-depth analytical assessments and advanced risk mitigation strategies based on commercially available industry, market, and economic information.  These assessments and strategies will support the decision making efforts of Service, Department of Defense, and Whole of Government to protect Defense Industrial Base (DIB) equities and sustain the U.S. competitive advantage.  

The funding request provides for an enterprise Information Technology (IT) platform providing a technical prototype which will aggregate risk data and produce mitigation strategies and impact analysis products.  The funding also supports continuous assessment of the commercially available information to ensure it is accurate, current, and relevant.

Additional classified details can be found in OSD Comptroller's classified Justification Book Volume 6.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 675218, Applications Development and Project Number 675220, Unit Level, were transferred to PE 0305015F, C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS), Project Number 675218, Applications Development and Project Number 675220, Unit Level, in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>C2AOS-C2IS funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's (AF) C2 capabilities and services. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013). These activities include C2AOS-C2IS needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).

Applications Development: Command and Control (C2) Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS)creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest. C2AOS-C2IS also develops and matures modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

Unit Level: Unit Command and Control (UC2) funds are used to develop and integrate UC2 as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC. UC2 operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD) by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning. UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development and Unit Level capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2019, 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 675220, Unit Level, was transferred to PE 0305015F, C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS), Project Number 675220, Unit Level, in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project funds are used to develop and integrate Unit Command and Control (UC2) as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC. UC2 operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD) by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning. UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

In FY 2019, Unit Level core development activities will be to add functions that improve user experience. Additional FY 2019 activities will include resolving deficiencies discovered during developmental tests (DT), maintaining information assurance (IA) posture, and ensuring integration and testing of UC2 interfaces with other applications.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unit Level capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305020F, project 674901, Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCMD Intel IT), is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community
users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to
support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the CCIIT Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to
advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline Enterprise Architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305020F, project 674901, Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCMD Intel IT), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community
users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the CCIIT Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline Enterprise Architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Combatant Commands (CCMDs) require a cohesive, flexible Information Technology enterprise to ensure intelligence content informs analysis, planning, warfighter operations, and strategic decision making. Currently, the Combatant Command Intelligence Information Technology (CCIIT) Enterprise is at the nexus of multiple service providers, networks, systems, applications, classification levels, and funding. The vast majority of these IT services are tailored to Intelligence Community
users vice CCMD-specific missions or needs. This minority stake and the physical and organizational separation of CCMD users limits their ability to influence the development and delivery of services, or results in poorly sustained one-off, vice enduring enterprise-wide, solutions. Beginning in late 2014, the CCMDs requested the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSD(I)) and the Joint Staff address longstanding gaps in their intelligence IT capabilities to support planning and operations. In response, OUSD(I) and Joint Staff/J2 sponsored an effort to document the required capabilities and chronic shortfalls, and to validate these requirements through the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The initial Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) for the CCIIT Enterprise was completed in February 2016, and an Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) was approved by the JROC in September 2016. In November 2016, USD(I) requested the Secretary of the Air Force, Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA) establish a Provisional Program Activity Office (PPAO) for CCIIT, to advocate for materiel and non-materiel solutions for these validated requirements. Through FY2017, the CCIIT PPAO has actively engaged with the CCMDs and service providers throughout DoD and the IC to refine requirements, identify potential solutions, produce an integrated baseline Enterprise Architecture, and align and integrate capabilities across the enterprise critical to the warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element funds the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Aerospace Management Systems Division (AMSD), the designated Air Force (AF) Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Navigation Safety Center of Excellence (COE).  The COE provides expertise to Headquarters Air Force, AF major commands (MAJCOM), and weapon system program offices regarding CNS/ATM system technical functions and performance standards for operation in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and international civil airspace.  This centralized capability supplements the MAJCOMs and over 50 AF weapon system program offices with resident CNS/ATM technical expertise.

This funding enables the AMSD to monitor and participate in government and industry technical forums responsible for the development and assessment of international civil aviation standards for operations in worldwide airspace.  Division personnel analyze civil standards as they are being developed and work to influence them to support Department of Defense (DoD) interests.  CNS/ATM experts identify specific technical and engineering criteria and document them in generic performance matrices (GPMs).  The COE works with MAJCOM and program office personnel to develop strategies for implementing CNS/ATM requirements on AF weapon systems.  Specifically, CNS/ATM experts work with program office systems engineers to tailor the GPMs to apply civil standards to each platform's unique avionics architecture.  Once CNS/ATM component integration and testing is completed, COE personnel validate platform CNS/ATM performance against the standards necessary to operate in civil airspace.  

The program office manages an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that enables a centralized procurement of CNS/ATM and navigation safety avionics equipment. These contracts are used by aircraft program offices across the DoD, among other federal agencies, and in support of foreign military sales.

This program performs periodic audits required by civil aviation assurance standards on processes used to develop and distribute the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) to DoD users. This electronic navigation database, developed and maintained by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), contains critical safety of flight information used by DoD flight crews to fly instrument flight rules procedures worldwide.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CNS/ATM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605833F and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This budget activity funds operational development necessary to acquire, sustain, and enhance segments of Air Force Weather Services (AFWS).  Activities also include research and analysis to support current program planning. Management Service costs include Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and Advisory and Assistance Service (A&amp;AS). AFWS provides timely, accurate, consistent and relevant space and atmospheric (a.k.a. terrestrial) weather information for global battlespace situational awareness. AFWS supports worldwide operations of Air Force and Army warfighters, Special Operation Forces, and other government agencies with weather observing and forecasting capabilities at in-garrison and deployed locations, as well as centralized, reach-back capabilities.  Additionally, these funds integrate DoD, government agency, and commercial and international partners environmental data with AFWS information system equipment for processing, storing, exploiting and disseminating weather information for analysis, forecasting, and mission integration at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Weather system technological upgrades provide critical support to modern air and space combat operations. These systems enhance the lethality, effectiveness, and survivability of AF weapon systems and precision munitions by accurately predicting environmental impacts to optimize mission execution and planning, targeting, weaponeering, and battle damage assessment, as well as both AF and government agency space systems operations and effectiveness.

AFWS aligns activities under four capability areas:  Weather Data Collection, Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination, Weather Forecasting, and Product Tailoring/Warfighter Applications.  This alignment ensures an integrated and systems-oriented approach to program management decisions. Of these four capability areas, two (Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination and Weather Forecasting) are addressed by APPN 3600, BA 07, PE 0305111F, Project 672738 - Weather Service. 
 
1. Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination provides centralized Weather Web Service capability, increased availability of weather impacts and products, improved global, regional, and theater-level forecasts, specific mission-tailored weather data on demand, and finally increased weapon system interoperability which shortens the Combatant Commander kill chain through machine to machine interfaces.  This is accomplished through large-scale data processing, product generation, a presentation system utilizing Open Geo-spatial Consortium (OGC) services architecture and providing the capability to ingest, process, store, access, and disseminate meteorological oceanographic (METOC) data. The Weather Data Analysis and Dissemination capability area includes activities for Weather Data Analysis and its follow-on increment, Weather Data Analysis Increment 5 (WDA and WDA-Inc 5). 
 
2. Weather Forecasting provides advanced scientific numerical weather prediction capabilities for automated, high resolution forecast products for mission execution, rehearsal, and planning. Weather Forecasting includes activities for Numerical Weather Modeling (NWM); Weather Services - Live, Virtual, Constructive (WS-LVC), and Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS).  SWAFS is a suite of programs consisting of Global Assimilation of Ionosphere Measurement-Full Physics (GAIM-FP), and (in FY2019) Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System-Radiation Exposure (SWAFS-RadEx). SWAFS provides decision makers with 1) Satellite operations, 2) Predictions of HF &amp; UHF/SHF (SATCOM) communications outages, 3) GPS inaccuracies in navigation &amp; targeting, 4) Tracking objects like satellites, debris, projectiles in space and forecasts for radar outages and early warning radar false launch indications, 5) National, strategic, operational &amp; tactical intelligence collection, 6) Radiation forecasts for high altitude/space flight operations. 

The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AF Weather utilizes spiral and incremental development efforts using multiple contracts supporting a family of ACAT III Programs of Record through development, fielding, and sustainment.

Cost Plus contracts are utilized for software development and sustainment and Fixed Firm Price contracts for COTS systems and Contract Logistics Support (CLS) efforts. Pre-competed GSA and Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) contract vehicles are leveraged when appropriate, and competitive and small-business awards are favored.

The Air Force Program Executive Officer for Battle Management (AFPEO BM) and the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space (AFPEO SP) are the PEOs for the AFWS. AFPEO BM manages the ground-based atmospheric sensing and data analysis, atmospheric forecast systems, and product tailoring warfighter applications. AFPEO SP manages the ground-based segments of space weather collection platforms as well as the Space Weather Analysis and Forecasting System. Both the AFPEO BM and AFPEO SP are their respective program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support the Air Force worldwide flying mission, this program element funds research, development, and management of new air traffic control communications, surveillance, positioning, and precision approach and landing systems. When applicable, this includes joint efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and coordination with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ATCALS development funding currently focuses on the Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transportation System (ATS), Air Traffic Control Future Technology (ATC), and Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON) programs as described below.  

NextGen ATS.  This is the United States initiative for the transformation of the National Airspace System (NAS) over the next 20-30 years to enhance safety, security, efficiency, affordability and capacity, meeting the requirements of all users of the NAS. This interagency effort is designed to enable the transition from a ground infrastructure dominated Air Traffic Management capability to a capability that leverages advances in aircraft Performance Based Navigation (PBN), non-radar based surveillance services, and transition from solid-state analog voice communications to networked digital voice and data exchange. Per Deputy Secretary of Defense Direction (28 Dec 07 Memo), the Air Force is the Department of Defense (DoD) lead Service for NextGen ATS implementation and architecture development. NextGen ATS will be built on key elements from existing programs and technologies and on new systems under development. As these technologies and architectures mature, ground system upgrades will be coordinated and fielded concurrently with aircraft avionics capabilities that are acquired and integrated into Air Force aircraft (manned and unmanned). These efforts will involve aircraft avionics as well as fixed based and deployable air traffic control and landing systems. FY19 efforts will continue to use the Lead Service Office (LSO) process to continue enabling Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) access to the National Airspace (NAS), develop a NextGen ATS DoD Strategic Roadmap, Consolidated Avionics Repository, add new capabilities to Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) software, and outline DoD and Air Force equities and requirements via in-depth analysis of FAA NextGen ATS programs and timelines.  Portfolio analysis will be captured in DoD NextGen ATS charters to guide Services through a broad and complex NextGen ATS environment. To minimize integration costs, the LSO will work with other organizations such as the Aerospace Management Systems Division, across the Air Force and the DoD, to adopt a common framework with practical guidelines to evaluate the validity of NextGen ATS initiatives with the Air Force's mission. These efforts support the development of operational strategies that realize the achievement of valid NextGen ATS initiatives in concert with acquisition strategies in integrated avionics advances for systems such as Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Global Positioning System (GPS) Military (M)-Code, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Data Communications (Data Comm), and PBN. In support of (UAS) operations, FY19 program office efforts will also continue to support requests for implementation of Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) at new locations which will allow UAS integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) without the use of ground observers or chase aircraft.  In FY19, the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) will continue NextGen ATS strategic planning efforts, conduct lead service operational test and evaluation as required, and also examine new civil air traffic control and landing system technologies that may have military utility to include an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Tower System technology. In total, these efforts will focus on enabling DoD aircraft to take advantage of NextGen ATS envisioned efficiencies, developing policies/procedures to reduce costs while ensuring airspace access, seamlessly integrating UASs into the NAS and international airspaces, improving the display of aircraft position to air traffic controllers, determining future requirements for digital communications with manned and unmanned aircraft, and enhancing flight safety. 
  
Deployable Radar Approach Control (D-RAPCON).  D-RAPCON will replace the 40 year old Air National Guard (ANG) AN/MPN-14K and Active Duty (AD) AN/TPN-19 Airport Surveillance Radar and Operations Shelter subsystems with state-of-the-art digital systems.  Due to diminishing manufacturing sources, modification and overhaul of the existing systems has proven to be ineffective.  On average, due to systemic equipment failures, no more than four of the existing 14 systems are deployable at any given time and none are fully mission capable.  The current AN/TPN-19 (4 systems) and AN/MPN-14K (10 systems) operational availability rates are 25% and 60% respectively versus a requirement of D-RAPCON of 98%.  D-RAPCON will provide aircraft surveillance/sequencing, air traffic control communications, automation capabilities for terminal area air traffic control operations, and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and secure communication capabilities (a deferred key system attribute).  D-RAPCON will also be deployed with a fixed base or deployable Instrument Landing System, a fixed or mobile control tower, and a fixed or mobile Tactical Air Navigation system to provide a complete air traffic control capability.  D-RAPCON will support the full range of tactical military, worldwide humanitarian, and domestic disaster relief operations.  The primary surveillance radar coverage (non-cooperative targets) extends out 60 nautical miles (nm) and the secondary surveillance radar coverage (cooperative targets) will increase from 120 nm to 200 nm.  The D-RAPCON Capability Development Document was approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council on 8 Feb 11.  Related OPAF funds are in PE 0305114F Weapon System Code 833010.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the ATCALS weapon system capability.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ATCALS is a basket program element with multiple programs in various stages of acquisition which provide the air traffic control infrastructure to support peacetime and wartime missions.  The current acquisition strategy is focused on replacing 1960/70s era deployable and fixed based equipment with mature off-the-shelf technology with remote maintenance capability while also looking to the future under the NextGen ATS initiative.

Current contracting efforts include D-RAPCON development, GBSAA/NextGen ATS planning and implementation, and conduct of an Early Operational Assessment (EOA) of Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower technology.  The contracting strategy for D-RAPCON development is based on award of a competitive fixed price incentive firm contract emphasizing off-the-shelf technology and maximizing the use of non-developmental items. The contract includes engineering, manufacturing, and development and test with follow-on production options.  GBSAA and NextGen ATS Enterprise Architecture Implementation Tasks are being executed via Military Inter-Departmental Purchase Requests, and Project Orders with various organizations (FAA, MITRE, Army, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Air Force Flight Standards Agency).  The Remote Virtual ATC Control Tower EOA contract will be a full and open competition using Other Transaction Authority.        

The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (BM) is the PEO for ATCALS.  PEO/BM is also the delegated milestone decision authority for ATCALS.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Aerospace Management Systems Division (AFLCMC/HBA) is aligned under the PEO/BM and includes program management, contracts, logistics, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>D-RAPCON total cost and target value of contract differ as target value of contract includes prior years costs and the total cost only includes FY16-FY18.  Total cost with prior years does not differ from the contract target value.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT:  D-RAPCON is evaluated against traditional Research and Development (R&amp;D) program expenditure benchmarks.  Unlike traditional R&amp;D programs, however, the D-RAPCON "Acquisition Phase" contract is a FPIF contract with progress payments.  20 percent of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated.  Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health.</r2:Remarks>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production. Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 full scale aerial target, BQM-167A subscale aerial target, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve aerial targets capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver "Aerial Targets BA 07: Operational Systems Development" weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

BA 07: This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale aerial targets, subscale aerial targets, and companion Target Control Systems (TCS) assure the effectiveness and currency of warfighter weapon systems to combat real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  The BQM-167A Air Force Subscale Aerial Target (AFSAT) is a reusable jet-powered target aircraft measuring approximately 20 feet long with a mission to simulate threat aircraft for testing and evaluation of surface-to-air, ship-to-air, or air-to-air missiles.  The target accomplishes this mission through the use of optional payloads including chaff and flare, electronic attack, and infrared devices.  Funding supports continued improvement of launch phase performance and overall performance enhancement efforts.  Funding supports development, improvements, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements to include but not limited to missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. 

Electronic Attack (EA) payload upgrade provides new techniques and capabilities critical to subscales and full-scales to realistically emulate foreign threat systems in support of weapons testing.  

TCS provides a myriad of sub-systems that together delivers the capability to control and track mission aerial targets (full-scale and subscale) and to track a mix of other critical mission participants (to include relay platforms, shooters, and the missile system under test).  In this role, TCS ensures an optimum integrated aerial target environment that enhances both weapon system assessments and companion aircrew skills, all the while assuring the full safety of mission participants throughout the conduct and fulfillment of T&amp;E objectives.  Funding supports continued improvement (modernization) of TCS capabilities to effectively meet the multi-service T&amp;E demands of current and future warfighter weapon systems.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This BPAC is an administrative continuation of BPAC 675366: QF-16, and encompasses the same efforts with the addition of threat realism enhancements to support future Title 10 LT&amp;E requirements.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production. Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, F-15, and other aircraft. Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 full scale aerial target, BQM-167A subscale aerial target, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve aerial targets capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver "Aerial Targets BA 07: Operational Systems Development" weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Full-scale Aerial Targets assure warfighters weapon systems perform effectively against real-world enemy fighters and cruise missiles.  Aerial Targets support adherence to Public Law Title 10, Section 2366, which requires major systems and munitions programs to conduct live fire survivability and lethality testing before full-rate production.  Targets are used to validate operational missile/weapon system effectiveness and fighter operational flight program (OFP) updates.  Targets are required for developmental/operational testing for all air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, and for the F-22A, F-35, F-18, F-16, and F-15, aircraft.   The United States Air Force's (USAF) Air Superiority Modernization/Mission Area Plan has identified aerial targets as a capability shortfall; the QF-16 program fulfills this requirement.  Funding supports simulator development and improvements on the QF-16 full scale aerial target, and updates of target control systems and specialized target payload subsystems for requirements such as: missile scoring, electronic attack and infrared (IR) countermeasures, radar and IR signature augmentation, and chaff and flare dispensing systems. Development is required to evolve QF-16 threat capabilities to meet current and future threats identified by OSD.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver "Aerial Targets 675366: QF-16" weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) conducts specialized investigative activities and force protection support for Air Force (AF) commanders worldwide. This assists AF commanders in protecting their people and resources. AFOSI's mission includes investigating criminal matters affecting AF personnel, contract fraud and economic crimes involving AF weapons systems and spare parts, the investigation of environmental crime, counterdrugs, computer intrusion detection and forensic media analysis of computer crimes. This element supports Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM), Computer Crime Investigations (CCI), and technical support to criminal and counterintelligence investigations and operations conducted by AFOSI. AFOSI's TSCM mission conducts counterintelligence investigations
for both AF and DoD facilities and programs in order to deter and detect technical surveillance operations conducted by Foreign Intelligence Services to compromise classified or sensitive information. The purpose of CCI research is to improve AF and DoD Information Operations capability by enhancing AFOSI's ability to deter or prevent spies, hackers, or saboteurs from manipulating, damaging, or stealing sensitive war fighting data or systems. Failing that, to investigate, identify, and prosecute
those who do. While most research to meet operational requirements is Operational System Development, there is also research in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing Development due to a need for modifications to present technology. The equipment required to provide technical support to investigations is unique and complex. This equipment must be continually updated to provide state-of-the-art capabilities to detect and neutralize criminal activities targeted against the AF and DoD.
In an era of advancing technology, reduced manning, and increasingly high level fraud, environmental crime and computer crime investigations, technical investigative equipment must be continuously updated to enable AFOSI special agents to have the most cost effective and best possible means of thwarting criminal acts. The evolution of a new wave of computer crimes has made AFOSI responsible for the collection, investigative analysis, national level law enforcement coordination, and dissemination of hacker activity and intrusion incidents for the Air Force. AFOSI's computer crime equipment must stay on the leading edge of technology to collect criminal information as well as pursue and apprehend criminals through a global medium. AFOSI must continually update its existing high tech computer surveillance equipment to support ongoing and future investigative operations to identify hackers and hacker groups, as well as potential hostile government activities targeting Air Force communication and control systems. Critical Infrastructure Protection identifies weaknesses in the Air Force Critical infrastructure, highlights critical
countermeasures and acquires and deploys cost-effective solutions. The intent is to provide an Air Force-wide review of current infrastructure vulnerabilities; prioritize AF protection planning and integrate with existing programs; identify gaps based on AF needs; direct studies to refine AF requirements.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Market Research is accomplished jointly within the DoD, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement communities with the various government laboratories and major  contractors to identify locations with the ability to develop investigative tools unique to our mission needs. These technologies, capabilities, and limitations of current and future investigative tools is sometimes highly sensitive or classified. Market Research also allows inter-agency coordination and deconfliction to occur,
reducing or eliminating duplicitous development efforts. Annually, stakeholders meet to discuss initiatives, challenges and organizational goals to coordinate or consolidate requirements to increase efficiency. Once Market Research and any applicable coordination/deconfliction is completed, acquisition channels are analyzed and selected based on the ability to meet operational and technical security requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The OC-135B aircraft supports the implementation of the United States Government (USG) Open Skies Treaty. This program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15).  The Open Skies Treaty allows signatories to conduct observation flights over each other's territory using fixed-wing, unarmed observation aircraft. The aircraft can use optical cameras, video cameras, sideways-looking synthetic aperture radar, and infrared line scanning devices.  There are 34 participating states to the Open Skies Treaty.  The Air Force is required to allow over flight of USAF bases per multilateral request; to acquire, operate, and maintain the aircraft and equipment utilized during over flights of partner countries; to provide required sensor media and initial media processing; and to provide airfield servicing, logistics, and maintenance for foreign over flights of the US.

Open Skies Sensors - Mission equipment on the OC-135B includes wet film optical framing and panoramic cameras.  Open Skies Sensors program addresses the requirements in the Presidential Policy Directive-15 (PPD-15), which states," The United States shall begin budgeting no later than FY14 to upgrade the sensors on the current aircraft by replacing film-based cameras with available electro-optical sensors. (U)" 

Test articles will be procured for the purpose of developmental testing and to support Treaty certification of the sensors.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver DVIS.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,0605832F, and 0605898F</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established the Senior Year Program in 1955. The program has evolved significantly over the years to include the U-2 airframe, engines, sensors, cameras, recorders, data links, life support systems, test facilities and equipment. The U-2S model airframes were constructed in the late 1980s, with the last aircraft rolling off the assembly line in 1989. The U-2S provides global reconnaissance signals intelligence (SIGINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) 24 hours a day, seven days a week in support of national and DoD worldwide missions. The U-2 is currently deployed to forward operating locations (FOL) around the world. Modifications to the aircraft and payloads are required to ensure continued operational effectiveness in support of Combatant Commander Requirements and in accordance with previous NDAA guidance.

In the 2013 PB, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2 weapon system instead of retiring it. At that time sustainment efforts and capability upgrades to the platform and payloads were pursued to support National and Combatant Commander requirements.

In the 2015 PB, the Air Force decided to retire the U-2 in 2016. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the U-2 weapon system is identified as Equipment Scheduled For Retirement Or Disposal: Limitation On Expenditures For Modifications, stating that modification to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number, weapon, or item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within 5 years after the date on which the modification would be completed) are prohibited.

In the 2016 PB, the Air Force re-phases U-2 divestiture to begin in FY2019 and to complete no later than FY2020. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2244a, the Secretary of the Air Force may waive the prohibition on modifications if the Secretary determines that carrying out the modification is in the national security interest of the United States. Therefore, modifications required to address sustainment issues (diminishing manufacturing sources, vanishing vendor items) or operational utility may be submitted to the Secretary for approval to ensure operational effectiveness and to comply with guidance received in previous and current NDAAs for the timeframe of phased divestiture. The National Security Waiver was signed by the Secretary of the Air Force on 26 May 2015.

In the 2017 PB, the Air Force continued addressing reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of payloads and capabilities by taking prudent acquisition actions to meet operational requirements, comply with previous NDAA guidance, and IAW 10 U.S.C. Prudent acquisition activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development  in support of both current program planning and execution as well as studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. 

In the 2018 and 2019 PB, the Air Force decided to retain the U-2, funding investment and manpower in base, and the majority of operations and sustainment in OCO. The Air Force will continue to address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues and support U-2 integration of payloads and capabilities by taking prudent acquisition actions to meet operational and safety of flight requirements. These acquisition efforts will include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution as well as studies supporting analysis and investment in future U-2 program planning. 

The U-2 Program provides funding for an Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) acquisition effort. This effort will design, fabricate, integrate, and demonstrate system capability enhancements for a high altitude deep look SAR system. This mitigates a Diminishing Manufacturing Supply and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issue with the current U-2 SAR sensor.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Medium Altitude Global ISR and Communications (MAGIC) project was an Air Force led technology and concept development to demonstrate the ability for a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to stay airborne in the medium altitude structure for a multiple day duration mission with a minimum of 1,000 pounds payload capacity of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.  The MAGIC concept was initiated by OSD/DDR&amp;E in FY 2010 in response to the Combatant Commanders ranking this type of initiative as the highest priority for a Joint Concept and Technology Demonstration (JCTD).   In FY 2011, the Air Force accepted this initiative as the sponsor and MAGIC was subsequently removed from consideration as a JCTD and transitioned into the Air Force as a developmental project.  

The MAGIC project was intended to provide the USAF with data regarding sensor and aircraft performance parameters at a multiple day duration at medium altitude flight.  The objectives laid out in the JCTD competition and selection of Aurora Flight Sciences (AFS)'s Orion RPA for the long endurance demonstration was managed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG).

In FY 2010, OSD/DDR&amp;E (now ASD/R&amp;E) provided $5M of initial funding to AFRL to initiate the MAGIC project.  In FY 2011, ASD/R&amp;E provided an additional $5M to keep the MAGIC project development moving forward.  The Air Force provided $10M of FY 2011.  Congressional Adds of $19M in FY 2012, $50M in FY 2013, $20M in FY 2015, $5M in FY 2016, and $50M in FY 2017 provided the Endurance UAV program manager with the funding for the continuation of the Orion RPA development and initiation of the three phase flight testing series.     

Orion RPA flight test series and demonstrations were accomplished at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, CA between August 2013 and March 2015.  The objectives to test/demonstrate basic air vehicle performance, expansion of the flight characteristic envelope, a multiple day sortie and integration of a nominal sensor payload were successfully accomplished on the prototype (Block 0) Orion RPA in a controlled environment non-representative of an operational setting.  Subsequent development efforts concentrated on the validation of the Orion RPA system requirements and concept design/specifications for a follow-on air vehicle (Block 1) capable of operational deployment in the event that the Air Force chooses the Orion RPA as a quick reaction capable system for a theater of operation or a program of record.  Currently, there is no validated requirement for the Orion RPA.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current of subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>There is currently no validated requirement for the Orion RPA. The concept for the Air Force to develop a long endurance, persistent ISR capability for the Combatant Commanders was an outgrowth of a JCTD started in FY 2010. Previous development efforts included: completion of studies analysis, development of a prototype air vehicle (Block 0), bench testing of engines and other aircraft components, ground continuity testing of select avionics, flight controls, and engine components, slow and high speed ground taxiing and a full flight series testing of the Orion RPA capabilities to include a multiple day, long duration flight demonstration. Starting with a portion of the FY 2015 funds, congressional adds have continued hardware and software engineering and development efforts towards operational airworthiness standards and mission requirements for a deployable air vehicle (Block 1).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305206F, project 674820, Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) 2B, is a new start.

In FY 2019, Program 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort was transferred to Program 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems (ARS), Project 674818 Imaging and Targeting Support, in order to align funding with like ATR development efforts. 
In FY 2019 funding transferred from Program 0604257F Advanced Technology And Sensors (Project 646025 Data Compression and Project 644818 Imaging and Targeting Support) to Program 0305206F Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, to continue maturing existing projects (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS), Reduction of Data Using Compression Enhancement (RDUCE), Detection Removal and Characterization Operation (DRACO), Sensor Open System Architecture (SOSA) and Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) within that program.
In FY 2019 funding was added to Project 676031 to support Dismount Radar efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of Airborne Reconnaissance System (ARS)Program is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities). It provides for modeling/ simulation, training and systems engineering. This program also coordinates the development of common collection, processing, and dissemination solutions for near real time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). A portion of the funding in Project 674818 will be distributed in priority order, as supported by Airborne Sensors for ISR (ASI) efforts and set by the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities  Working Group (GCWG), for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities within the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI efforts. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include, but are not limited to, development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.
Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. Additionally, funding covers GCWG Secretariat to manage GCWG planning, processes, and establish an Air Force GEOINT architecture.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2019, Program 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort was transferred to Program 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems (ARS), Project 674818 Imaging and Targeting Support, in order to align funding with like ATR development efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of the Imaging and Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) / Agile ISR is to develop, mature, demonstrate, and rapidly transition next-generation, persistent, wide area surveillance and common imagery reconnaissance sensor capabilities (active and passive systems), including sensor data processing, for multiple airborne platforms, as well as sensor products to aid in rapid targeting (geolocation models, sensor-based exploitation tools, sensor networking capabilities).

Developmental efforts pursued include: improved sensor capabilities such as hyperspectral imagery (HSI), measurement and signature intelligence, polarimetric imaging, ground moving target indication (GMTI), maritime search/track, Inverse SAR, foliage penetration and additional radar, electro-optical, nuclear event detection, and other modalities; increased geolocation accuracy; increased dismount detection capability; advanced sensor data correlation; automated target detection; network centric warfare; and other ISR and associated planning and direction; collection; processing and exploitation; analysis and production; and dissemination capabilities. These efforts are intended to reduce both target search and kill chain timelines as well as supporting traditional intelligence activities. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces.

The funds in this project are distributed in priority order, as supported by the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document and set by the GCWG, for the goal of building a comprehensive GEOINT capability for the USAF. On an annual basis, developmental technologies are reviewed against warfighter capabilities and requirements based on strategic roadmaps and the results of the ASI AoA as prefaced in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Efforts advancing the technological maturity of promising sensors and processing capabilities are reviewed and prioritized into a recommended list for senior executive direction to implement in the coming year. ASARS 2B efforts include but are not limited to development, design, fabrication, integration, demonstration, test, and transition of high altitude, deep look ISR radar.

Inclusive in I&amp;TS is the Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort to further mature a robust capability to detect all classes of targets through camouflage. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Sensors will have to penetrate up to highly contested domains and survive to operate. This project will also increase interoperability by developing common standards and interfaces for mission and sensor systems. Through the AoA execution, the solution set will improve requirements and the development path for High Altitude SAR (ASARS), Next Generation Sensors, DRACO, SOSA, as well as other GCWG approved projects.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Imaging and Targeting Support and Agile ISR efforts are prioritized on an annual basis by the GCWG, in accordance with the validated gaps in the Challenging Targets Initial Capabilities Document. Resulting funded efforts are then contracted for and/or executed by either various program offices, laboratories, industry, and/or other government agencies.

ASARS / High Altitude SAR technology maturation is conducted by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center/Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces (AFLCMC/WIN), in conjunction and cooperation with AFLCMC/HBG (Robins AFB) for flight test support.

Acquisition strategy is to maximize commercial and national development efforts and investment through multiple contracting methods, including the use of engineering change proposals to modify existing contracts and new contracts that were awarded both competitively or on a sole source basis.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305206F, project 674820, Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS) 2B, is a new start.

In FY2019 funding was added to Project 674820 to support ASARS2B efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of this effort is to complete ASARS-2B technology demonstration non-recurring engineering,and test activities in preparation for follow-on production/fielding. These efforts will consist of non-recurring engineering, fabrication, integration, as well as testing of the ASARS-2B radar system based upon high altitude ISR radar system requirements in the U-2 Operational Requirements Document and approved AF Form 1067s. 
Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning. 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver technology and sensor capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) is the DoD simulation/training system of choice for many Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), RPA, and ISR systems. MUSE is also know as the Air Force Synthetic Environment for Reconnaissance and Surveillance (AFSERS) in its Air Force Application. The MUSE/AFSERS is a software suite that simulates ISE &amp; strike systems, tailored air vehicle &amp; data links, and visualization systems used for payload product outputs-including Full Motion Video (FMV), Still Frame Imagery, or GMTO data. Air vehicles, sensors, datalinks, takeoff and landing systems, and to some degree, surrogate UAS and RPA ground stations, when actual ground stations are unavailable. FMV, still frame imagery, or GMTI data are provided. Outputs are compliant with applicable DoD standards and are continually tested against actual ground ISR processors to ensure interoperability with over 40 systems within DoD.  

The Services and combatant commanders have a requirement for the capability to train with a system that provides a real-time simulation environment containing multiple intelligence systems that can be integrated with larger force-on-force simulations. The MUSE/AFSERS creates a realistic operational environment which supports the ability to assess military utility, architecture and concept of employment development, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures refinement, conduct emerging concepts experimentation, and optimize C4ISR within warfighting exercises and experiments. It is the preferred simulation system used by the combatant commanders and Joint Services to support command and battle staff C4ISR training.

The MUSE/AFSERS also creates a realistic operational environment that supports: an embedded training capability for multiple Program Managers; tools to minimize acquisition and life cycle cost and schedule impacts; ability to conduct emerging concepts experimentation, future systems exploration, systems integration, and technology insertion; applications for Joint and Service-specific warfighting exercises; and C4ISR optimization.

MUSE/AFSERS is currently in use within all Services and most unified commands simulating MQ-1, MQ-9, RQ-4, MQ-1C, M/RQ-5, RQ-7, national and commercial satellite collectors, P-3, E-8, and the U-2. During warfighting exercises, the AFSERS provides imagery simulations with associated C4ISR systems to support the execution of critical imagery processes. The MUSE/AFSERS is also used as a mission rehearsal tool for current, on-going military combat operations.

The Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is the center of excellence that supports the UAS and RPA programs within the services by providing the system engineering, test and integration, interoperability, rapid technology insertion and training to address MUSE/AFSERS requirements. For those assets normally not available for training, the JTC/SIL provides surrogate systems and interfaces. The JTC/SIL contributes to the distributed training environments, virtually linking participants from various locations worldwide, and are routinely supported within the MUSE architecture.

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Gorgon Stare system is a podded airborne sensor suite that provides city-sized wide area airborne surveillance and is integrated on specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper RPA.  The Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) approved Air Combat Command's recommendation to transition Gorgon Stare from a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to an Air Force Enduring Capability in November 2014. Gorgon Stare's requirements are documented in the Gorgon Stare Wide Area Airborne Sensor Capabilities Production Document (draft).  The acquisition strategy for this Air Force podded sensor suite solution is sustainment of the currently fielded capabilities with any upgrades implemented via validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.  

Development efforts conducted with FY 2015 Congressionally-added funds included efforts focused primarily on the development of a Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability in support of an Urgent Operational Need.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2016 Congressionally-added RDT&amp;E funds included further development and system integration lab testing of Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF) with Gorgon Stare Increment 2 Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) sensors.  Funds spent on NVDF will provide a ramp for future airborne integration efforts as required.  Development efforts conducted with FY 2017 Congressionally-added funds further development efforts associated with BLOS, to include first article testing for phase 1 delivery to the field, expected late FY 2018.  

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution as well as future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The wide area airborne surveillance requirement is being delivered via the Gorgon Stare podded wide area motion imagery sensor suite integrated on dedicated, specially-modified MQ-9 Reaper RPA. Gorgon Stare transitioned from a QRC to an Air Force Enduring Capability under AFROC authority in November 2014. The program is executed by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and Special Operations Forces Directorate as a post-MS C program. The sensor suite will be sustained in its current configuration. Any future capability upgrades will be fielded as a result of validated -1067s or Urgent Operational Needs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

This sensor will be employed on airborne platforms, such as the MQ-9 Reaper.

Activities also include studies, analysis, and technology development, maturation, and demonstration to support current and future program planning and execution.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Associated ground systems include RIVET JOINT Mission Trainers (RJMT, a.k.a. mission crew simulators), Ground Data Processing Systems (GDPS), Distributed Mission Shelters (DMS), Mission Crew Training Systems (MCTS), Airborne Capabilities Extension System (ACES), and the Operational Flight Trainers (OFT, a.k.a. flight deck simulators).  Extensive utilization of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based solutions allows rapid fielding of needed capabilities through upgrades and supports Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) logistics mitigation efforts.  The results of these efforts provide for preliminary assessments of technical feasibility, operability, or military utility as well as specific engineering implementations for integration into the various systems baseline configurations.  

These activities are managed by the Air Force through the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (645 AESG).  The 645 AESG (a.k.a. BIG SAFARI Systems Program Office or SPO) manages engineering, ground and support systems modifications, integration, flight testing, product assurance, acceptance testing, logistics, and training activities.  

Aircraft, sensor systems, and associated ground support system engineering planned for FY 2019 budget includes developmental planning, execution and support for the RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT Baselines 12 and 13 (BL-12 and BL-13), the RC-135U COMBAT SENT Baselines 5 and 6 (BL-5 and BL-6), and the RC-135S COBRA BALL BL-5 and BL-6 configurations.  The world-wide challenge of keeping pace against technologically agile targets used by both nation and non-nation-state adversaries and the rapid evolution of COTS technologies demands a responsive and adaptive acquisition strategy for fielding incremental spiral upgrades and baseline capabilities that are logistically supportable at all locations.  The 645 AESG uses an incremental baseline strategy to mitigate risk, find affordable solutions and field needed capabilities on the aircraft and associated ground support and training systems.  Obsolescence and DMS/VVI logistical concerns are addressed with each baseline upgrade strategy and assessed annually as part of the fleet sustainment responsibilities.  

RIVET JOINT BL-12 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, increased digital signal exploitation, increased digital signal recorder bandwidth, enhanced spatial processing/exploitation, enhanced weather radar, digitally enhanced electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), continued Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) compliant cockpit avionics enhancements, Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) interoperability, operator work station 3-D map projection, enhanced operator reporting management tools, modernized communications security (COMSEC) protocols, and a new steerable beam antenna.  RIVET JOINT BL-13 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, providing a continuous recording capability, Super Wideband Compressive Receiver (SWCR) and Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR), CNS/ATM avionics upgrades such as new autopilot, automated data system-broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode 5 identify friendly or foe (IFF) systems, and family of beyond-line-of-sight terminals (FAB-T) advanced extremely high frequency (AEHF) communications suite. 

COMBAT SENT BL-5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, active ranging and theater networked geo-location (TNG) capability, cooling duct and lighting improvements, RJ Baseline 11 (BL-11) communications intelligence (COMINT), upgraded computer architecture, wideband global satellite (WGS) communications enhanced integration, development of an airborne tracking system, communications upgrade to include Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J), and continued CNS/ATM compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COMBAT SENT BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, steerable beams for the COMINT sub-system, improved SWCR capability and specific emitter identification (SEI) electronic intelligence (ELINT) sub-system, Primary Sensor Measurement System (PRISMS) merge with manual precision collections, millimeter wave and low band capabilities with PRISMS, digitizing antennas, direction finding of High Frequency signals and expanded streaming audio services and 360 degree aircraft tracking system. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0305206G.

COBRA BALL BL-5 upgrades consist of, but are not limited to, RJ BL-11 COMINT, WGS communications enhanced integration, communications upgrades to include MIDS-J and an intercom system (FORCE), and continued CNS/ATM compliant cockpit avionics enhancements.  COBRA BALL BL-6 developmental enhancements consist of, but are not limited to, high gain S-Band antenna, large format Sapphire windows, RJ BL-13 COMINT capability, foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT) analog to digital receiver, and Brave version of the digital cockpit avionics systems to continue CNS/ATM compliance initiatives. BL-6 RDT&amp;E is funded via PE 0301314F. 

Ground Systems Baseline upgrades add the capabilities found in the corresponding RIVET JOINT Baseline upgrades (i.e., RIVET JOINT BL-11 corresponds to Ground System BL-11, RIVET JOINT BL-12 corresponds to Ground System BL-12, RIVET JOINT BL-13 corresponds to Ground System BL-13) to the Ground Systems to ensure crews receive training on the appropriate mission system configurations.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RC-135 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities and meet emerging and urgent operational needs.  These efforts will also integrate commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades to provide current technologies and achieve necessary application services.  The next series of upgrades will meet the operational need to integrate new and/or improved sensor capabilities, as well as enhance interoperability by migrating to an Open Architecture (OA) to improve data sharing ability per DoD direction.

Program management consists of eight ACAT III efforts: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation, Sensor Integration, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): 

1. *GB 4.1: The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.
2. GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. *SR 3.0: The Systems Release (3.0) effort completes SIGINT Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system. Provides the ability to PCPAD the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) family of systems and integrates the Common Intelligence Collections System (CICS) capability. 
4. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrate new capabilities, leverage mission partner methods and tools, exchange data, and migrate the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
5. *Sensor Integration: The Sensor Integration effort rapidly integrates AF, Joint, &amp; Coalition Sensor data into DCGS Enterprise to ingest data, perform sensor planning, and Command &amp; Control.
6. Multi-INT: Provides and supports Open Architecture (OA)-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware, a virtual desktop environment, and facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools.
7. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
8.*DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
*For FY19, this effort does not have any associated RDT&amp;E funding.  The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation (WSC846080, DCGS-AF).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY 2017, $11.550M Request for Additional Appropriations was denied in the FY 2017 Appropriations Act.

In FY 2019 Base, the AF transferred $2.403M from the Project SUTER effort in PE 0305221F, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting to PE 0305208F. The AF also transferred $1.019M for the Automatic Target Recognition effort from PE 0305208F to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems. These transfers result in the $1.384M aggregate reported on the "Other Adjustment" line.

In FY 2019 OCO, $3.5M add reflects the AF request for OCO funding for the Full Motion Video (FMV) Geo-Coordination (Geo-Coord) Accuracy effort.

Due to a database error, the additional $26M in FY 2019 OCO for "MQ-9 Development and Fielding" (Project 675246) was erroneously placed in PE 0305208F but belongs in PE 0305829F,"Video Data Link". The error will be fixed during the next President's Budget cycle.  This effort is a new start and will provide situational awareness (SA) to the operator on the ground using real time Full Motion Video (FMV) from secure line of sight links to airborne ISR and other platforms. The FY19 OCO is for further system development of the Mounted and Airborne Video Data Link (MAVDL). Focus areas will be Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking, updated cryptographic hardware, and improved waveforms for LPI/LPD (Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection)
operations.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305208F, project 674826, Sensor Integration, is a new start.

In FY 2019, PE 0305221F, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER efforts were transferred to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems, in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.

In FY 2019, PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Automated Target Recognition (ATR) effort was transferred to PE 0305206F, Airborne Reconnaissance Systems, Project 674818, Imaging and Targeting Support, in order to align funding with like ATR development efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is the Combat Air Force (CAF) weapon system architecture for planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis and production, and dissemination (PCPAD) of data from Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Since AF DCGS is also a major component of the DoD DCGS, the system is designed to complement and interoperate with the DoD, Army, Navy and Marine Corps DCGS. The AF DCGS mission is to provide Joint Task Force (JTF) Commanders, Air Component Commanders, Unified Commands, and other directed organizations with global, time-sensitive ISR PCPAD across the spectrum of military operations. AF DCGS is a multi-INT network linked weapon system (AN/GSQ-272) capable of exploiting intelligence data from manned platforms, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), non-traditional ISR platforms, national and commercial satellites, and other collection systems. AF DCGS is designed to support joint operational requirements by providing a common PCPAD means to provide time-sensitive intelligence to field commanders and in support of the Air Operations Center (AOC) mission requirements. Currently, the AF DCGS worldwide architecture is composed of two worldwide core sites, three regional core sites, two remote Air Force Forces (AF FOR) sites, four National Mission Partner (NMP) sites, three support sites, and multiple National Guard Bureau (NGB) sites. Currently, AF DCGS is supporting ongoing operations from forward deployed and in-garrison CONUS and OCONUS based locations. The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. AF DCGS provides the national leadership and the warfighter with integrated and interoperable national and airborne reconnaissance by providing quality and fused Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) tailored to the warfighter for all levels of conflict.  

AF DCGS is transforming by integrating the necessary technologies and tools to provide increased capabilities, meet emerging/urgent operational needs, and enable Multi-Domain Awareness. This transformation maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf upgrades.  The next series of upgrades is migrating the Weapon System to an Open Architecture (OA) environment to meet the operational need to rapidly integrate new/improved sensor capabilities, integrate big data and machine learning, as well as enhance interoperability and improve data sharing per DoD direction.

Project SUTER effort being moved from PE 0305221F to PE 0305208F in FY19. SUTER develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network.

Program management consists of eight ACAT III efforts: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation, Sensor Integration, Multi-INT, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT): 

1. *GB 4.1: The GEOINT Baseline 4.1 (GB4.1) effort completes the Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system.  It also integrates Airborne Cuing and Exploitation System, Hyper Spectral ACES-HY (MQ-1) and Global Hawk (GH) Block 40 capability into AF DCGS.
2. GEOINT Transformation: The GEOINT Transformation effort rapidly integrates new capabilities and migrates GEOINT-specific applications &amp; capabilities into the open architecture framework.
3. *SR 3.0: The Systems Release (3.0) effort completes SIGINT Bulk Release process and provides a common baseline across the weapon system. Provides the ability to PCPAD the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) family of systems and integrates the Common Intelligence Collections System (CICS) capability. 
4. SIGINT Transformation: Rapidly integrates new capabilities, leverages mission partner methods and tools, improves data exchange, and migrates the SIGINT-specific applications/capabilities into the open architecture framework. 
5. Sensor Integration: The Sensor Integration effort rapidly integrates AF, Joint, &amp; Coalition Sensor data into DCGS Enterprise to ingest data, perform sensor planning, and Command &amp; Control.
6. Multi-INT: Provides and supports Open Architecture (OA)-based Enterprise Services, moves to commodity hardware and a virtual desktop environment, facilitates enterprise-wide collaborative tools, and integrates SUTER efforts into OA DCGS.
7. Network Infrastructure Transformation: The Infrastructure Transformation effort modernizes the AF DCGS infrastructure to improve data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities while migrating the network toward a cloud architecture.
8.*DRT: The Air Force DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT) effort provides data ingest, transfer, and storage capabilities for NGA reference imagery data.

NOTES:
*For FY19, this effort does not have any associated RDT&amp;E funding.  The Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF) funding is exhibited in the Procurement Documentation (WSC846080, DCGS-AF).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AF DCGS acquisition strategy is to transition the weapon system to an open hardware and software architecture.  Also, the strategy leverages approved lean and agile industry practices to increase delivery cycles and incorporates remote installation capabilities to speed up the installation tempo.

Contracting strategy involves a combination of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts awarded to execute program funds and delivery/task orders are negotiated/awarded individually.

The program is managed as eight ACAT III efforts: GEOINT (GB 4.1), GEOINT Transformation, Systems Release (SR 3.0), SIGINT Transformation, Sensor Integration, Multi-INT-1, Network Infrastructure Transformation, and DCGS Reference Imagery Transition (DRT).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Due to a Database Error, the additional $26M in FY19 OCO for "MQ-9 Development and Fielding" (Project 675246) was erroneously added to PE 0305208. This funding belongs in Air Force PE 0305829F,"Video Data Link". 

Video Data Link (VDL) Family of Systems (FoS) provides situational awareness (SA) to the operator on the ground using real time Full Motion Video (FMV) from secure line of sight links to airborne ISR, NTISR, PR and SF platforms.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F,
0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.


BA-7 This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development effort to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>--VDL FoS consists of interoperable Mounted (Airborne/Ground) and Handheld
terminal variants. Current variants are utilized with 20 different
platforms.

--Crypto Core Modernization (CCM) driven by NSA will create an imminent DMS
issue by FY21; the current VDL equipment is incompatible with the enhanced
Crypto Core.

--FY19 OCO - MAVDL system development project will provide technology
refresh for Mounted and Airborne Video Data Link.   Focus areas will be
Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking, updated cryptographic hardware, and improved
waveforms for LPI/LPD  (Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of
Detection) operation.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The sum of all Prior Years is actually $2031.377 million more than the represented total due to several projects ending.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element funds related Air Force projects sharing the RQ-4 platform in common: the RQ-4 Block 30, the RQ-4 Block 40, the RQ-4 Ground Segment/Communication System, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, and Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP).   The RQ-4 Block 30, Block 40, and Ground Segment/Communications Segment projects support the development and testing of the baseline ACAT 1C RQ-4 capability and the initiation of the major modernization ACAT programs.  The majority of modernization funding was transferred to the Capability Enhancements project to support upgrades and modifications to the fielded RQ-4 weapon system to meet evolving threats and warfighter requirements.  The MP-RTIP project completes development and testing of the baseline MDAP MP-RTIP sensor capability.

When judged feasible and affordable, this program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Studies and activities may be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aeriel System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI) or the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS) and Open Mission Systems (OMS). Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) will incorporate UCI and UCS standards.

Per direction of USD(AT&amp;L), the RQ-4 program was restructured from the original project 675144 (Baseline) into multiple projects: (1) Block 30, (2) Block 40, (3) GroundSegment/Communications System, and (4) Common-Airborne Sense and Avoid (C-ABSAA). In FY17 the Ground Segment/Communications System project (675147) ended. Prior year funds in the amount of $2031.377M were accounted for in project 675144 and $85.375M were accounted for in project 675147.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

The FY2017 funding was reduced by $11.500 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 30 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for Block 30 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) sensors, the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), and alternate sensor payloads.

This funding also supports aircraft systems ugrades to include continuing airframe updates, aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, airspace and interoperability enhancements, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).

Activities include mission planning interoperability enhancements, weather capability enhancements and testing, airspace and interoperability enhancements and updates, airframe and software upgrades and deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, sensor interoperability and communication enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades, upgrades to ASIP Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sensor, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) development and testing, development and testing activities associated with enhancing sensor capability and sensor integration, integration of alternate sensors, development and testing of ice protection system, support of demonstration/development and technology insertion, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services, and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploration &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.  The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), or Open Mission Systems (OMS) as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, system upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.  MS-177 Sensor Enhancement RDT&amp;E is being contracted directly with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), United Technology Corporation Aerospace Systems (UTAS).

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The RQ-4 Block 40 Project was directed by an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) signed 14 Jun 2011 by USD (AT&amp;L). At the time of the ADM signature, and subsequent designation of projects, budgets had already been finalized.  Prior budgets for all projects are captured under the RQ-4 Baseline project, as its related Project (675144) was the core project for the RQ-4 program prior to the directed restructure.

In FY 2019,  PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675146, RQ-4 Block 40, efforts were transferred to PE 0305220F, RQ-4 UAV, Project 675149, RQ-4 Capability Enhancements, in order to allow greater visibility into Global Hawk modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. 

RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 40 aircraft, including further development, creation of additional radar modes, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities. The Block 40 program provides critical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data to the warfighter. This funding also supports continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade to include Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/ADS-B, mission planning upgrade development and testing, airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, enhanced weather capability, development and testing of ice protection system, additional radar modes, sensor enhancements, reliability and maintainability improvements, and support of demonstration and technology insertion. Funding continues RQ-4 unique development and integration of upgraded capabilities. 

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.  Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), or Open Mission Systems (OMS) as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).

The RQ-4 program will maintain capability and interoperability for Block 40 including efforts with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms, such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements.

Activities also include studies and analysis, support to future system enhancements, communication and interoperability enhancements, current and future program planning, and project execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: a legacy Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) "C" contract is being phased out with the completion of current efforts; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RQ-4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) provides a high altitude, deep look, long-endurance Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that complements space and other airborne collectors during peacetime, crisis, and war-fighting scenarios. RDT&amp;E funding in this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of capabilities needed to meet validated requirements for RQ-4 aircraft, including continuing aircraft system upgrade for current and  alternate sensor payloads.

This funding supports aircraft systems upgrade to include continuing aircraft operations surety, cybersecurity, information assurance, and mission critical repair of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  This will include systems engineering/program management, configuration and data management, test and evaluation, management services, DR/MIP Investigations, studies and analysis and fielding support for Block 30, Block 40, and Ground Segment/Comm System.

Activities include airspace and interoperability and communication enhancements and updates, periodic Operational Flight Program updates and releases, airframe and software upgrades, deficiency report resolution across RQ-4 fleet, sensor enhancements and alternate sensor upgrades including the MS-177 and the Optical Bar Camera (OBC), enhanced comms capabilities, support for demonstration and technology insertion, development and testing of ice protection system, enhanced mission flexibility to accommodate changes to mission objectives inflight, enhancements to support multi-domain contested environment operations, and studies and analysis supporting future system enhancements.  Additionally, this project supports design, development, integration, and testing of items needed to meet validated requirements for Block 20/30/40 aircraft, including further development, mode creation, integration and test of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor capabilities, continued aircraft/communications systems upgrade, additional radar modes, reliability and maintainability improvements, Ground Segment Modernization Program (GSMP) and Communication System Modernization Program (CSMP) efforts, as well as next generation communications capabilities. GSMP resolves fleet grounding Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and obsolescence issues associated with ground segment equipment and provides critical warfighter capabilities such as building-based multi-aircraft control. It will also enhance interoperability data dissemination as well as provide training capability. CSMP resolves critical DMS and obsolescence issues in the RQ-4 communication infrastructure and provides enhancements across the RQ-4 communication network.

RDT&amp;E funding in this project also supports design, development, integration and testing of the weapon system's legacy ground elements and communications capabilities to enhance functionality and maintain interoperability prior to GSMP/CSMP fielding.  The ground segment currently includes the Mission Control Elements (MCE), the Launch and Recovery Elements (LRE), and the networking resources required to simultaneously disseminate intelligence information while remaining compliant with DoD cybersecurity network requirements to operate on the Global Information Grid.

This project supports system engineering/program management, test and evaluation, management services and fielding support for all RQ-4 projects.  This reflects contracting/acquisition strategy for these common elements within the Global Hawk program to provide efficiencies.  

The RQ-4 program will maintain and upgrade interoperability for Blocks 20/30/40 with system of systems partners and continue to incorporate applicable synergies with other platforms such as the U.S. Navy's Triton, other RPA weapon systems, and Processing, Exploitation &amp; Dissemination (PED) elements. The networking capability for intelligence dissemination is required to provide the data transport interface between the Weapons System, Operations Centers, and external Intelligence Community customers.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver RQ-4 UAV weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program will participate in the development, testing, and implementation of international standards to enhance joint, allied, and coalition interoperability. Likewise, studies and activities will be initiated to further explore the utility of incorporating the emerging architectural standards such as the USAF Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Command and Control Initiative (UCI), the DoD's Unmanned Control Segment standards (UCS), or Open Mission Systems (OMS) as well as technology insertion activities in support of Better Buying Power (BBP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The RQ-4 program uses an evolutionary acquisition strategy to provide the warfighter with a near-term combat capability with increased time-phased capability improvements as technology and risk achieve satisfactory levels. Northrop Grumman Corporation is the prime contractor. A suite of contract vehicles is used for development efforts: primarily, IDIQ contracts cover development, upgrade, production, retrofit, fielding, and sustainment efforts.

The program successfully completed Milestone (MS) C in February 2015 and is transitioning core program activities to the Operations and Support phase of the Defense Acquisition System over the next several years. Future required capabilities beyond the core Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC RQ-4 program will be completed as separate ACAT II and ACAT III modification programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY09, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) funding was transferred to program 0305220F (RQ-4) Global Hawk (GH).  Therefore, the data in this package includes only FY09 and subsequent funding related to program 0305220F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MP-RTIP sensor was designed as a family of modular, scalable sensors to provide next generation capabilities to support sustainable network centric operations with integrated Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) capability. MP-RTIP provides the RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft with advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Moving Target Indicator (MTI) sensor capabilities.

This project (67RTIP) includes MP-RTIP modernization and integration efforts for the RQ-4 Block 40 Platform. MP-RTIP modernization studies and development insertion include the implementation of Maritime Modes (MM), Maritime Inverse SAR(MISAR), product improvements and other advanced capabilities. GH Program Office will continue integration of radar capabilities to include Maritime Modes integration into RQ-4 aircraft and ground systems. 

Activities also include studies and analysis supporting current and future program planning and future modes development based on user requirements. This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MPRTIP weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F,0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, PE 0305221F, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER efforts were transferred to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems, in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies and sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools can include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions. NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems (for example Operations Interfaces, Network Controllers, Fusion Engines, Data Guards, Interface to Command &amp; Control, and Interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO)), the migration of the NCCT technologies to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund the integration of PIMs and associated improvements to core technology software for their respective platform. Development funds are required for software modifications and necessary for continuous modernization and software technologies associated with automation, data fusion, and information assurance/cyber security while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). FY 2018 RDT&amp;E funding addresses Air Combat Command's validated requirement for the continuous operation of NCCT within the current tactical battlespace of today as well as development in the Core Technology to provide enhanced capabilities for the strategy of operating in highly contested and Anti-Access environments.

SUTER develops concepts, Tactics/Techniques/Procedures (TTPs) and technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of communications network. Suter's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and IP communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency (RF) and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SUTER Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Center (JIOWC), etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement/ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions. SUTER is the technology that assists Combatant Commanders and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SUTER provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based C2ISR platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SUTER depicts a dynamic, multi-security-level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SUTER provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting COCOM and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives. FY 2018 funding is dedicated to optimizing the SUTER architecture within a commercial cloud service (C2S) environment and improve machine-to-machine (M2M) data interfaces via several Intelligence Community data sources while updating data models to existing data sources.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NCCT weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) is the Air Force program of record responsible for developing core technologies to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of core technologies can include, but are not limited to, Signals Intelligence to Signals Intelligence (SIGINT-SIGINT) correlation and Ground Moving Target Indicator to Signals Intelligence (GMTI-SIGINT) correlation. 

NCCT software applications employ Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to coordinate sensor cross-cues and collection activities. NCCT correlation and fusion services ingest collection data to produce a single, composite track (geo-location and identification) for high-value targets. NCCT research and development funding supports evolutionary development of the NCCT message set and network management systems. Examples include upgrades to operations interfaces, network controllers, fusion engines, data guards, interface to command &amp; control, interface to Overhead Intelligence Operations (OIO), the migration of NCCT to emerging network centric technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), global web-enabled services, and satisfying DoD standards and Information Assurance requirements.

NCCT Core Technology develops the hardware and software to horizontally integrate dissimilar Joint and Coalition Battle Management, Command &amp; Control (BMC2), and ISR assets and systems into integrated target tracks shared across networked platforms. NCCT Core Technology includes, but is not limited to, network management software, operator interfaces, standard network messages and formats, correlation software and data rules of interaction, NCCT multi-level security hardware and software items, and platform specific Platform Interface Modules (PIMs). Prospective Coalition, Joint or Service systems are required to fund the integration of PIMs and associated improvements to core technology software for their respective platform.  Development funds are required for software modifications and necessary for continuous modernization and software technologies associated with automation, data fusion, and information assurance/cyber security while keeping pace with evolving adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  FY 2019 RDT&amp;E funding addresses Air Combat Command's validated requirement for the continuous operation of NCCT within the tactical battlespace of today as well as development in the Core Technology to provide enhanced capabilities for the strategy of operating in highly contested and Anti-Access environments.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2019, PE 0305221F, Network-Centric Collaborative Targeting, Project 675275, SUTER efforts were transferred to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems, in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SUTER is a project responsible for developing sub-nodal analysis tools to horizontally and/or vertically integrate network collaborative Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor systems within and across intelligence disciplines. Operational uses of sub-nodal analysis tools would include, but are not limited to, determining which nodes of the adversary's C4I network are engaged or protected to achieve desired effects, and modeling execution plans to determine the need to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points in order to redirect activities based on changing battlefield conditions.

SUTER develops technologies for synchronizing the capabilities of ISR and non-kinetic capabilities in a coordinated fashion with traditional kinetic weapons to prosecute targets connected together or dependent upon some form of network. SUTER's planning, execution and assessment capability is implemented in a virtual architecture available to all Air Operations Centers (AOCs), taking advantage of the military value added from the synergies of Joint composite ISR, non-kinetic, and/or kinetic strike packages operating against networked target sets. This virtualized Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizes software applications which employ machine-to-machine interfaces and Internet Protocol (IP) communications to impact these target sets by "attacking" or influencing/shaping links, nodes or end points in the network to include: Radio Frequency (RF) and terrestrial links, switches, routers, hubs, servers, IP addresses, cell phones, antennas, radars, microwave relays, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) receivers, transceivers, etc. The three main pieces of the SUTER Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: first, the use of SUTER's sub-nodal analysis software to determine which nodes of the adversary's C4I network to engage or protect to achieve desired effects; second, the use of SUTER's distributed operations architecture to tie together relevant planning cells (e.g. AOCs, Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC), etc.) so they can collaborate in developing and modeling the execution plan(s) needed to disrupt or monitor the required network aim-points; and third, via SUTER's combined network Graphical User Interface (GUI), all involved "players" monitor the plan's execution, provide Near-Real Time (NRT) updates to the status of on-going activities, provide continuous assessment/updates of the execution of the plan, and, within authorities (Rules of Engagement or ROEs), re-direct activities based on changing battlefield conditions.

SUTER is the technology that assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Components to exercise synchronized dynamic Command and Control (C2) of ISR, kinetic and non-kinetic Joint operations against conventional and terrorist threat networks. SUTER provides decision makers and operators supporting airborne, ship-borne, cyber and land-based Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and at supporting locations continuous Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA) of the information superiority fight. It also incorporates the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) capabilities that rapidly synchronize the employment of kinetic weapons, non-kinetic weapons and ISR assets to target challenging threat systems responsively. SUTER depicts a dynamic, multi-security level picture of current and predicted threat network status, capitalizing on data inputs from sources such as Modernized Intelligence Database (MIDB), Net-Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT), Joint Targeting Database (JTDB), Computer Network Operations Database (CNODB), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Links and Nodes, and Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). SUTER provides a GUI that can be tailored to support the integration of ISR, kinetic, and non-kinetic composite target packages supporting Combatant Commands and Component specified information superiority effects and objectives across the full spectrum of conflict from tactical operations to an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategy. FY 2018 funding is dedicated to optimizing the SUTER mission application within an enterprise environment and develop machine-to-machine (M2M) data interfaces via several Department of Defense and Intelligence Community data sources while enhancing and updating data models to existing data sources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Prior to FY 2017, SUTER capabilities were developed, maintained and sustained with baseline/incremental upgrades plus any Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) developments acquired through the 645 AESG. In FY 2017, due to software limitations and a lack of technical maturity of SUTER's capabilities, the Air Force decided not to proceed with the 645 AESG technical plan on SUTER and transitioned SUTER program execution responsibilities to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFRL is increasing the technical maturity of the SUTER software and capabilities to a level suitable for operational capability and for transition to PE 0305208F, Distributed Common Ground/Surface Systems, Project 674826, Common Imagery Ground/Surface Systems. This transition will be made in order to facilitate the development and integration of SUTER as a mission application on Open Architecture (OA) DCGS.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds the U.S. contribution to the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Direct Commercial Sale acquisition.  AGS is an airborne ground surveillance capability that provides continuous, wide area surveillance in all weather conditions.  It will provide NATO decision makers with near real time information and situational awareness concerning friendly, neutral and opposing ground and maritime forces to support mission planning and execution, including force protection and targeting.  All NATO nations will have access to AGS collection data, creating opportunities for burden sharing with similar U.S. assets.  

The AGS program includes: air and ground segment acquisitions, operations of the NATO AGS Management Agency (NAGSMA), development of operations and support concepts and definition and establishment of an initial support capability.  The air segment consists of five (5) air vehicles based on unique exportable configurations of the United States Air Force Global Hawk air frame, Navy Triton command and control architecture and the U.S. Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) radar.  The U.S. will also integrate new Maritime Moving Target and Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar capability into the MP-RTIP radar for NATO AGS.  The ground segment consists of fixed site and transportable/mobile ground stations for air vehicle Command and Control (C2), data exploitation and distribution.  Operations and continuing In-Service Support will be funded through a future NATO Military Commanders' Capability Package funded within the NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP).

U.S. participation in NATO AGS was ratified by Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) signature/approval of the NATO AGS Program Memorandum of Understanding (PMOU) in June 2009 and includes 15 nations. In FY 2012, OSD transferred the NATO AGS program to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for management and execution of the Research and Development effort.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds 1) the Distributed Common Ground/Surface Multi-Service Execution Team (MET) Office (DMO) which oversees the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) Development and the DCGS Test and Community Support (D-TACS) Programs, 2) the Support to DCGS Enterprise Integrated Product Team (IPT) effort, and 3) the Imagery Processing effort which consists of the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) program.

1) The DMO is the persistent, working level organization supporting the DCGS Family of Systems (FoS) interoperability efforts, for which the AF is lead service. The DCGS FoS, including AF DCGS, was directed to migrate to a net-centric DoD Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) enterprise, enabling the Services to operate and share intelligence products more effectively in a joint environment. All Services must pursue a common path based on a set of common enterprise services consistent with the Department's net-centric vision while maintaining flexibility to support the full range of warfighter missions. Specifically, DoD charged the Air Force to lead the development, upgrade, integration, test, and maintenance of the common DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) enterprise services. The DIB is a set of enterprise standards and services that enable interoperability and component reuse. All the military Services are mandated to incorporate DIB interoperability standards through the Service DCGS Programs of Record (PoR), and are committed to DIB architecture as the migration path to common DCGS enterprise services. The DCGS FoS is the core of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E), and the DIB forms the core of current DI2E interoperability. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

To carry out its mission, the DMO manages multiple development and test programs. The DIB Development Program is responsible for DIB Development and the DCGS Test and Community Support (D-TACS) Program provides software test, Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V), and cybersecurity development for the products developed by the DIB Development Program. The D-TACS Program also provides a wide range of Community Support to the PoRs and the DCGS Enterprise, including Cybersecurity support. The Cybersecurity effort improves DCGS Enterprise Cybersecurity practices, including reciprocity. It also involves the development and review
of new Cybersecurity practices within the US Government, including providing commentary to the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) and DoD Risk Management Framework Technical Advisory Group (RMF TAG) as directed by the DMO.

The D-TACS Program manages the DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) at Hanscom AFB, MA and a mobile DCGS-Imagery (DCGS-I) Testbed currently located at Nellis AFB, NV. These facilities support software development and test and DI2E/DCGS Enterprise evaluation and test events and exercises.
The DCGS Test Laboratory (DTL) conducts software development, test and test development, acceptance testing, including functional verification and validation and performance testing on DIB and DIB related software.
DCGS-I Testbed is an integration and test environment, used by the Services and Agency DCGS Program Offices to conduct integration of DCGS components and test interoperability interfaces with new sensors, applications, and net-centric operations. This Testbed also supports the integration and testing of DoD DCGS components prior to introduction into the operational environment. Periodic upgrades ensure the Testbed stays current with DCGS standards and architecture. The Testbed supports the annual DCGS test event Enterprise Challenge, multiple USAF Weapons School Integration (WSINT) events, USAF Warfare Center Red Flag events and Global Hawk Interoperability Tests.

2) The Support to DCGS Enterprise IPT provides support to OUSD(I), AF DCGS and NATO interoperability efforts. This includes the development, testing, and implementation of international standards (to include NATO standardization agreements) to ensure joint, allied, and coalition interoperability.

3) The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture. The VIP-C provides end-to-end image processing to include raw data ingest, data format standardization to facilitate exploitation, secondary image processing, metadata conditioning, and image quality enhancements. Current efforts are focused on ensuring new sensors being fielded and associated data types can be processed.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF DCGS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.

This project is in Budget Activity (BA) 7 (Operational System Development) because this BA includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Imagery Processing effort develops the Virtual Imagery Processing Capability (VIP-C) within the DCGS architecture.  VIP-C accepts airborne imagery data, processes it into an exploitable format, and provides it to other elements within the weapon system and/or the DCGS Enterprise. Current efforts are transitioning the legacy imagery processor from a hardware/software capability to a virtual software capability, thereby improving enterprise processing capabilities.   Efforts continue to keep the capability on track to handle the current sensors. Activities also include testing, development, and demonstrations integrating updated and new/emerging sensors into DCGS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>International Intelligence Technology and Architectures oversees, manages, and provides the United States (US) component of the multi-national Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (US BICES) with a collaborative environment and intelligence sharing enterprise required for processing and disseminating critical intelligence information between and among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), allied and coalition forces. The US BICES program procures and maintains a standing intelligence information sharing capability across Department of Defense (DoD), Combat Support Agencies, and multiple Combatant Commands (CCMD) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (OUSD(I). At the request of OUSD(I), US BICES is extended beyond U.S. European Command (EUCOM) into all CCMDs and is known as US BICES Extended (US BICES-X). US BICES provides an "enduring" US and Coalition interoperable intelligence sharing multi-level secure technical architecture utilizing releasable elements of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) framework and functions to support the full spectrum of intelligence operations and dissemination throughout the DoD community. Also, it enables instantiation of US BICES/US BICES-X as the intelligence contribution to the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).

Research and Development funding will:

- Provide increased intelligence information sharing capabilities in support of US and coalition forces utilizing the US BICES and NATO virtual networks and provide increased database information via Distributed Common Ground System - Army.
- Expand available intelligence disciplines (Geospatial Intelligence, Signal Intelligence, and potentially Human Intelligence) to support US and allied/coalition forces.  Support increased intelligence advanced analytics tools, Joint Intelligence Operation Center-IT and DI2E developments to significantly increase the timeliness of intelligence and bring US BICES/NATO Special Operations Forces Headquarters/NATO Intelligence Fusion Center capabilities into the current technology baselines.
- Develop and provide a federated Trusted Network Environment (TNE) that incorporates the Asian Pacific intelligence Information Network to support the National Defense Strategy.
-  Provide multi-level security intelligence bi-laterals and multi-laterals to meet Combatant Commander Integrated Priority Lists.
-  Develop the Coalition Partner Network for CENTCOM, the Coalition Information Exchange Network for SOUTHCOM, and the Coalition Partner Network for EUCOM and AFRICOM.
- Expand capabilities for bi-lateral and multi-lateral federated TNEs in support of CCMD requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0305881F, project 670374, Cyber Capability Support Office, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A.1. Mission Description.
Program element includes the manpower, equipment, research and development, developmental testing, operational test and evaluation, transition funding to foundational programs, necessary facilities, legal and associated costs supporting cyber innovation through rapid development (days to months), technology transition and/or acquisition of cyber capabilities. Key areas include; defense of the Air Force Network, mission assurance capabilities to protect cyber infrastructure and attack and exploitation of networks and associated systems used by adversaries as directed by the appropriate Combatant Commander or Joint Force Commander. These capabilities will directly support interagency partners and joint forces.

A.2. Other.
May include expedited development of innovative solutions for existing and emerging technologies

A.3. Budget Item Justification.
Rapid Cyber Acquisition (RCA) provides Combatant Commanders with the ability to rapidly respond to merging cyber needs. RCA provides rapid fielding of offensive cyber capabilities in the following areas: attack, exploitation, defense, and command and control of offensive cyber operations through all phases of warfare; and new cyber operational capabilities that address cyber gaps in evolving mission areas.

RCA delivers operational cyber capabilities to 24th Air Force (24 AF) warfighters in mission-relevant timeframes. RCA provides capabilities in support of US national security interests and to enhance the nation's ability to operate in cyberspace. It expedites cyber development and modifications of USAF and DoD cyber capabilities. RCA provides solution sets for offensive cyberspace operations: attack, defense, command and control/situational awareness, exploitation, critical infrastructure support, and combat support. RCA provides integration, and technical support to other Service and Government Agency activities to leverage select Air Force-developed technologies and/or operational capabilities. RCA will develop material or non-material cyber solutions, conduct rapid prototyping, integration, and transition activities for cyber systems. Activities include, but are not limited to: development of software/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab-developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations, and risk reduction for emerging technologies. 

The Cyber Capability Support Office (CCSO) is a rapid cyber capability development organization charged with meeting AF Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO) mission requirements in support of multi-domain superiority across the 5 Air Force core missions.  By utilizing a unique blend of technology, intelligence, and operations Subject Matter Experts, CCSO develops Phase-0 focused capability to enable the achievement of the CCDR's mission requirements.

In FY19, RCA will shift focus from the rapid fielding of capability to funding a standing research and development team to conduct quick look assessments, solution design, rapid prototyping, and field quick reaction capabilities in support of urgent warfighter requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver cyber weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Rapid Cyber Acquisition utilizes a tailorable acquisition strategy that facilitates rapid delivery of material and non-material solutions to solve operational cyber needs. This approach allows flexibility for solutions to enter into the acquisitions process at any phase of the acquisitions life cycle management system. These plans meet the written acquisition planning requirements and guidance. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Rapid Cyber Acquisition considers existing contracting vehicles, including but not limited to: Network Centric Solutions (NETCENTS), NETCENTS 2, Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-2 (ITES-2), Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules, CCSO Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, HNCY Cyber IDIQ contract, National Security Agency vehicles and Cyber Warfare Systems Branch Class Justification and Approval document. Multiple award contractual vehicles, such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's SEWP IV, provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Rapid Cyber Acquisition. These multiple-award vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act and only require that Rapid Cyber Acquisition provide a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery (PR). The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across the PR network. PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide. PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions. The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities. The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of PR across the Department of Defense and other national and international entities.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver PRC2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Mission Data (IMD) encompasses several key intelligence data efforts used to support IMD-dependent programs, including the fifth generation aircraft capabilities. The term IMD encompasses Red (adversary military systems), White (commercial systems), Blue (U.S. military systems), and Grey (neutral military systems) Characteristics &amp; Performance; Signatures; Geospatial Intelligence; Electronic Warfare systems and Operational Order of Battle mission data.  The PE funds: Planning &amp; direction, collection, processing &amp; exploitation, analysis &amp; production, and dissemination (PCPAD) to support IMD-dependent programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FY19 funding was reduced by $7.245M from "C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Increment 1" to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

The FY19 funding was reduced by $20.475M from "C-130H Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) Increment 2" to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

The C-130H is a medium sized tactical transport aircraft providing multi-purpose theater support throughout the globe.  The C-130H fleet supports several diverse Air Force roles, including but not limited to tactical and inter-theater airlift and airdrop support, Arctic resupply, special operations support, aeromedical evacuation, aerial spraying, firefighting duties, and natural disaster and humanitarian relief missions.

C-130H AMP Increment 1 addresses modifications to meet airspace compliance mandates and safety requirements.  RDT&amp;E efforts cover design, integration, developmental and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

C-130H AMP Increment 2 includes digital avionics upgrades (e.g. Flight Management System, improved navigation), cockpit modernization (e.g. glass/engine flight displays) and resolves select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues.  RDT&amp;E efforts will cover software development, design, integration, developmental and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, Systems Integrated Lab (SIL) development, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program performs modifications to meet airspace compliance and safety mandates; the mod includes automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) Out, enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, and cockpit voice recorder/digital flight data recorder (CVR/DFDR).

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to, design, integration, development and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, spares and peculiar support equipment in support of trial kit installs, type 1 training and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts (including Mode 5 effort for the trainers).  Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues will be resolved with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

The C-130H AMP Increment 1 program currently modifies 176 aircraft (166x C-130Hs and 10x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 131 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft.   The modification effort will have 4 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining 172 aircraft modified in the production phase.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130H AMP Increment 2 upgrades the C-130H fleet with comprehensive avionics and cockpit modernization which replaces aging unreliable equipment and adds combat capability enhancements.  It also addresses select obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues with solutions that may include life of type buys or bridge buys.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards(SCARS)initiative.

RDT&amp;E efforts include but are not limited to software development, design, integration, development and operational test, trial kit buy and installation, technical order development validation and verification, peculiar support equipment and spares in support of trial kit installs, SIL development, type 1 training, and C-130H aircrew and maintenance training systems and courseware development efforts.

The C-130H AMP Increment 2 program currently modifies 176 aircraft (166x C-130Hs and 10x LC-130Hs) consisting of H3s, H2.5s, H2s and H1s; and includes 131 Air National Guard aircraft, and 45 Air Force Reserve aircraft.   The modification effort will have 4 prototype aircraft representative of variations in the mission designs and required for accomplishment of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the remaining 172 aircraft modified in the production phase. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130H weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>C-5 communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5 to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5 to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5 to provide oceanic controller/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5 SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5 will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-5 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-5 core mission computer (CMC)/weather radar (WxRdr) program is a comprehensive sustainment modification to mitigate the obsolescence of the current CMC and WxRdr. This effort centers around modifying the current mission computer to obtain sufficient capacity/capability to support integration of new system capabilities with margin for growth by upgrading module cards and correcting any mission essential deficiencies identified during development. Also, the effort includes replacement of the weather radar with a commercial off-the-shelf weather radar. Mission systems equipment includes, but is not limited to, a redesign of the C-5 lavatory system. Examples of other mission systems equipment include troop seats, crew entry door and ladder, and interior trim.  

The current C-5 CMC has reached maximum capacity and cannot integrate required aircraft systems and capabilities to include the weather radar; flight management system (FMS); and communication, navigation, surveillance (CNS)/air traffic management (ATM) requirements. These requirements include capabilities such as the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), and identification, friend or foe (IFF) mode 5.  The new CMC will allow for current and future throughput growth of additional processing requirements to meet calendar year 2020 CNS/ATM mandates.

The modification helps to maintain aircraft availability as the new  weather radar replaces the current APS-133 weather radar system, which is experiencing severe diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues.  Failure to upgrade the CMC to support calendar year 2020 CNS/ATM mandates and a new weather radar will create a significant operational impact. DMS issues will be resolved to support continued production and installation of requirements for the C-5 fleet. Further, DMS issues will be resolved to support continued operations through studies, bridge buys, life-of-type buys, development, and redesign efforts.

The C-5 mission systems equipment (MSE) program updates the lavatory system. The current lavatory system suffers inoperability and leakage of liquid sodium hypochlorite causing severe corrosion and burnt wires in the landing gear control panels.  A redesign of the MSE will increase safety, mitigate risk, and reduce man-hours required to repair extensive damage.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy for this project considered every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 core mission computer and weather radar and maintain aircraft availability in support of mobility missions worldwide. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure the core mission computer cards and weather radar, integrate and test those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft. The sole-source contract is predominately CPIF (Cost Plus Incentive Fee) with some FFP (Firm Fixed Price) elements.

Mission Systems Equipment program: The mission systems equipment redesign requires RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) proofing. Funds are required for validation and verification of the lavatory design and installation. The Mission Systems Equipment contract method was competitive through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Wyle Science, Technical, and Engineering Group was the selected source, and the contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>C-5 communication, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) program is a comprehensive effort to ensure appropriate CNS/ATM system design architectures are developed and equipment is installed on the C-5 to allow aircraft operation in accordance with civil airspace access mandates for both the US national airspace system (NAS) and international civil airspace. Also, the program will add equipment to meet outstanding National Security Agency mandates for encryption of voice communications. The C-5 CNS/ATM program ensures system standardization and interoperability with other DoD systems to the maximum extent possible and directly supports airworthiness certification of the C-5. CNS/ATM requirements include, but are not limited to, capabilities such as automatic dependence surveillance-broadcast out (ADS-B Out), identification friend or foe (IFF) mode 5, satellite communication equipment replacement, and beyond line-of-sight voice radio replacement. It is anticipated equipment will be predominately commercial off-the-shelf or non-developmental items.

The current ARC-210 radio for VHF voice communications is facing diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) supply issues and additionally will no longer be capable of providing secure voice communications due to the development of new crypto algorithms. Addition of next generation ARC-210 radios and associated cryptologic equipment will enable the C-5 to meet NSA mandates for secure communications and allow aircrews to continue to communicate securely over VHF, UHF, HF, or MILSATCOM.

The current generation of satellites that support services used on the C-5 to provide oceanic controller/pilot data link communications (CPDLCs) to air traffic control and aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) beyond-line-of-sight command and control messages will no longer be functional after 2016. The next generation of satellites will accommodate legacy C-5 SATCOM equipment for an interim period of time to allow for integration of upgraded SATCOM equipment compatible with this satellite constellation. Without this modification, the C-5 will be unable to fly oceanic tracks and will not be able to meet aircraft separation distance requirements for civil airspace access.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) is a next generation surveillance technology that transitions key aspects of air traffic control from terrestrial based technologies to satellite enabled technologies to provide controllers a more accurate picture of aircraft positioning. ADS-B Out will allow aircraft to provide continuous broadcast of aircraft position to both controllers and other aircraft equipped with ADS-B In capable avionics. International mandates for ADS-B Out for civil airspace access call for equipage by 2020.

Available funds in this modification are used for program management administration, change orders, and other government costs such as travel, directorate support, government furnished equipment (GFE), and over and above costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CNS/ATM program:  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for incorporation of the ARC-210 Gen V radio, SATCOM replacement equipment, ADS-B Out, and IFF mode 5 into the C-5 began in Dec 2016. The acquisition strategy for this program will consider every opportunity to use commercial components to modernize the C-5 CNS/ATM equipment to meet CY2020 mandates for global civil airspace access. The strategy is for the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Aero (LMA), to procure CNS/ATM equipment, develop software, test and integrate those components, and install on two (2) EMD aircraft.  The equipment integration will require RDT&amp;E funding for commercial off-the-shelf and non-developmental item proofing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-17 can perform the entire spectrum of airlift missions and is specifically designed to operate effectively and efficiently in both strategic and theater environments.  Airlift provides essential flexibility when responding to contingencies on short notice anywhere in the world.  It is a major element of America's national security strategy and constitutes the most responsive means of meeting mobility requirements.   Specific tasks associated with the airlift mission include deployment, employment, sustaining support, retrograde, and combat redeployment.  Not only can the C-17 deliver outsize cargo to austere tactical environments, but it also reduces ground time during air/land operations.  The C-17 will perform its airlift mission well into this century.

C-17 RDT&amp;E funding efforts support, but are not limited to:  Aircraft performance improvements and airspace access mandates (i.e., Communications/Navigation Improvements); flight test activities and facilities; development of solutions for obsolescence and safety of flight issues; systems engineering/program management administration support; support for avionics laboratories; software development, test and integration; block development/change management; proposal preparation for new projects; cost estimating and engineering/acquisition studies not related to requirements generation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-17 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

In FY19 the efforts are:  Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC), Fire Filter Mitigation, Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), Real Time In Cockpit (RTIC), and Fixed Installation Satellite Antenna (FISA), which will be covered in more detail on subsequent pages.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-130J is a medium-sized transport aircraft capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended (by 15 feet) fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the USAF combat delivery mission compared with legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short). Special mission variants of the C-130J conduct airborne psychological operations (EC-130J), weather reconnaissance (WC-130J), search and rescue (HC-130J), and special operations (MC-130J and AC-130J). All aircraft variants must be capable of worldwide operations.

This project provides RDT&amp;E funding for required capabilities that are grouped as "Block" upgrades or "Capability" updates. Content/requirements for block modifications is documented in International Program Directives (IPDs) as determined in the Cooperative Systems and Software Upgrade Requirements Management (COSSURM) process. This project will integrate the common-core capabilities developed under this program into the HC-130J, MC-130J and AC-130J.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C-130J weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operation System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C-130J aircraft will be modified using a "block upgrade" strategy. The CNS/ATM, navigation safety requirement will initially, be met in three block upgrades. Block 6.0 development was funded from FY03-07. Block 7.0 started in FY07, and Block 8.1 which began in FY12. Subsequently, C-130J modifications will be grouped into smaller CNS/ATM updates known as Capability Management Updates (CMU).  Other AMC initiatives are upgrades to hardware and software that have arisen after the formation of the block upgrades and CMUs.

In order to better manage the fleet and to avoid having to simultaneously support three separate aircraft configurations (Block 6, Block 7 and Block 8.1) the USAF has decided to combine the Block 7 and Block 8.1 mods.  This will allow the aircraft and trainers to only have to be modified one time.

The proportion of CNS/ATM and navigation safety requirements allocated to Blocks 6.0 through 8.1 was determined via a design trade study conducted by Lockheed Martin (the C-130J prime contractor) and verified by the C-130J system program office and AMC. The development costs are being shared via a global Project Arrangement (PA) by the United States (USAF, USMC, USCG), the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Canada, and Norway. An international program office (IPO), with USAF lead (Wright Patterson AFB, OH), manages the block upgrades development and CMU efforts. Retrofit of a Block on the aircraft is the responsibility of each nation.

In order to meet the Federal Aviation Administration 2020 mandate the USAF will install the Block 8.1 ADS-B Out/Mode V IFF solution on all C-130J variants not scheduled to receive Block 8.1 by January 2020.  This is Mod #8649, ADS-B Out Acceleration. All C-130Js will still require Block 8.1.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is an evolutionary acquisition program that provides significantly improved defensive systems capability for DoD aircraft to counter the infrared (IR) man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile threat. The current LAIRCM system configuration [AN/AAQ-24V] consists of missile warning sensors (MWS), a laser transmitter assembly, control interface unit and processors to detect, track, jam and counter incoming IR missiles. The number of sensors and transmitter assemblies per aircraft is determined by the size and signature of the aircraft. The system is fully automatic following system power-up. LAIRCM requirements are documented in the multi-command Operational Requirements Document (ORD) LAIRCM ORD 314-92, validated on 03 Aug 98. The system is currently installed on 54+ aircraft types and over 1200 aircraft.

The baseline program development is complete.  Follow-on efforts are addressing integration onto new aircraft types, design changes to address Reliability Maintainability &amp; Availability and system improvements to counter new and emerging threats. 

LAIRCM upgrades include, but are not limited to hardware and software upgrades and testing of the LAIRCM system to maintain defensive capability against new and emerging threats. 

Current and future efforts include Threat Analysis; Modeling, Simulation and Emulation Test; Hardware, Software and Firmware Upgrades; Virtual System Integration Lab (SIL) Development; and Studies and Analysis.

Threat Analysis: Threat analysis encompasses the activities to support threat exploitation analysis of a variety of threats (both known and emerging) against the current LAIRCM jam code with the intent of determining if jam code updates are required. Typical threat analysis activities include: Threat seeker characterization; model development for advanced threat IR seekers; development and testing of new infrared countermeasures concepts, techniques, and hardware; new technology assessment for potential incorporation into the LAIRCM system, and the evaluation/exploitation of new threats and threat characteristics relative to IRCM.

Modeling, Simulation, and Emulation Testing: Modeling, simulation, and emulation activities verify and validate the information obtained from the threat analysis activities. These activities include: Evaluation of infrared countermeasures (IRCM) techniques used in defeating real threat hardware; developing and evaluating jam code; validating and verifying integration of LAIRCM system components to newly developed jam codes, software or hardware; evaluating system effectiveness; performing platform integration support tests; and conducting predictive risk reduction tests prior to Live Missile Fire Test (LMFT) or on aircraft flight testing.

Hardware, Software, and Firmware Upgrades: Includes changes of any kind to any LAIRCM hardware components/ support equipment with the purpose of adding capability, features, and enhancements which do not presently exist to ensure the LAIRCM system remains viable against current and emerging threats.
-----Hardware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, test and produce new capabilities, features, and enhancements, and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM hardware with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist.
-----Software upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the new or modified code that result in new capabilities, features, and enhancements and changes of any kind to any portion of LAIRCM software with the purpose of adding capability, features and enhancements which do not presently exist. Software upgrades can occur in any of the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) Operation Flight Programs as well as any of the software residing in other LAIRCM associated components including those systems which support development and test or the LAIRCM support equipment.
-----Firmware upgrade activities include engineering tasks required to design, develop, and test the upgrades and those changes resulting from hardware and software updates/modifications as well as firmware upgrades which add new features.

Virtual SIL Development: Incrementally design, develop, integrate, and test software code and purchase associated infrastructure (i.e., computers, servers, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, etc.) necessary to develop and implement a virtual SIL providing a critical capability for testing the LAIRCM system to ensure continued effectiveness against current and emerging threats.

Studies and Analysis: Includes logistics, programmatic, and engineering studies and analysis activities to ensure continued system viability and sustainability and compliance with acquisition directives. These activities may include the evaluation of low cost/high payback opportunities to reduce software development/implementation cost, enhance production efficiency, and improve life cycle costs through increased reliability and reduced repair and return cost.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $1.033 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Program management and administration efforts consist of, but are not limited to, contract services and government costs. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Aircraft Survivability weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The program will replace the obsolete Inmarsat Aero-I system with an Iridium system.  Inmarsat's existing third generation satellites (I-3) which provide Aero-I services will no longer be functional after 2023.  Aero-I services are used to provide oceanic Controller/Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) to Air Traffic Control and Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) Command and Control (C2) messages to 618th Tactical Air Control Center (TACC) Global Decision Support System.  The procurement effort modifies 359 C/KC-135s and 19 Simulators. Funding may be used to address DMS issues.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-135 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F,0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The KC-10 is an aerial refueling asset built on the commercial DC-10 airframe.  This aircraft creates an air bridge enabling rapid global mobility and global strike missions.  There are 59 KC-10A aircraft in the USAF tanker fleet. KC-10 has a divestiture strategy that is to be completed in 2024.    

Mode 5 program is a FAA mandated upgrade to the USAF Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system, the primary means of command and control aircraft identification.  Mode 5 increases anti-spoofing capabilities and lowers the possibility of aircraft/aircrew loss due to misidentification of friendly aircraft.  The KC-10 modification program includes a Mode 5 capable APX-119 transponder, a new KIV-77 crypto applique and integration/control through the CDU-7000F flight management computer. 

An FAA mandated Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade to the KC-10 is also included as part of Mode 5 to meet DO-260B requirements set by the FAA. Both Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) Out are mandated programs (JROCM 047-07 and FAA Advisory Circular 20-165B) that have a required incorporation NLT 1 Jan 2020 (ADS-B) and 1 July 2020 (Mode 5).  Both modifications are accomplished by modification of the APX-119 Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and can easily be accomplished at the same time and at a significant cost savings to the USAF. 

The program includes a Technology Maturation Risk Reduction Study (TMRR), Formal EMD, Procurement and Installation on KC-10 aircraft.

BA Justification: Mode 5 and ADS-B Out are mandated are JROCM (047-07) and FAA (AC 20-165B) mandated programs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver KC-10 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>VC-25A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) assures unrestricted global access to civilian and military airspace to support the President of the United States as Head of State, Chief Executive, and Commander in Chief.  AMP upgrades use a systems approach to aid pilot awareness and alleviate task saturation enhancing safety in a high technology concentrated airspace environment.  VC-25A AMP is a required modification to ensure the viability of the Presidential support airlift fleet until the VC-25B Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program is fielded.  

AMP complies with mandates for civil Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 and provides an improved Advisory Vertical Navigation (VNAV) capability.  It will incorporate multiple subsystems, to include, but not limited to, maneuver camera system, large cockpit displays, and navigation radios to increase the utility and safety of the VC-25A.  Provisions for the military ADS-B Out will also be provided. Installations are aligned with the aircraft heavy maintenance schedule.

BA-7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>VC-25A AMP is accomplished by developmental integration of commercial off-the-shelf systems, hardware procurement and installation is accomplished to align with heavy maintenance depot schedules.  An Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) was issued in Jun 12.  The UCA was definitized with a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract April 2014.  The CPIF contract covers the engineering RDT&amp;E effort through Critical Design Review in FY15.  The remaining RDT&amp;E effort including the first kit, install and flight test was awarded in FY15 and concludes in FY18 with delivery of the first aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is the Air Force Special Operations Forces (SOF) variant of the joint multi-mission V-22 tilt rotor aircraft. The CV-22 provides long-range, high-speed infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. The Navy is the lead service for the Joint V-22 program.  The Joint Program Manager is responsible for managing all variants of the V-22.  Department of the Navy (DoN) funds the development of the MV-22 and CMV-22.  The Air Force funds the service common portion of the CV-22 while United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) funds the development and procurement of SOF peculiar systems.  CV-22 RDT&amp;E funding provides for the development, integration, and testing of mission critical aircraft modifications to improve operational effectiveness, platform survivability, and aircraft availability.  
 
Enhanced Self-Deployment:  RDT&amp;E funding provides for the design, development, and testing of aircraft modifications to improve aircraft self-deployment capabilities (e.g., operating range, global response time) to evaluate emerging threats to the aircraft and mission accomplishment, and to identify and assess emerging air vehicle, propulsion system, avionics architecture, electronic warfare, situational awareness, and weapon system capability requirements for potential solutions to satisfy these requirements.  

Nacelle Improvements:  Funds the design and development of the CV-22 nacelle to reduce ingestion of sand/dust and other particulate matter into the engine, increase engine time on wing and overall aircraft readiness/availability rates, and reduce operations and support costs.  This is Air Force Special Operations Command's #1 priority for the CV-22 weapon system. 

Other/Future Capabilities:  The CV-22 aircraft funds improved operational safety, suitability, cyber security, and mission effectiveness.  Funding also provides for future modification planning, and for aircraft engineering changes/upgrades to address diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) and component obsolescence issues adversely affecting aircraft readiness and operational availability rates. 
 
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CV-22 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The V-22 Joint Program Office (Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), PMA-275) is developing new capabilities for the V-22 in block increments.  

--Nacelle Improvements:  NAVAIRSYSCOM plans to award a cost plus fixed fee contract for Nacelle Improvements by QTR3 FY2018. IRS and GCU will utilize some combination of sole source and competitive contracts. 

--Enhanced Self-Deployment Capabilities: The Army Technology Applications Program Office at Ft Eustis awarded a FFP contract in June 2016 for LRU-1 Ethernet design (IBR).  The FY2018 plan is to add incremental funding for LRU-1 Ethernet (IBR) design to the existing contract. 

Development activities for the V-22 program to date have been primarily performed by the prime contractor, Bell-Boeing, on a sole-source basis.  Bell-Boeing is a strategic partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Integrated Defense Systems.  Efforts are underway to increase competition where feasible, depending primarily on the level of platform integration required.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>Block 20 Development Target Value of Contract differs from total cost because most of the Block 20 development cost was funded in PE 0401318F, BA05.  In addition, the SOF peculiar development efforts were funded by USSOCOM MFP-11 funding.

Nacelle Improvements Development Target Value of Contract differs from total cost because this is a joint development funded by Navy and Air Force.  

Prior Years funding ($322.656M) was executed in PE 0401318F, BA05.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification

Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) Increment 1.
The CAMPS Increment I program is the primary critical joint requirements management system for Special Assignment Air Mission (SAAM), Air Refueling (AR) scheduling, and Intra-theater air movement requests. It is also the primary USTRANSCOM and Air Mobility Command Command and Control (AMC C2) planning and scheduling tool enabling Mobility Air Force (MAF) resources to support peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. In the Air Refueling Management System (ARMS), CAMPS provides the ability to request, manage and validate requests for air refueling.  Force-level CAMPS users include the USTRANSCOM Fusion Center, 618th Air Operations Center (AOC) Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC), and other AOC Air Mobility Divisions (AMDs). Several web-based applications also support movement and air refueling requests for globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users.

The 618th AOC (TACC) is a global air operations center responsible for planning and executing airlift and air refueling missions in support of the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE). Although primarily used by the 618th AOC (TACC), CAMPS also supports validation, planning, and scheduling activities found at AMD and USTRANSCOM. CAMPS airlift and air refueling requirement management applications are available for all globally distributed Joint, Service, and Wing/Unit level users that need to request airlift or air refueling. 

The current CAMPS AR scheduling capability does not have access to all data sources necessary to maintain visibility of and support for all potential re-planning requirements and therefore can have ‘blind spots' which hinder its ability to provide robust support for planning and re-planning across the entire "initial through final” planning phase. This CAMPS Increment I (modernization) effort will build on the existing technology transitioned from RDT&amp;E initiatives.  

FY19 continues funding for Air Refueling scheduling capability development and testing to provide planners an integrated human-in-the-loop and machine-based cooperative system which provides the ability to rapidly generate and evaluate multiple potential solution candidates to satisfy  requirements.  This will increase the effectiveness and efficiency with which Air Refueling assets are employed and support increased operational agility through more, rapid, effective and efficient re-planning while minimizing the impact on currently planned mission sets.  The AR scheduling metrics component enables on-going improvement of the AR scheduling system and can be developed after extensive analysis and iterations with the constituent user sets and command authorities.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Special Tactics (ST) System Development project focuses on modernization development for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit. This program is part of the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization (BA-Mod) Program. BAO Kit will develop, test, train, and modernize the existing and future Family of Systems (FoS) that provide a state-of-the-art Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability. It also provides a suite of systems for all Air Force Specialty Codes supporting the ST community within the Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC's) Battlefield Airmen. Efforts in ST System Development focus on reducing the risk of fratricide and substantially reducing size and weight of the equipment carried through three core capabilities, which are not limited to: Human Machine Interface (HMI), Line of Sight (LOS) targeting, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) C4ISR System and all other ST capability needs.

This program will develop and enhance technologies for Battlefield Airmen ST operators to recognize, identify, range, nominate, and designate targets during both day and night operations. BAO Kit will also significantly reduce the time required to find, track, fix targets, and engage the enemy by providing highly accurate target grid coordinates in three dimensions, generating target imagery both pre- and post-strike, and transmitting target data to Command and Control centers. BAO Kit systems are light, compact, and portable for use by dismounted Battlefield Airmen. FY19 BAO Kit funding will provide significant improvements in operational capability, situational awareness, and precision lethality in the battle space while continuing to build and enhance the BAO Kit family of systems. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes, and associated engineering support to posture the BAO Kit for technology insertion.  These efforts will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increase mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum. BAO also supports AFSOC Tactical Command and Control (TAC C2) programs to develop and enhance communications systems and equipment essential for ST combat controllers, pararescue, combat weather operators, and tactical air controller parties within AFSOC to perform their mission. The ST operators use this equipment to gather and transmit assault zone suitability and weather data and to perform tactical airfield/assault landing/drop zone operations. Due to the rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements. The above efforts may change based on the need to support current Air Force mission requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver nuclear weapon support capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

The Special Tactics (ST) System Development activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

This is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program develops, tests, and evaluates national and Air Force measurement standards (hardware) and calibration equipment in support of all Air Force programs and activities, including Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) worldwide.  Metrology research and development provides technology to support systems in all phases of development and acquisition, as well as Air Force R&amp;D laboratories, test ranges, ground test facilities, and operational weapons systems support. Rapidly changing technology requires continuing research and development of measurement standards and calibration equipment to ensure modern weapon systems meet Air Force readiness objectives. This program addresses all metrology disciplines and includes the technology areas of laser, infrared, microwave, millimeter wave, optical, physical, mechanical, electrical, electronic, and ionizing radiation measurements. Metrology is a technical discipline devoted to the science of measurements and to the study and improvement of measurement technology.  Measurements are the foundation of military system development, quality assurance, hardware conformance testing and system readiness tests.  The integrity of these tests is assured through calibration and traceability assurance schemes.  The capability to measure and calibrate must parallel the emergence of new technology, new ranges, and new capabilities of military systems.  Lack of new measurement capability impedes or blocks the successful exploitation of new technologies, especially in the movement from development laboratory to production to deployment.  R&amp;D efforts are essential within the DoD to pace these requirements, otherwise, these same new systems will suffer time delays, excessive cost, and increased risk due to unreliable test results in all phases of development, production, deployment and operation.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute and deliver 0702207F.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.    

Program is managed by Air Force Materiel Command, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Air Force Metrology Division (WNM).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this BA includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current of subsequent FY.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2018 PE 0708610F, Project 675207, MROi efforts were transferred to PE 0708055F, Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul System, Project 675207, Maintenance Repair and Overhaul, in order to improve transparency of this ACAT I acquisition program.

Prior Years Funding $23.741M was executed in PE 0708610F.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul is an enterprise resource planning IT system that provides an integrated capability for planning, scheduling, and executing organic depot maintenance to support agile planning, optimized workload assignment and resource allocation.

MROi creates an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter.

FY 2019 funding will support the development and integration of MROi, leading to a planned Full Deployment Decision/Full Deployment ATP (Authority to Proceed).  The MROi implementer will continue to configure the Oracle suite; configure associated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) support software; develop Reports, Interfaces, Conversions and Extensions (RICE) software; and develop training materials.  Development Testing (DT) activities will begin.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MROi system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF requires an integrated logistics capability that provides timely, accurate and reliable information to decision makers at all levels of command and across the full range of military operations.  

FIAR and Software Upgrades:

The remediation and modification of core logistics systems is necessary for the AF to meet statutory Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) and align with the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-4 Concept for Logistics, and the AF Logistics Board's approved Enterprise Logistics Strategy (ELS).  The AF must sustain and modernize these systems through FIAR Remediation, to address the most immediate gaps in meeting FIAR by the statutory deadline, and software upgrades, to reduce high operating costs, implement statutory compliance requirements and improve near term system performance, and system consolidation efforts.

Systems contained in these business areas include, but are not limited to, the Combat Ammunitions System (CAS), Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S), AF Equipment Management System (AFEMS), Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS),  Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), and Stock Control System (SCS). 
Transformation:

The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term.  The objective of transformation is to conduct Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to identify and eliminate overlaps in our current processes and where appropriate, implement the use of new IT systems.  

The AF Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) was applied as part of this BPR effort to apply discipline and focus to the task of process reengineering and requirements development in order to reduce risk and successfully transform logistics IT systems.  In the SDDP, the requirements definition, architecture and design for an IT capability is a government-owned process.  The SDDP ensured the AF end user and Sponsor consider all possible doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel and facility solutions to the end user's need/problem before a materiel solution is sought.  The SDDP is a six-step process, each step with its own specific product outcomes that serve as the basis for downstream activities in the SDDP and facilitating enterprise-level analysis to maximize reuse of existing capabilities.  Maximizing reuse will eliminate duplicate implementation actions across the AF and assure individual user problems or needs are not solved at the cost of overall enterprise benefits.  The outcome of using the SDDP is a well-described requirement which may include a materiel solution, in which case the SDDP details the acquisition and implementation activities to support delivery of the capability.  Alternatively, success may be demonstrated by the resolution of the user's problem without a materiel solution.  

The AF logistics enterprise is comprised of multiple overarching functional areas, to include maintenance, repair and overhaul, end-to-end supply chain support, base supply inventories, and predictive analysis and forecasting.  The AF will standardize its business processes within each major logistics functional area through Transformation CI.  Transformation Capability Initiatives (CIs) include, but are not limited to: Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi), Supply Chain Management (SCM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).

Transformation Capability Initiatives

- Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MROi) will create an integrated capability that plans, schedules, and executes organic depot maintenance support functions critical to agile planning, optimized workload assignment, resource allocation and throughput, thereby increasing depot maintenance support to the warfighter. In FY 2018, PE 0708610F, Logistics Information Technology (LOGIT) Air Force, Project 675207, Logistics IT System Modernization, efforts were transferred to PE
0708055F, Maintenance Repair, and Overhaul (MRO), Project 675207, Logistics IT System Modernization, in order to bring greater visibility to the effort since it exceeded yearly funding thresholds and was therefore declared an ACAT I program.

- SCM Item Master provides the capability to manage comprehensive, accurate, reliable item master data (e.g., accurate identification and authorization of owners and users of items).

- SCM Field Maintenance will improve the AF field maintenance capabilities across Mission Generation Network (MGN) and Repair Network (RN) (e.g. propulsion, avionics, C2 enabler systems, cyber systems, communications-electronics &amp; simulation, Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL), etc.) including the planning, scheduling, execution and oversight of functional deficiencies incurred over the past 10 years due to lack of prioritized funding and failure of the previous enterprise-wide modernization approach.

- PLM enables AF engineering/logistics communities to define, track, protect and manage product data for AF weapon systems and equipment.  The AF requires the ability to control configuration of the product throughout the life of the asset.  Standardized configuration control will ensure validity, accuracy, reliability, currency, and security of the product information which will increase weapon system readiness by decreasing costs to manage, protect, store and deliver product information. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver our integrated logistics capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 06065833F.

Budget Activity 7 (BA 7) - This program is in BA 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Office - Business Enterprise Systems (AFPEO-BES) is evaluating systems under the DoDI 5000.75 to approve authorities to proceed (ATP) for each core logistics system remediation/modification project.

The Logistics IT program utilizes the Agile software development methodology in the acquisition of these projects. The projects will use Firm Fixed Price contracts to the maximum extent possible as the program establishes new contracts or task orders. To improve the efficiency of the contracting process and reduce contract cycle time, the core logistics system program offices plan to use the existing NETCENTS-2 contract vehicle utilizing Best Value acquisition methodology where possible. 

Agile development practices transform IT acquisitions by delivering capabilities faster and responding more effectively to changes in operations, technology, and budgets. The four objectives of Agile software development are: 1. Focusing on small, frequent capability releases; 2. Valuing working software over comprehensive documentation; 3. Responding rapidly to changes in operations, technology, and budgets; 4. Actively involving users throughout development to ensure high operational value.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0708611F, project 675042, LIMS-EV Version 3.0 - Business Capability Acquisition Cycle (BCAC) 3, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) implements Business Intelligence (BI) and Decision Support (DS) solutions and includes transitioning to a common Information Technology (IT) hosting environment and development of mobile infrastructure.  The AF must transform its logistics business processes and transition away from using numerous stovepipe systems and process flows that execute the same analysis and decision support tasks.  Eliminating process redundancies across the logistics enterprise will enable the AF to execute more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics in the long term. Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and developing a mobile solution satisfies current and future needs of the enterprise. LIMS-EV funding supports BI and DS development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple authoritative logistics and operational source systems. LIMS-EV funding will extend current BI capabilities to provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of functionality per high priority requirements as defined/approved by the Enterprise Logistics Information Technology (ELIT) authority including support equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities and components (engines, landing gears, fuel, etc.), weapons systems availability and Total Asset Visibility (TAV), and financial, Civil Engineering and Security Forces analytics. Enhances  LIMS-EV functionality per migration from the retiring Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) infrastructure to a an approved Joint Information Environment/Common Computing Environment.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Logistics, Installations and Mission Support - Enterprise View (LIMS-EV) is the A4 Business Intelligence (BI) gateway providing a single, standardized data exploitation capability for reporting analytics across all A4 business areas; provides a single entry point on the Air Force Portal that hosts a variety of BI capabilities in a flexible, dynamic web based environment; supports various reporting and analysis requirements using scorecards, dashboards and predictive analysis ability for strategic, operational, and tactical-level users. It implements BI and Decision Support (DS) solutions; transforms AF/A4 business processes reducing numerous duplicative stovepipe systems/process flows; eliminates process redundancies across the logistics enterprise for more efficient, cost-effective and integrated logistics. LIMS-EV leverages emerging technology to enhance existing capabilities and future enterprise needs; includes transitioning to a common Information Technology IT hosting environment/development of mobile infrastructure. It supports BI and DS development capability used by senior leaders and war fighters to access integrated information from multiple authoritative logistics and operational source systems. Will provide configurable alerting, predictive/what-if analysis, mobile applications and further integration of functionality per high priority requirements as approved by the Enterprise Logistics Information Technology (ELIT) authority for equipment, vehicle, supply, commodities/components, weapons systems, financial, civil engineering and security forces.            
 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver our integrated logistics capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the authoritative data source for recording and managing aircrew training information, aircrew/parachutist management, flying hour tracking, flight pay management, and flying gate tracking for 57,000 Air Force members. The Air Force uses this information to enhance safety of-flight operations and to determine eligibility to perform aviation related events. ARMS interfaces with the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and multiple operations and flight scheduling systems such as Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), Center Operations On-Line(COOL), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS) and is used to determine whom to select for flying operations, assignment actions, and promotion of aircrew members.

New development work is required to provide additional flying operations information which will aid in better portraying Air Force readiness and to feed this data into Defense Readiness Reporting System Strategic (DRRS-S). These enhanced capabilities, to be developed incrementally, include the following: electronic flight record, flying hour management/execution, simulator and RPA management/utilization, full career logbook, training look-back, aircrew member man-month allocation, enhanced resource and jump module management, and additional interfaces.

Development activities started in FY16 for Increment I (Inc I), Build 1, Flight and Flying Hour module which continued in FY17 and is followed by development of Training Data and Simulator Utilization modules in FY18-19.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ARMS capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides grants to the civilian academic community to conduct research on military and civilian equal opportunity issues using standard social science methodology and engineering analysis.  The research methodology and analysis includes developing a literature review proposing hypotheses and methods of research.  The grantee will then gather appropriate data, draw conclusions and present discussions, recommendations and reports based on their funding.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FY17 funding request was reduced by $.269M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding supports Personnel Recovery development efforts to upgrade Isolated Personnel reporting devices &amp; locating systems in support of Combatant Commanders and Services. Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) developmental efforts address Personnel Recovery capability shortfalls &amp; gaps identified in the Personnel Recovery Initial Capabilities Document approved by Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 120-12 on 8 Aug 2012. Activties include funding for research and development, support equipment, contract services and all associated costs specifically identified to support the JPRA headquarters at Ft. Belvoir, VA and other JPRA operating locations.

In FY16, the Common Distress Reporting System (CDRS) began development.  CDRS will integrate all personnel locating devices into the existing reporting device architecture &amp; Combat Survivor Evader Locater base stations to provide one common operating picture for timely and efficient recovery operations of isolated personnel.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element provides for payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.  The Department of Labor (DOL) administers this program and charges the Department of the Air Force for its employee costs; therefore, this is a MUST PAY bill for Air Force.  The Program Element(PE) excludes manpower authorizations and costs. This PE is in Budget Activity 7 in support of payment of civilian compensation benefits for disability due to personal injury sustained while in the performance of duty or due to employment-related disease according to FECA under Title 5 U.S.C., Chapter 81.

This program is in the Budget Activity (BA) 7, Operation System Development because this BA includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services as part of the Data Center Optimization Initiative, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver personnel administration capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F

Program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In CY 2018 Cadet Administration and Information System (CAMIS) was a new start.

The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) is currently in the process of modernizing its Cadet Administration and Information System (CAMIS).  CAMIS is the USAFA's primary mission system and is used for most functions related to the Cadet Lifecycle including class scheduling, grading, summer programs, performance averages, and graduation/commission requirements tracking.  This effort also includes collapsing existing CAMIS IT systems to unique, non-standard processes that remain which include the Cadet Honor System, discipline and accountability, advanced admission, and a replacement for the Cadet Logistics and Supply System (CLASS).  The largest component expected to require development includes re-designing the data warehouse to enable Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) analytic software.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CAMIS will modernize the current Student Information System (SIS) to include Recruiting and Admission, Cadet Life Cycle Management, and Cadet Support Services. The majority of efforts are being completed with 3400 sustainment funding and only the data warehouse re-design is covered by this PE. CAMIS is managed by the United States Air Force Academy. All other aspects of the Acquisition Strategy are still in development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Personnel Services Delivery (PSD), under the Personnel Administration program, funds operational developments necessary to acquire, field, and modify business processes to transform the delivery of Human Resources (HR) capabilities through the structured redesign of the Total Force Personnel Community's people (Active Duty, Reserve, Guard, and Civilians), processes, and technologies. PSD Transformation fundamentally shifts the way personnel services are provided, transitioning from primarily face-to-face interactions with a personnelist to a tiered model with services delivered through online self-service, contact centers, and fewer in-person interactions.  PSD supports the migration of legacy applications and other information technologies to a more sustainable and flexible services-based architecture.  PSD also supports transition from the legacy Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) to the Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) to improve financial auditability and track military personnel data.  To this end, PSD executes the development of several legacy personnel systems through the deployment and transitioning of applications to Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial cloud services as part of the Data Center Optimization Initiative, as well as future HR application requirements which are beyond the scope of AFIPPS.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides for development and enhancement of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for strategic planning, operational requirements, modernization and recapitalization of systems and programs, as well as the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes for the AF Analytic Community and Secretary of the Air Force Standard Analysis Toolkit in support of AF Senior Leadership. As new technologies are introduced to the battlefield (Digital Electronic Jammers, maneuvering Surface-to-Surface Missiles, Directed Energy Weapons, etc.) along with evolving warfighting techniques and support operations, the range of capabilities that needs to be covered by  analytic tools needs to expand as well. M&amp;S creation and enhancement can require extensive research in how to properly implement the emerging weapons capabilities as well as demand development of software techniques to implement the changes. Additionally, emerging and continuing focus areas such as Space, Irregular Warfare, Information Operations, Cyber warfare and ISR demand specific tools of their own for new exploration and development. These focus areas require examination in isolation as well as cross-domain making the problem more complex and increasing the R&amp;D challenges to field new decision support tools.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development as this budget activity includes development efforts to provide new and evolving systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0901538F, project 675178, DEAMS INC 2 Product Development, is a new start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element develops upgrades to existing financial management systems. These upgrades are required to comply with auditability and transparency requirements as well as efficiencies in processing financial transactions. This program element also supports studies and analysis to improve future program planning and execution.

There are four projects within this program element: Program and Budget Enterprise Services (PBES), Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM), Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) Increment 1 (Inc 1), and DEAMS Increment 2 (Inc 2). 

PBES is a software development effort that will utilize a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the Air Force and will replace legacy systems (Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES) and Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS)) that support the budget formulation and force programming process.

CEM is a knowledge-based study effort to improve Air Force-wide cost estimating by analyzing cost data and recommending changes to estimating models, methods, and tools. 

DEAMS is the Air Force's target core accounting and financial management solution, and is a key component of the long-term business process improvements needed to sustain auditability and correct financial system weaknesses.

DEAMS Increment 1 post critical change is focusing on upgrading the software to Oracle Release 12; upgrading the hardware infrastructure; improving reporting capabilities; and deploying to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), US Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and incremental users in Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). 

DEAMS Increment 2 is a new start in FY19 initial business capability and acquisition strategy planning. Planned efforts include incorporating Increment 1 deferred acquisition capabilities to AFSPC and AFMC.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver financial management information systems capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>PBES is a single solution software development effort to deliver budgeting and programming capability for the United States Air Force. PBES will replace legacy systems such as the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment System (ABIDES), Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS) and the Enhanced Tradespace Tool (ETT), supporting the budget formulation and force programming process. Upon full deployment of PBES, the system will be compliant with the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS) and Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA) conventions, which will enable standardization of data across the Department of Defense (DoD).

Utilizing Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), the Air Force has designated PBES as the solution to deliver traceability of financial data in support of the programming and budgeting processes. Through the use of BPR, PBES will address excessive overhead, outdated business practices and other time-consuming support activities. PBES will make the budget formulation process more efficient by incorporating business best practices, organizing programming and budgeting personnel, as well as utilizing current technology. PBES will also eliminate checks and balances required of older technology, taking advantage of automated reconciliation services. In addition, the solution will allow the use of Authoritative Data Sources (ADS) for data exposure, resulting in more timely and accurate budget submissions to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Congress, and other internal and external customers.

A Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product has been selected as the tool of choice which will require minor configuration changes to meet the stated user requirements.  There are not any planned code changes to the actual COTS product itself which should drive lower support costs along with making future requirements changes easier in the out-years.  Requirements will be satisfied through an iterative process of sprint development cycles, where usable capability is produced and made available to operational users after every sprint. The IPO construct along with application of agile principles allows the program to properly plan system requirements, deliver early capability to the end users, achieve early return on investment of taxpayer dollars, division of risk, reduce waste, effectively respond to change, and continuously improve our processes.

Through agile software development, PBES will look to introduce capability quickly to the field by sitting with requirements owners and incorporating their feedback into the application in real-time. Efforts are already underway to incorporate these changes and are currently being rolled out in 5 week delivery cycles. This rhythm has already proved successful in delivering 5 Sprints on-time with added functionality to the users.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cost Estimating Modeling (CEM) provides and enhances Air Force-wide cost estimating capabilities by developing current cost data and estimating methods and tools, data process reengineering, data structure development, and gap filling initiatives.  In collaboration with the OSD Cost Assessment Data Enterprise (CADE) project (DoD's unified initiative to collect, organize, store, and use data more efficiently), these products will improve the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of the acquisition program cost estimates required by statute (e.g., 10 USC 2366, 2433, 2434) and regulation (e.g., DoDI 5000.02) in support of AF and DoD acquisition decisions, programming and execution decisions, and Congressional mandates.   

CEM will ensure the Air Force continuously improves cost estimating capabilities for broad cross-cutting areas, as well as specific to each weapon system type (aircraft, UAVs, ballistic missiles, tactical missiles, munitions, electronics and aircraft modifications, ground stations and automated information systems, space and launch vehicles).  Changing technologies, acquisition laws, regulations, and initiatives drive the need to revise cost estimating processes, methods, and tools.  For example, current capability shortfalls reflect gaps in the ability to respond effectively to the laws and regulations such as the FY06 NDAA report (PL 109-163--Provisions relating to Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)), Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) (provisions related to improving cost estimating quality, especially earlier in the program life-cycle and affordability analysis), Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) Acquisition Excellence Plan (priorities to improve cost estimating capability and affordability analysis and improved cost estimating support to requirements process), and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy (better buying power initiatives on enhanced trade-off analysis, affordability analysis, and will versus should cost analysis).  The CADE and CEM partnership is the lead example for AT&amp;L Better Data initiatives designed as a response to Congressional expressed desire for better outcomes in acquisition.  The partnership provides data/analysis/methods/tools and institutional knowledge at the analysts' fingertips versus the status quo inefficient, ad hoc approach.

This project will perform knowledge-based studies (KBS) to include analyzing historical data and changing technologies/programmatics to develop new estimating methods (e.g. statistical tools, cost estimating relationships (CERs)) across hundreds of product work breakdown structure (WBS) elements and functional cost elements within each weapon system type noted above.  Examples of areas of cost studies and modeling efforts that cut across all weapon system types are cost risk analysis metrics; model/tool development; software cost data sets and metrics; contract or engineering change order studies, analysis, and models; other government cost databases, methods, and analysis tools (e.g., depot standup and government test); nuclear hardening technology change and impacts to cost; cybersecurity emerging issues and costs; time phasing method improvements; reliability and maintainability trends and impacts on cost; and overarching and commodity area price escalation analysis and estimating method development.

CEM will deliver valuable analytical tools in support of higher quality/credible estimates (as required by statute and regulation) allowing for more realistic cost conscious decisions on over $100B of critical warfighter capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0901538F, project 675178, DEAMS INC 2 Product Development, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. The DEAMS implementation will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). DEAMS is a key enabler and provides the core accounting system for all enterprise business system development necessary to sustain financial statement auditability.  

DEAMS Inc 2 provides specific capabilities necessary to provide the core accounting and reporting functionality necessary to enable development and deployment of modernized personnel, contracting and logistics systems.  Additional capabilities under requirements definition include complex acquisition management, reimbursable cost accounting, military entitlement accounting, advanced accounting controls and audit sustainment, treasury cash accountability, and management accounting and billing for revolving funds.   Included in these capabilities are selected requirements deferred from Increment 1.  

Additional user deployments enabled by future increment capabilities include acquisition program executive offices; ranges, laboratories and test centers; and air logistics centers.  

This funding request will support development of initial Capability Implementation Plan (CIP), Capability Process Maps (CPMs) for each business capability, and mapping of financial management processes the capability will require (Blueprinting). Additionally, the funding will support acquisition strategy planning by early identification/definition of IT Functional Requirements (ITFRs) and Information Assets (IA), Acquisition Strategy Determination, Solution Approach, and Request for Proposal (RFP) preparation. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), Oracle-based software implementation effort that will provide an auditable, modern accounting and finance system. DEAMS is a Joint United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program that will replace many existing accounting and finance legacy systems and will provide core funds execution management functions consistent with financial management laws, regulations and policy, general ledger, funds management, payments, receivables, cost and revenues, and fiduciary reporting. DEAMS is compliant with the Clinger-Cohen Act, Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), and integrates into Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF). When fully deployed, DEAMS will be key to Air Force compliance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) requirement in the 2010 NDAA.

DEAMS user deployments include:
- Air Mobility Command (AMC) without Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
- AMC with TWCF, in conjunction with Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Rome
- Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
- Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) and other Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) to include DFAS Limestone, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and DFAS Japan
- U. S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), DFAS Europe, and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Joint Base San Antonio
- Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) (Incremental Deployments)
- Remaining DFAS locations and all other GSUs
 
On 23 January 2017, the senior official provided the Critical Change Report (CCR) with certifications to Congress. The report recommended a restructure of DEAMS from one increment to multiple increment.  The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the restructured program for DEAMS Inc 1, to include deferring certain requirements to future increments, a limited deployment to an additional 700 users for Inc 1 to United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE), and the updated Full Deployment Decision (FDD) criteria via an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 2 June 2017.  FDD Threshold date is August 2020 and Full Deployment (FD) Threshold date is February 2021.

The remaining DEAMS Inc 1 schedule includes Oracle R12 upgrade transition to a new production environment, hardware upgrade, and reporting and disbursing initiatives, where applicable via software releases to the system baseline. 

DEAMS funding includes initial planning, design, and development activities associated with the DEAMS Inc 2 effort.

DEAMS Inc 1 is developing capability which allows for deployment to the remaining user locations.  However, DEAMS has also begun transitioning the support of previously deployed locations to the Operation and Support (O&amp;S) phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The USSTRATCOM Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection program (DCIP) is a risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to USSTRATCOM and other DoD missions.  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense &amp; Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&amp;ASA)].  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect defense critical infrastructure.

Navigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations. The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of Navwar knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with the Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition. Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. JNWC-conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating US and Coalition Navwar capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments. JNWC provides Department wide PNT posture through the PNT Annual assessment. JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on two Joint Mission Essential Tasks:

1. Provide Operational Navwar Support - Enable Navwar operations and provide planning subject matter expertise to Combatant Commands, Services, interagency partners
and the coalition; Advocate DoD-wide Navwar activities to fully integrate Navwar into military operations and the future force structure.

2. Create and Maintain Navwar Knowledge Operationalize PNT Superiority - Conduct PNT operational field assessments, studies and analyses, analyze and disseminate Navwar R intelligence, and maintain a Navwar armory 

The Space Analysis and Application Development program integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats. This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) campaign level M&amp;S tool. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions. The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. 

USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. These data isolation challenges result from network isolation, incomplete communications architectures, data security, incompatible information formats, security release policy, etc., inhibiting effective and efficient consolidation of decision quality strategic, operational and tactical information. The DIFC develops machine to machine solutions capable of ingesting Title 10 data at multiple classification levels, to include Special Access Program data, and associating/correlating with National Technical Means at multiple classification levels to both enhance and amplify the Common Operational Picture. The DIFC works closely with DoD SAPCO and elements of the Director of National Intelligence, to include NSA, NRO and CIA, to both identify and address policy barriers, architectures and training opportunities necessary to enable seamless flow of data from all available sensors to warfighters during time of conflict, primarily leveraging currently fielded tactical data links. Though some recommended solutions validated during demonstration events may not transition to operations immediately, but nevertheless provide validated architecture solutions and approved security policies for use should conflict arise versus ad hoc attempts to solve data movement issues during conflict.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

THIS IS NOT A NEW START.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The USSTRATCOM Defense Critical Infrastructure Protection program (DCIP) is a risk management program that seeks to ensure the availability of networked assets critical to USSTRATCOM and other DoD missions.  Critical infrastructure assets can include installations, facilities, antennas, vehicles, computing systems, and communications links. DCIP is directed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland Defense &amp; Americas' Security Affairs) [OASD (HD&amp;ASA)].  DCIP manages the identification, prioritization, assessment, and assurance of Critical Infrastructure as a comprehensive program that includes the development of adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk, restore capability in the event of loss or degradation, support incident management, and protect defense critical infrastructure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navigation Warfare (Navwar) is deliberate defensive and offensive action to assure positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) information through coordinated employment of space, cyberspace, and electronic warfare (EW) operations.  The JNWC develops and maintains the Department's premier collection of NAVWAR knowledge, and provides subject matter expertise support to the warfighters, Department decision makers, the Federal Interagency (the Department of Homeland Security and other civil agencies concerned with Critical National Infrastructure), and the Coalition.   Navwar expertise is developed in part by execution of PNT Operational Field Assessments (POFAs), modeling and simulation, analysis, and exercise and training support. JNWC conducted POFAs are a key element in evaluating US and Coalition NAVWAR capabilities and vulnerabilities and adversary capabilities and vulnerabilities, both crucial to executing PNT superiority mission sets in potentially denied / degraded PNT environments.  JNWC provides Department wide PNT posture through the PNT annual assessment. JNWC helps develop defensive and offensive PNT capabilities by focusing on two Joint Mission Essential Tasks:  

1. Provide Operational Navwar Support - Enable Navwar operations and provide planning subject matter expertise to Combatant Commands, Services, interagency partners and the coalition; Advocate DoD-wide Navwar activities to fully integrate Navwar into military operations and the future force structure. 

2. Create and Maintain Navwar Knowledge Operationalize PNT Superiority - Conduct PNT operational field assessments, studies and analyses, analyze and disseminate Navwar R intelligence, and maintain a Navwar armory.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>Joint Navigation Warfare Center (JNWC) conducts PRISM, FORTUNE, and GYPSY operational field assessments on an on-going, annual basis.

PRISM events encompass all Operations, Actions, and Activities (OAAs) associated with events outside of specific Combatant Command and/or Service exercise or mission event.  

FORTUNE events are Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) vulnerability field assessments and are small scale technical risk assessments or can be risk reduction events for larger GYPSY events.

GYPSY events are larger than FORTUNE PNT related events and involve other coalition partners, and multiple US services in direct support of Geographic Combatant Command requirements. 

JNWC uses the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) program, administered by USD (AT&amp;L). Requirements dictate which MRTFB facility will be contracted to host a GYPSY or FORTUNE event.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Analysis and Application Development program Integrates space based effects into Department's ‘Model of Record' for joint campaign analysis. Current modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) models are inadequate to represent the contribution that U.S space capabilities make to the air, sea, and land fight and do not accurately portray current and future space threats.  This line of effort integrates effects of space capabilities into the Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) and other mission and campaign-level M&amp;S tools. Enhanced space M&amp;S will enable the DoD to make informed decisions regarding the direction of U.S. Space Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures, and Resource Decisions.  

The DoD requires the ability to conduct campaign-level analysis to quantify the holistic operational impacts of adversary space actions on military campaigns and U.S. global operations. 

USSTRATCOM Data Integration and Fusion Center (DIFC) is an innovative organization developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to overcome data isolation in order to enable kill chains in the Joint Battlespace. Funds are necessary to update current government-owned software to ingest and disseminate new data sources from Title 10 and Title 50 sensors.  The DIFC efforts at COCOM sponsored experimentation events will inform service acquisition decisions, capability gaps, intelligence gaps and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and implementation to mitigate effects on warfighter operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations. Projects are designed to transition to warfighters and/or national intelligence agencies for operational use, sustainment and appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for further development. AF TENCAP projects can influence the design and operation of current and future air, space,
cyber, national and global ISR and NTISR while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations and units.

Program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs). Projects are executed to provide continued support to the National Warfighter, operational and Tactical Warfighter, and to Special Operations Forces.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF TENCAP capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via Air Force TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements. The U.S. government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by Air Force TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program team to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The FAB-T program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC).  FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. The Air Force will continue development of the FAB-T Command Post Terminal (CPT), performing systems engineering, architecture studies, development &amp; operational test efforts, FAB-T terminal interoperability with the full AEHF satellite constellation activities, and other program activities to meet current and future emerging SATCOM requirements. 

The Force Element Terminal (FET) subprogram provides a nuclear survivable terminal capable of communicating with the Milstar and AEHF satellites, and provides for survivable NC3 data transport services (EAM dissemination and force report back) for airborne platforms. The FET is for the B-52 and select RC-135 aircraft and will not provide satellite control or PNVC functionality. 

The PNVC capability is a critical element of the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) System.  PNVC is the Survivable Emergency Conferencing Network (SECN) replacement capability which provides anti-jam, anti-scintillation, survivable, and endurable voice communications through the AEHF satellite system for national and strategic users.  There are several components being developed and procured by other organizations that must be synchronized to expeditiously field this capability. The PNVC Integrator is responsible for end-to-end integration of these components, to include requirements traceability, end-to-end system testing, configuration and checkout activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identification of deficiencies in overall PNVC system capability, enterprise and life cycle support for PNVC components. The AFPEO/SP approved entry into the acquisition lifecycle as a post MS-A ACAT III Program of Record in January 2016. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver FAB-T weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>FAB-T Acquisition Strategy:  In FY 2012, the government restructured the FAB-T development program to introduce competition into the acquisition strategy in order to reduce risk in delivering this capability as well as to drive down production costs. To ensure the best value to the government, the Air Force awarded production contracts in September 2013 to both contractors (Boeing and Raytheon). The production contracts began with production planning for both contractors. In June 2014, the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon. Development and production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals continued with Raytheon. The first Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015.

PNVC Acquisition Strategy: On May 15, 2015 the Deputy Secretary of Defense assigned the PNVC End-to-End Integration responsibility to the Air Force; effective May 16, 2015, SAF/AQ designated the AFPEO/SP.   The PNVC End-to-End Integrator program is responsible for requirements traceability, End-to-End system testing, site configuration activities, training and technical manuals, network transition support, identifying deficiencies in the PNVC capability, and enterprise and life cycle support for all PNVC components.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 1203110F, project 673276, Resilient Enterprise Ground, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas are distributed around the globe at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS) and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Missile Warning, Communications, Weather, Launch Vehicle Support, and Research and Development (R&amp;D) in support of Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY 2017 the AFSCN supported 14 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of $4.97B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry as the rocket travels through the atmosphere and transmit commands to a newly orbiting satellite to initiate early orbit checkout. In FY 2017, the AFSCN supported 26 launches delivering $14.2B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and rockets can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to develop next-generation tools to improve the AFSCN and ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence Community, and civil users. These efforts support cybersecurity operations and Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) activities as well as align with the evolving future space domain demands through Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG) &amp; Enterprise Ground Services (EGS), to include transmit and receive, data transport, and cyber activities.

Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC) - Satellite Anomaly Recovery and Support Upgrade; Enhanced High-Power Amplifier (EHPA): The Air Force will complete development testing of the EHPA first article. The AFSCN is in jeopardy of losing the emergency high power satellite contact capability due to obsolete parts used in the legacy AFSCN system. The EHPA program will develop a new high power amplifier that resolves the obsolescence issue through the 2020s.

AFSCN Deficiency Resolution: Provides test, cyber security, requirements management, and system architecture support to the AFSCN.  

Electronic Scheduling and Dissemination (ESD): The ESD project called AFSCN Scheduling Tool (AST) will allow satellite operators to request contact time with their satellites via the shared AFSCN antennas, automatically deconflict overlapping requests, create a schedule, and publish the schedule in real-time to all users.

Resilient Enterprise Ground (REG): Provides the means to communicate with all future spacecraft through diverse antenna networks. This effort is a New Start in FY2019.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFSCN weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  BA 7 includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites. The program develops, acquires, and operates satellite command and control (C2) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for the design, development, integration, testing, sustainment and operations of the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 systems installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and Schriever AFB, CO. 

The main objective of the MMSOC Development is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space domain. 

This Program Element contains the EGS as part of the evolving current and future space domain. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS C2 product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and resiliency in space program ground systems. The RDSMO program will continue to support all mission sets described above as the EGS capability becomes the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users. The main objective of the EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. In FY 2019, EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver warfighting space capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Research and Development Space and Missile Operations (RDSMO) program, executed by the Advanced Systems and Development Directorate at Kirtland AFB, NM, conducts space and missile Research and Developmental Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in support of experimental, demonstration, and operational satellites. The program develops, acquires, and operates satellite command and control (C2) and fixed/deployable telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) antenna systems in support of AF and DoD missions. The RDSMO program is responsible for the design, development, integration, testing, sustainment and operations of the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) C2 systems installed in the RDT&amp;E Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM and Schriever AFB, CO.

The main objective of the MMSOC Development is to develop the capability to rapidly support R&amp;D and operational systems and to transition R&amp;D space vehicle technology with residual military utility to operational status for immediate warfighter support. MMSOC is a multiple mission operation system that uses standard software to (1) perform satellite C2 in support of launch requirements; (2) develop and test tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts to conduct satellite operations; (3) provide a satellite C2 incremental block evolution resource for RDT&amp;E of new systems and concepts; and (4) deliver operational flexibility for new and currently flying assigned satellites. A secondary objective of MMSOC is to provide a foundational C2 platform and product line for the Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) effort to build upon and to meet the evolving initiatives of the current and future space domain. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) program is part of the evolving current and future space domain demands. MMSOC capability will transition to become the EGS command and control (C2) product line. The EGS C2 product line will perform technology maturation, experiments, prototyping and operational mission transition for increased commonality and  resiliency in space program ground systems. The EGS capability will become the primary ground C2 system for AFSPC and other users.

The main objective of the EGS is to provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for Air Force space systems. In FY 2019, EGS will focus efforts on developing and integrating data centers in laboratories at three separate sites, advanced concept exploration, prototype development and demonstrations, user experience maturation, training and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) refinement, cyber operations and operational mission training support. These efforts will require support such as systems engineering, integration and test, standards and interface development, architecture development, enhanced cybersecurity development and implementation.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) provides the Air Force with a robust enterprise ground architecture by creating a set of government standards and interfaces to flexibly manage and execute integrated and agile satellite operations (SATOPS) in a contested environment. EGS provides the complete operations solution for SATOPS at various classification levels with increased resiliency and capability, and improved cyber defense capabilities. EGS will enable a near-real-time common operating picture of enterprise-wide tactical health, status and indications, and warnings for Air Force satellites. The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber- secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes. EGS operates as a key element of the current and future space domain, and leverages lessons learned, contracts and resources from the other elements of the Enterprise Space Battle Management Command and Control (ESBMC2) and Threat Warning and Response (TWAR).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Located at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the Space Innovation, Integration and Rapid Technology Development program develops and modifies modeling and simulation tools that Air Force Space Command's Space Analysis Center uses for operations research, military utility analyses, tradeoff studies, and other evaluations of space mission areas to guide planning, programming, requirements generation, analyses of alternatives, and other activities.  Development activities incorporate changes in fielded and projected space operational capabilities, as well as technical improvements, into the group's software tools to ensure their data and technology remain current. Space Training Simulators develop and upgrades space training emulators using Standard Space Trainer (SST) to meet Space Mission Force (SMF) threat-based, advanced training requirements as well as funds connection to Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) training networks. Finally, its innovation, education, and training activities foster solutions to operational deficiencies and enhance the integration of space systems into Air Force operations, thereby enabling service and joint warfighters to realize the full potential of existing and planned space capabilities.  

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The IBS fulfills the warfighter's requirements for worldwide threat warning and situational awareness information with timely production and simultaneous dissemination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) derived combat information. It also provides target tracking data to support threat avoidance, targeting, force protection, and situational awareness. This information is continually refined in near real time by strategic, operational and tactical sensors.

IBS is comprised of the following:
- A Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) on UHF (Ultra High Frequency) satellite channel using a Common Message Format (CMF) and a Military Standard (MIL-STD) Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) compliant waveform and Line of Sight (LOS) using the Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT). 
- IBS-Network Services (IBS-NS) includes two Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and four Theater Interface Nodes (TINs) to support the geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), all built to validated warfighter requirements.
-- Two GINS receive data from each theater and integrate this data into a worldwide picture available to all network/broadcast users. 
-- Four regional TINs allow local and out-of-theater users (not directly receiving IBS broadcast) to receive the CIB information broadcast.  Additionally, the TIN will receive and inject data into the CIB for producers without access to the theater CIB. 

This PE funds:
- Development/upgrades of IBS (IBS-NS, CIB, and CMF) 

This project will identify and implement an open, scalable system architecture that will accommodate growth as the virtual world grows and cyber operations change.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IBS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space.  LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests.  LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely; together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation.  The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).

LTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data.  The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g. radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation.

As aging range systems exhibit decreasing reliability, leading to higher operations and maintenance costs and increasing the risk of launch delays, the Air Force requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct architecture analyses to optimize investment planning for safety of flight (such as the use of drones, high definition optics, phased-array radars etc.) and commercial launch.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver LTRS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program activity is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production fielding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Due to the fielded LTRS age and obsolescence issues, many systems need to be replaced (e.g. communications systems at ER &amp; WR). These major modifications will be competed, typically among small business contractors, and selected through best value source selections. The competitively-selected SE&amp;I contractor manages government-controlled requirements and processes as well as provide support to the "government as the integrator" between LTRS Integrated Support Contract (LISC) and separately competed modernization projects. FFRDC provides mission assurance oversight to ensure capabilities meet operational need.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2019, Program Element (PE) 1203265F, GPS III Space Segment, Project 67A019, GPS III funding for GPS IIIC Follow-On efforts were transferred to PE 1203269F, Project 653170, GPS IIIC due to the establishment of a new PE for GPS III Follow-on SVs 11+ to provide MDAP transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operations of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under PE 1203164F), Space (funded under this PE, 1203165F, and PE 1203269F) and a Control Network (funded under PE 1203165F and PE 1206423F). The satellites broadcast high accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support; Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in PE 1203265F and PE 1203269F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of GPS III SVs 01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This PE includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  

Starting in FY2019 PE 1203269F will fund the RDT&amp;E of GPS III Follow-On SVs 11 and 12 which will include Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) support efforts. This production design activity includes risk-reducing simulators and systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On SVs, including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking and Control (TT&amp;C), integration of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hosted payloads, a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal, and Regional Military Protection (RMP) which provides the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base supply.  The Air Force (AF) is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding and PE 1203265F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet the congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchases to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with OCX, supports Military Global Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
- Compliance with Commander, Air Force Space Command mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.
- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.
- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded with this budget item will determine whether or not an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Space Segment weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SV 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On Production Readiness effort.

This program is a Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full-rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Search and Rescue GPS (SAR/GPS) is an approved auxiliary payload on GPS III beginning no earlier than SV 11. SAR/GPS fills validated National Search and Rescue (SAR) Committee requirements to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for SAR.

In addition, the United States Air Force (USAF) has on-going requirements to rescue US Military personnel in harm's way per AF Doctrine Document 2-1.6. The implementation of a U.S. Medium Earth Orbiting (MEO) SAR Space Segment is via a Canadian-provided 406 MHz SAR repeater on GPS III SVs. This system presents a cost effective, low-risk opportunity that accommodates existing and planned 406 MHz beacons across the globe. Per National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-39, USAF and United States Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S. operators of the civil Cosmicheskaya Sistyema Poiska Avariynich Sudov-Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (COSPAS/SARSAT) system, and the international SAR system will integrate the Canadian provided SAR repeater into GPS III beginning no earlier than SV 11.

SAR/GPS funds are transferred to GPS III SPAF beginning in FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Analysis and Application Development Military Code (M-Code) Hosted Payload will provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses funded in this project will determine whether an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance and resiliency through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation. This augmentation to the GPS constellation enables future rapid technology on-ramps with minimal risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The initial studies, prototyping and experiments will explore size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) requirements of potential payloads, the level of broadcast power as received on the ground, advanced signal capabilities, the needed modifications that will allow current and future GPS ground control systems to communicate with these payloads, and how best to upgrade GPS user equipment with minimal impact on cost and downtime to existing GPS users. The current program under investigation has both a challenging SWAP-C requirement and launch schedule, requiring immediate action by the U.S. if it is to deliver a payload in time for integration into host vehicles.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GPS III is the next generation Space Vehicle (SV) supporting the GPS constellation and is funded in Program Element (PE) 1203265F. GPS III SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new international civil (L1C) signal, enhanced anti-jam power, and a growth path to full warfighter capabilities. GPS III SVs 03-10 are in the Production &amp; Deployment Phase.

PE 1203265F funds GPS III and supports Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of GPS III SVs 01-02, and risk-reducing simulators through a systems engineering approach that matures and delivers SVs for launch. This program includes SVs 01-02 engineering studies and analyses, trade studies, system development, test and evaluation efforts, integrated logistics support products, on-orbit support, and mission operations support for civil and military applications that protect U.S. military and allied use of GPS. The program also includes Contingency Operations (COps) as a bridge capability to fly GPS III SVs until the delivery of the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  

Mission Readiness Campaign (MRC) activities include launch preparation, planning, mission readiness testing to validate space-ground-user interfaces, mission crew exercises and rehearsals, launch vehicle integration, and On-Orbit Checkout activities to validate performance prior to launch. Newly certified launch vehicles must be incorporated into the GPS III launch baseline. Integration requires the development of plans and procedures, and procurement of special support equipment.

Space Modernization Initiative (SMI) focuses on space vehicle affordability and capability, addresses future requirements and resiliency needs, and expands the industrial base to enhance future competition. Phase 1 will address a GPS Enterprise Analysis of Alternative (AoA) recommendations to increase GPS signal strength from space by maturing navigation payload technologies that include a new regional Military Code (M-Code) capability. The Air Force (AF) is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with AFRL's Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding, PE 1203265F, and starting in FY2019 PE 1203269F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads.

GPS supports the early deployment of Global M-Code to meet a congressional mandate limiting user equipment purchase to M-Code capable receivers starting in FY2017. The funds will cover the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program and support development costs associated with the GPS control segment software to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter, as well as the ability to command and control, process, and monitor the M-Code signal. MCEU mitigates delays with GPS OCX, supports Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) testing, and allows for early M-Code operations. M-Code provides greater security to protect navigation and timing in electronically contested environments.

Impacts of the M-Code deployment include:
- Compliance with Commander, Air Force Space Command mandate to provide global monitoring necessary for Early M-Code Operational Use and verification of Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effects.
- Direction to improve the resiliency of the GPS capability.
- Confirmation that Enterprise modernization efforts are integrated and deployed properly.
- Testing and Verification of M-Code capability on MGUE/GPS III solution and early M-Code use tied to MGUE fielding

The feasibility studies and preliminary engineering analyses that are funded by this budget item will determine whether or not an initiative to host GPS M-Code augmentation payloads on other satellite systems is practical and beneficial. The primary goal is to provide additional mission assurance through redundant systems not directly connected with the current U.S. GPS satellite constellation.

This PE encompasses the GPS III (SVs 01-10), COps, MCEU, M-Code Hosted Payload, and prior to FY2019, GPS III Follow-On Production Readiness effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enterprise Ground Services (EGS) will provide a robust enterprise ground architecture for AF space systems, which leverages mission commonality and automation to reduce sustainment costs and re-focus manpower on warfighting capabilities. In addition, EGS will enable a near-real-time common operating picture of enterprise-wide tactical health, status, indications, and warnings for AF satellites. The end-state will be a modern technical infrastructure which is cyber-
secure and resilient against the Advanced Persistent Threat and employs streamlined architecting, acquisition, and operational processes. Through early architecture studies and prototyping, the government will establish clear ownership of the technical baseline to meet Better Buying Power principles as the EGS effort evolves through development. This effort provides focus and expertise for the development, test, certification and enforcement of standards and interfaces for all Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) satellite ground systems to enable transition planning for legacy ground systems, new capability demonstrations, and systems acquisition leading to an enterprise ground architecture for AF space systems.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The GPS III next generation space segment (SV01-10) rapidly and affordably responds to warfighter capability requirements. The acquisition approach utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach which focuses on mitigating cost and schedule risk through a lower risk incremental delivery of mature technologies. This approach focuses on mission success and on time delivery. The GPS III SVs will have GPS IIF capabilities plus up to a 3x-8x increase in anti-jam signal power, 3x improved accuracy, 3+ year increased design life, a new civil (L1C) signal compatible with the European Galileo system and a satellite bus capable of supporting future SV capability additions.

The AF is starting a new program for the second phase of the two-phased GPS III Follow-On production acquisition strategy for SVs 11-32 with SAF/AQ as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment provided data and insight into contractors' GPS III production designs with emphasis on a mature navigation payload and production-ready designs. Phase 1 results affirmed the viability of a competitive approach for Phase 2. The Phase 2 strategy transfers funding to PE 1203269F to conduct a full-and-open competition for 22 GPS III Follow-On SVs and specifies the use of RDT&amp;E funds to deliver SVs 11 and 12, and conduct associated Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE). Upon Milestone C approval, the AF will procure SVs 13-32 via annual contract options exercised using Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF) funds consistent with full-funding policy under an annual buy approach. In addition to SVs 11 and 12, the RDT&amp;E effort will be comprised of developing risk reducing simulators, support test equipment, and conducting the systems engineering associated with delivering the new capabilities required of GPS III Follow-On SVs 11-32 including backward compatibility, dual band Telemetry, Tracking and Control (TT&amp;C), integration of GFE hosted payloads including a redesigned NDS payload, SAR/GPS payload, LRA, and RMP, which provides the ability to deliver high-power regional M-Code signals in specific areas of intended effect.  RDT&amp;E funding for SVs 11 and 12 will be in PE 1203269F, Project GPS III Follow-On.  SPAF funding for SVs 13-32 will be in PE 1203269F, Project GPS III Follow-On beginning in FY2020.

The AF is using its research laboratories to mature an On-Orbit Reprogrammable Digital Waveform Generator (ORDWG) which will provide signal flexibility to change the signal form while the satellite is on-orbit. This effort will be funded with AFRL's S&amp;T funding, PE 1203265F, and starting in FY2019 PE 1203269F to increase the number of alternate navigation payloads and inform future PNT architectures.

On 19 July 2016 the Program Executive Officer (PEO) Space, approved the Acquisition Strategy Document (ASD) for the Contingency Operations (COps) effort. The strategy utilizes contingency constellation sustainment capability for GPS III Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). GPS III COps is needed because GPS OCX will not deliver in time to support initial GPS III SV operations. COps operates (post-launch and check-out) GPS III SVs at the capability level of GPS IIR-M or GPS IIF using the existing Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) control segment.

On 21 Jan 2017, the PEO Space, approved the ASD for the M-Code Early Use (MCEU) program. The MCEU acquisition strategy, when executed, will enable the GPS Enterprise to provide core M-Code capabilities to the warfighter prior to GPS OCX delivery. MCEU will also support the scheduled operational testing of MGUE. MCEU will update the GPS control segment software, AEP, to allow for command and control, processing, and integrity monitoring of the M-Code signal. MCEU will acquire this capability by using the existing GPS III prime contract vehicle to modify the operational AEP software.

HQ USAF/A5R approved reinstatement of a previously deferred Key Support Area (KSA) on 10 Feb 2016. The MSTIC receivers currently under development will get a software upgrade to process M-Code data. This $7.96M project to procure the M-MSTIC receivers is being funded through 3400/SPAF funds in FY2016-FY2018. Performance monitoring, integration and test will be conducted by the MCEU program and sustained under the GPL Lockheed Martin Contract. Funding is sent through a Form-9 from DoD to Lockheed Martin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides Electronic Support (ES) for key find, fix, track, target, engage and assess (F2T2EA) requirements supporting Space Superiority activities.  Funds developmental intelligence collection to support new capability acquisition and development.  This project also funds transportable intelligence collection and analysis capabilities that are modular (plug-and-play), and can keep pace with technological advances and emerging threats.  It provides intelligence support systems for Space Situational Awareness activities that provide the requisite current and predictive knowledge of space events and threat conditions and intelligence support to Space Protection Programs by providing architectural survivability analysis of critical mission assets for mission assurance.  It also supports phased threat system analysis and studies (A&amp;S), test support, lab equipment, and Material Acquisition and Exploitation (MAE) for system development and vulnerability/susceptibility assessments to support tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development and future threat technology studies necessary for mission area success and achievement of space superiority, and to preserve the US space advantage across all domains.   

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) Program is a Space Command and Control (C2) capability for the Commander, Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC SPACE). The JMS program is predominately a software effort that will produce an integrated, net-centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the necessary software applications to accomplish required missions. The program will provide a collaborative environment that will enhance and modernize space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities; create decision-relevant views of the space environment; rapidly detect, track and characterize objects of interest; identify / exploit traditional and non-traditional sources; perform space threat analysis; and enable efficient distribution of data across the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). Furthermore, it provides a viable migration path from the legacy Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) system, which has 75% of its components beyond end of life or end of service, and the majority of its software is no longer vendor-supported. Enterprise Space BMC2 (previously JMS Increment 3) will provide a Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) system which will allow the Commander, JFCC-Space to command and control space forces in the space control and space situational awareness realms. This system will develop and integrate battle management mission applications, create an interactive modeling and simulation environment to support training and exercises, provide for secure data sharing and workflow, and Course of Action (COA) development. Funding includes technical studies, development, experimentation, integration and related support costs.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JMS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

The FY2019 funding request was reduced by $29.800 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Prior year funding for the National Space Defense Center was in PE 1203940F, Space Situational Awareness Operations, Project 670004, Other STRATCOM Activities

In FY2019, PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center, Project 67A035, Enterprise Space BMC2 efforts were transferred to PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center, Project 670004, Other STRATCOM activities to provide program transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element will develop Battle Management and Command and Control (BMC2) applications for the National Space Defense Center (NSDC) (formerly Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC)).  In addition, this element will develop hardware and software prototypes to support US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006) for an Accelerated BMC2 capability.  The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrades systems and transition them to operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element will develop Battle Management and Command and Control (BMC2) applications for the National Space Defense Center (NSDC) (formerly Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC)). In addition, this element will develop hardware and software prototypes to support US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006) for an Accelerated BMC2 capability. The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, this element will develop hardware and software prototypes to support US Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need (ST-0006) for an Accelerated BMC2 capability.  The NSDC allows the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events and will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Shared Early Warning System (SEWS) is the result of Presidential foreign policy initiatives which began in 1996. The SEWS continues to provide Theater Combatant Commanders and foreign nation customers direct operational benefit by improving the architectural design and equipment thereby providing enhanced mission capabilities (i.e., expanded coverage, emerging capability integration, etc.). Foreign customer arrangements are negotiated with individual countries on a bilateral basis to provide selected region-specific missile warning information. SEWS Integration and Test facility is kept current by enhancing systems to improve analysis of real world events.  To enhance mission capability the SEWS program tests message format updates, cross domain solution updates, mandatory crypto upgrades, SEWS integration with other warning systems, and the transition to "coalition-based" warning.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

The North Warning System (NWS) is composed of 1970s era radar systems. The existing radar technology is quickly approaching obsolescence with regards to future threats.

In FY 2018, PE 0308699F, Shared Early Warning (SEW) efforts were transferred to PE 1203699F, Shared Early Warning (SEW) due to the creation of a new Major Force Program for Space. FY 2017 funding is now documented in the exhibits for PE 1203699F.

In FY 2019, no funding is requested and no funding is required as all SEWS development will be complete.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy is to build on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to modernize and sustain SEWS.  The program office serves as the SEW system integrator, relying on a Prime Contractor for Logistics, Operations, and Sustainment support.  This contract was re-competed through full and open competition in 2017 and was awarded to a small business.  The current contract has a Period of Performance (PoP) through 30 Sep 2018.  Additionally, some SEWS requirements are satisfied through Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests to external programs of record.

The analysis of alternatives for potential replacement of the NWS will be accomplished using a to be determined mix of organic, federally funded research and development center, and advisory and assistance support contractor efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the earth's atmosphere or in near space. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM), and a classified mission.

The USNDS program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the  Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF's USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&amp;T) activities on Space Vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the development of the USNDS ground segment (described below).

DoD funds their contribution to the Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) program in Program Element (PE) 1203913F with Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF), and operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M).

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) platforms (classified GEO host). Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS. Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment, the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), and the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS), the five deployable mobile ground segment survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded. The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State (DOS) for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental, evolutionary acquisition approach. 

The upgrade to the GNT is the survivable/endurable UGNT which is funded with RDT&amp;E in this PE. The UGNT provides NUDET Detection Reports to end users through survivable/endurable USNDS communications via Milstar/Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) circuits. The GNT supports ITW/AA and NFM missions. The UGNT program modifies the baseline of the GNT program and deploys as an integral part of the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Survivable / Endurable Evolution (S2E2) Mobile Ground System (SMGS) units also in support of ITW/AA and NFM. The UGNT, when integrated with the SMGS, will perform NUDET event processing with fused NDS data from GPS and DSP. SMGS capability refers to the result of the S2E2 upgrade program for the Mobile Ground System (MGS) mission processing capability, including the integration of UGNT. The intended end state of UGNT integration is delivery of enhanced NUDET detection capabilities which meet survivable/endurable attack assessment requirements directed by the President, Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Joint Staff, and USSTRATCOM, delivering long-term, cost effective, multi-role, multi-mission space effects to the war fighter across the range of military operations.

This budget line includes systems engineering, research and development, on-orbit and field testing and end-to-end verification of USNDS space sensors, ground analysis and reporting systems in support of the five USNDS mission areas. Sensor integration for GPS IIF and GPS III are funded in their respective PEs.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NUDET Detection System (SPACE) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.

The 67A017 project funds efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. Through Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) the following types of activities are performed, but are not limited to, programs that extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts.  These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations. 

Global Sensor Watch Program provides an integrated SSA Tip and Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture which provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response (demonstrated by the SSA Ops Demo), multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.  Other efforts to support Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) in space include developing &amp; deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of deep space (S)High Inclination Orbits(HIO); optimizing intelligence community &amp; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) sensors to better support BMC2; developing &amp; executing Joint Functional Component Command (JFCC) for Space exercises such as Joint Space Operations Center (JSPOC) Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative (JETTI) to test &amp; optimize Space Control capabilities, concept of operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking; and improving legacy communication paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improve the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver X-XX weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Space Defense Center (NSDC), formerly the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), seeks to improve unity of effort and information sharing across the national security space community to effectively respond to potential future space threat events. The NSDC requires effective battle management, command and control (BMC2) to integrate and synchronize space and cyber forces and the intelligence community with efforts across all domains and to execute unity of effort through the core command and control functions of:  situation monitoring, planning, decision making, space force management and space force direction.  The NSDC will have the capability to develop, test, and integrate new space system tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in support of both DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) operations. Lessons learned from NSDC experimentation will inform requirements development for future BMC2 architectures.

Beginning with FY2019, NSDC funding in PE 1203940F is transferred to PE 1203620F, National Space Defense Center.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is knowledge of all aspects of space related to operations. As the foundation for space control, SSA encompasses surveillance of  all space objects and activities; detailed reconnaissance of specific space assets; monitoring space environmental conditions; monitoring cooperative space assets; gathering intelligence on adversary space operations; and conducting integrated command, control, communications, processing, analysis, dissemination, and archiving activities. SSA also encompasses the integration, exploitation and delivery of data sources to facilitate the battle management and command and control of space forces.  This program element fields, upgrades, modifies, modernizes, operationalizes, operates and maintains Air Force sensors and information integration capabilities within the SSA Space Surveillance network (SSN) while companion program element 1206425F, Space Situational Awareness Systems, develops new network sensors and improved information integration capabilities across the network. Activities funded in this program element (1203940F) focus on surveillance of objects in earth orbit to aid tasks including satellite tracking; space object identification; tracking and cataloging; satellite attack warning; notification of satellite flyovers to U.S. forces; space treaty monitoring; and technical intelligence gathering.

The 67A017 project funds efforts to upgrade, operationalize and extend the life of operational SSA sensors, as needed. Through Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) the following types of activities are performed, but is not limited to, programs that extend the serviceable life of assets and maintain critical capability by replacing aging and increasingly unsustainable components with modern and sustainable equipment. In addition, the SLEP itself may be designed to increase capabilities not currently realized. As the need arises in the execution year, funds in this project may be used to begin SLEPs on additional efforts. These efforts may include prototyping and technology demonstrations.

Global Sensor Watch Program provides an integrated SSA Tip and Cue capability that implements a survivable architecture which provides overlapping, assured, and viable surveillance options for executing event response (demonstrated by the SSA Ops Demo), multiple level security processing of SSA data and automated cross-sensor tipping and cueing around the globe.  Other efforts to support Battle Management Command &amp; Control (BMC2) in space include developing &amp; deploying advanced software algorithms to identify, acquire, characterize, and maintain custody of deep space (S)High Inclination Orbits(HIO); optimizing intelligence community &amp; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) sensors to better support BMC2; developing &amp; executing Joint Functional Component Command (JFCC) for Space exercises such as Joint Space Operations Center (JSPOC) Experimentation, Test and Training Initiative (JETTI) to test &amp; optimize Space Control capabilities, concept of operations (CONOPS) development to increase probability of survival for blue assets, and refining requirements across space enterprise; enhancing sensor performance to close the solar exclusion gap leveraging technologies such as optical daylight tracking; and improving legacy communication paths to support bi-directional machine-to-machine sensor communications enabling a more complete BMC2 capability.

Ground Based Radar Upgrades improve the sensitivity, search capabilities and CONOPS of existing SSA sensors to better support custody and fire control timelines.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system which operates through all weather. GPS supports both civil and military users in air, space, sea and land operations. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity and time. GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) sec 2281 which requires that the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC sec 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

PE 1206423F funds Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) for the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) and the GPS Enterprise Integrator (EI). This includes advanced concept development such as support for Regional Military Protection (RMP), systems analysis, modernized control segment development, modernization/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, mission planning development, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, test resources, systems engineering required to meet the Government's obligations to the international, military and civil communities, and system requirements verification. OCX acquisition was established to 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites, 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring, 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations, and 4) integrate Department of Defense (DoD) information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. GPS EI is responsible for architecture and system definition (the analysis and definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents) as well as for the planning, execution, and fielding of the GPS Enterprise.

OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, modernization initiatives, systems engineering, system development, resolving obsolescence issues, test and evaluation efforts, and mission operations. These activities support upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to enable efforts to protect U.S. Military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure OCX efforts meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities.

The GPS Enterprise consists of Space, Ground Control, Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) and User Equipment Segments. The Government is responsible for the integration of the GPS Segments such that they provide worldwide GPS capability to support the warfighter and over a billion national security, civil, Allied, and commercial GPS users.

The GPS EI project includes the efforts associated with the Government's prime contract tasks necessary to accomplish this critical integrating function with the entire GPS user community. The GPS EI maintains the GPS current architecture and system definition, controls and validates interfaces, ensures compatibility of Generation II and III systems, and develops/manages plans for execution and fielding of the GPS Enterprise. Further, GPS EI provides modeling, simulation, and technical analyses of impacts for Government-directed enterprise-level trades among the GPS segments leading to definition, management, maintenance, and evolution of the GPS Enterprise requirements and interface technical documents to build and ensure the integrity of the enterprise technical baseline, and perform system requirements verification.

In addition, the GPS EI project funds the technical evolution, risk reduction, enterprise-level testing and delivery of all GPS Enterprise capabilities.  Examples for Generation II include electronic protection and additional civil signals; for Generation III, additional anti-jamming protection. To accomplish this, GPS EI delivers Test and Verification capabilities, Requirements and Interface Management, and Systems Integration support across the Space, Control, and User Segments. In this capacity, GPS EI is responsible for managing this cross-program work to provide these and other capabilities.

GPS EI's analyses guides Government decisions to ensure efficient and effective synchronization and execution across all Generation II and III GPS programs. For Enterprise-wide integration to be successful, the GPS EI: works with the GPS and NDS prime contractor teams to develop plans for early risk reduction System Integration Demonstrations to ensure system interfaces and functionality meet user and system requirements; ensures all equipment and documentation is ready when needed; integrates and analyzes enterprise schedules; and conducts formal test and verification, including Requirement Verification Plans and System Test Plans and Procedures. GPS EI performs all these efforts across all GPS programs in all acquisition phases. The Government owns the GPS Enterprise system requirements and integration, and highly leverages the GPS EI team to eliminate the need to fund a development prime contractor to perform these functions. This enhances Government control, oversight and program accountability.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver GPS III Operational Control Segment (OCS) weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 1206392F and 1206398F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that were fielded or received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space based positioning, navigation and timing distribution system which operates through all weather. This project funds the research and development for the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX). This includes, but is not limited to, advanced concept development, systems engineering and analysis, modernized control segment and mission planning development, modernization/deployment of 17 monitoring stations, training simulators, integrated logistics support products, and test resources.

OCX acquisition was established to: 1) provide command and control of legacy and GPS III satellites; 2) incorporate situational awareness to support Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) and signal monitoring; 3) enable mission capability upgrades to support a warfighter effects-based approach to operations; and 4) integrate DoD information assurance and cybersecurity controls and capabilities. OCX funds will support efforts such as engineering studies and analyses, architectural engineering studies, trade studies, technology needs forecasting, technology development, systems engineering, system development, test and evaluation efforts and mission operations in support of upgrades and product improvements for military and civil applications necessary to support efforts to protect U.S. military and Allies' use of GPS. Additionally, funds will ensure efforts to meet current and future Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved required capabilities. 

Funding will also support new capabilities being developed by the GPS III Follow-on production program along with Regional Military Protection (RMP).  This effort will research potential impacts and develop solutions due to the GPS III Follow-On modifications, upgrade monitoring stations, and implement advances in collection and integration of RMP high-power regional Military-Code (M-Code) signals.

OCX Block 0 (through Iteration 1.5) is the Launch and Control System (LCS) intended to conduct Launch and Early Orbit (LEO) operations and the on-orbit checkout of all GPS III satellites. OCX Block 0 is a subset of OCX Block 1.

OCX Block 1 (adds Iterations 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1 to Block 0) fields the operational capability to control all legacy satellites and civil signals (L1C/A), military signals (L1P(Y), L2P(Y)) as well as the GPS III satellites and the modernized civil signal (L2C) and the aviation safety-of-flight signal (L5). In addition, Block 1 will field the basic operational capability to control the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code), and the globally compatible signal (L1C). It also fully meets information assurance/cyber defense requirements.

OCX Block 2 fields the advanced operational capability to control the advanced features of the modernized military signals (L1M and L2M M-Code). Blocks 1 &amp; 2 are being delivered concurrently as a result of the Nunn-McCurdy review.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Air Force is pursuing a "Block" approach for OCX in order to respond to warfighter capability requirements.  The strategy calls for capability (e.g., better signal maintainability, Unified S-Band (USB), Search and Rescue (SAR) GPS, and near-real time Command and control (C2)) on-ramps for the follow-on contract for GPS III Space Vehicles (SVs) (starting no earlier than SV11) which will require updates to the OCX ground segment. Enterprise studies will ensure GPS Enterprise synchronization across space and ground segments.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Enterprise Integrator (EI) is responsible for integrating, synchronizing, testing and verifying the three ACAT I Defense Acquisition Programs that constitute the GPS Enterprise.  Moreover, GPS EI is responsible for delivering reliable Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) signal capability to military operators, the civil user community, and international partners. Similarly, the Government Joint Program Office owns and approves the technical baseline and is responsible for the successful fielding of all the GPS Segments (space, control, and user). In order to successfully execute its responsibilities, the Government relies on GPS EI's specific expertise to create an enterprise architecture, integrate segment products, and verify the enterprise requirements are adequately met.

The GPS EI is also responsible for developing and managing the Enterprise technical baseline, which reflects multiple stakeholders' requirements.  Such stakeholders include the Department of Defense (DoD), foreign governments, industry, and the general public (through four Interface specifications).  Furthermore, GPS EI ensures GPS capabilities meet the warfighter's, civil agencies', commercial entities', international treaties', and over four billion global GPS users' needs. The GPS EI also manages the process through which the JROC validated requirements are matured and flowed down to the system segments, while remaining consistent with various interfaces. This enables the GPS system to meet Title 10 of the U.S. Code, Section 2281, mandated GPS capabilities and various other obligations to the international community that provide inter-operable PNT signals. GPS EI is also responsible for all aspects of schedule and technical alignment across the segments. Additionally, GPS EI is responsible for creating and managing plans that provide early exercise of the products under development, compatibility analysis, and inter-segment testing, which result in risk reduction.  The inter-segment tests are required to prove  GPS Next Generation Operational Control System's (OCX) interoperability with GPS III satellites, and modernized user equipment.  More importantly, it ensures backwards compatibility with GPS Block II satellites and legacy user equipment.  

GPS EI activity supports the Government Joint Program Office's GPS spectrum protection at international forums such as the International Telecommunications Union.  Such support consists of advocating on behalf of the United States Government when negotiating with foreign partners. In addition, GPS EI provides technical expertise to maintain relationships with other U.S. government agencies that include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Departments of State (DOS), Transportation, Homeland Security, and Commerce.

Spectrum expertise also ensures GPS priority over eight essential spectrum signals required for civil air navigation such as the safety of life signal and L5.  Spectrum Protection prevents encroachment from commercial or foreign entities, which results in the preservation of warfighter's reliable signal.  As a result,  military operations and the integrity of the global economic infrastructure are protected.  GPS EI is also the GPS enterprise expert on Cybersecurity, System Safety, and System Security, which ultimately ensures a protected GPS Signal for both the military and civil users.  GPS EI is accountable for the development, execution, and analysis of OCX, cybersecurity and associated test cases necessary to deliver a secure operational system.  

GPS EI supports the Government development and implementation of various Systems Engineering documents, defines the methods of verification, conducts the analyses or tests, and assists the government in leading Integrated System Tests.  In addition, GPS EI validates the system performance in various mission threat scenarios during its development. GPS EI provides in-depth technical expertise to enhance government control, oversight and program accountability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with a "back to basics" acquisition approach and exercise of strong oversight of development contractors, the Air Force is required to exercise complete ownership of the architecture, system definition, technical baseline, and integration of the GPS space, ground, and user segments. While this complex inter-segment integration is traditionally performed by a prime contractor under a systems development contract, for GPS, this approach requires the government to be the integrator. To execute this responsibility, the government leverages systems engineering and integration expertise from both Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractors and a Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor. The GPS EI function of the SE&amp;I contractor is currently funded within this PE. The SE&amp;I effort was originally procured in 2007 through a full and open competition, as was the new follow-on SE&amp;I contract awarded in 2015. The SE&amp;I follow-on strategy builds in year over year cost reductions as requirements stabilize.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

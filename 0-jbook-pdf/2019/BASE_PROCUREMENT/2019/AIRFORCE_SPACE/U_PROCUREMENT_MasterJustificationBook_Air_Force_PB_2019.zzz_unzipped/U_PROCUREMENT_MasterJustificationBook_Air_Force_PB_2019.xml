                                <proc:Description>Develop and acquire Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) satellites, mission control segment and cryptography for survivable, anti-jam, worldwide, secure communications for the strategic and tactical warfighter.  AEHF satellites will replenish the existing EHF system (Milstar) providing much higher capacity and data rate (5x increase over Milstar II) capabilities.  AEHF is a cooperative program that includes International Partners (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands).  The AEHF procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for AEHF 4-6 satellites.  CCS-C provides launch and early orbit support and on-orbit anomaly resolution. 
 
AEHF Space Vehicle-3 (SV-3) and SV-4 are derivatives of the first two AEHF satellites which were delivered on the AEHF System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract (RDT&amp;E funded).  SV-3 was successfully launched on 18 Sep 2013.  SV-4 has a projected launch availability of 1QFY19.

SVs 5 and 6 are being procured under the Department of Defense's Efficient Space Procurement (ESP) approach which enables stable production and strategic sub-tier management through the block buy of space vehicles employing fixed-price contracting.  The AEHF block buy of two satellites enables savings by reducing the effect of obsolescence and production breaks, allowing for economic buying of components, and optimizing production resources.  Additionally, ESP enables cost efficiencies with the prime and subcontractor team as well as predictability for the space industrial base.  SV-5 has a projected launch availability of 4QFY19. SV-6 has a projected launch availability of 2QFY20. 

The flyaway unit cost is not included on P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.

As of the FY2016 PB submission, space programs' satellite procurement funding has been re-categorized from appropriation 3020, Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF) to appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY2016 and beyond.  Total MPAF/SPAF procurement funding is $5,723.230M.  Total AEHF SV3 SV4 MPAF/SPAF funds are $3,095.260M.  Total AEHF SV5 SV6 MPAF/SPAF funds are $2,627.970M.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203604F.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>In FY 2019 AEHF will continue funding efforts such as aspects of the SV 5-6 production block buy, technical support to include obsolescence/Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) studies, systems engineering and integration (SE&amp;I) and AEHF Calibration Facility/Interim Command and Control (ACF/IC2) test asset support. Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain. Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.

On 31 Oct 2013, a Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) contract for the AEHF SV 5/6 Production and Launch Operations was definitized, with a period of performance from fiscal years 2012 through 2021.  The maximum total program funding liability is $2.232 billion (includes $227M in FY11 advanced procurement funds).</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) is a satellite ground terminal network comprised of two communication nodes (Schriever AFB &amp; Vandenberg AFB) and 15 antenna systems. The antennas
are distributed around the world at seven locations -- Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), Thule Tracking Station (TTS), and Telemetry and Commanding Station (TCS) at RAF Oakhanger, England -- to ensure global coverage for over 170 satellites in various orbits operating in a congested and contested environment. The AFSCN conducts an average of 450 satellite contacts per day supporting Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); Missile Warning; Communications; Weather; and Research and Development (R&amp;D) satellites for Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) operations. While most of the 450 satellite contacts/day are routine command and control (C2) activities, the AFSCN is also used for satellite emergencies (e.g. tumbling satellite) because its high power antennas are often the only earthbound assets that can contact a non-responsive satellite to re-establish command &amp; control. During FY 2017, the AFSCN supported 14 space vehicle emergencies resulting in the preservation of over $4.97B worth of satellites. In addition to routine and emergency satellite operations C2, the AFSCN provides support to launch vehicle and early orbit operations, ensuring worldwide antennas receive telemetry and transmit commands to newly orbiting satellites to initiate early orbit checkout. During FY 2017, the AFSCN supported 26 launches delivering $14.2B worth of satellites to their operational orbits. Finally, the AFSCN provides Factory Compatibility Testing (FCT) to ensure satellites and launch vehicles can communicate via the AFSCN before the satellite is launched. These funds are used to procure modernized equipment and SE&amp;I for the AFSCN to ensure the capability is available to support DoD, Intelligence community, and civil users.  Funds may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, support Enterprise Ground Service (EGS), Commercial Augmentation, and cybersecurity operations.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

Principal efforts include: 

AFSCN Interim Supply Support: procures support services, peculiar and common support materials, and required re-procurement data for the Consolidated Air Force Satellite Control Network Modifications, Maintenance and Operations (CAMMO) Contract, and to transition to government supply support.

AFSCN Commodity  Procurement: The Air Force will use various contract vehicles to address the highest priority concerns/issues.  Obsolescence and sustainment "worst actors" are prioritized annually in order of criticality to the mission. The potential for failed satellite contacts drives priority. In FY 2019, funds are planned to be used for Defensive Cyber Operations activities and other Cybersecurity related projects. Other FYDP projects include: Authentication, Authorization, Auditing/Host Based Security System (AAA/HBSS) implementation to external users, AFSCN test bed (ATB) replacements, continued cyber defense work, network automation, moving the ATB from a leased contractor facility to a government facility, Range/Network/Communication obsolescence replacements, and Multi-band &amp; Phased Array projects.

Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC): The RBC Program was initiated in Dec 2001 to modernize the legacy system. The RBC program replaces legacy remote ground antenna systems that have reached end of life. To date, RBC systems have been installed at VTS, DGS, TCS, GTS, HTS, NHS, and TTS. TTS completed in 1Q FY 2016. In addition, the Air Force is upgrading the electronics in the remaining eight serviceable systems. This "hybrid" architecture couples the RBC electronics with existing antennas and normalizes electronics across the network. A prototype effort was implemented in FY 2012 to validate the approach and the first two hybrid articles were awarded in FY 2013 to upgrade legacy systems at GTS and HTS. HTS Hybrid was operationally accepted in July 2017. A third article was awarded in FY 2014 to upgrade the legacy system at VTS and funds were applied in FY 2015 to DGS, TTS and FY 2016 to TCS-A, NHS-A. This project is required to prevent a significant increase to sustainment costs and decrease in operational capability of the already obsolete Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) system. There are several significant operational issues that must be corrected as soon as possible within the ARTS system and any delay to the RBC Hybridization of sites requires that ARTS be maintained and sustained well past its expected life. If RBC Hybridization is not sufficiently funded to keep ARTS operationally viable, the system will experience increased failure rates and lost contacts over time with the potential to impact or lose operational capability of on-orbit payloads that rely on the AFSCN for command and control. The antiquated AFSCN system is already operating at the very edge of its capacity supporting over 170 satellites. The RBC Hybridization project is intended to bring the system up to modern standards by FY 2022, and any delay in funding will push that completion date farther into the future, endangering additional satellite contacts and payloads. In addition, the Enhanced High Power Amplifier (EHPA) spacecraft anomaly resolution system will provide high power capability at four sites (GTS, VTS, NHS, and DGS), replaces obsolete parts, and  enables emergency satellite operations. The first article delivery of EHPA at GTS is scheduled to complete in FY 2018. The remaining EHPA procurements and deliveries (VTS, NHS, and DGS) will be executed as separate projects to be requested in future budget years.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $8.816 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

                                <proc:Justification>1) AFSCN Interim Supply Support (P-5): FY 2019 funding provides peculiar and common support material, required re-procurement data, and interim supply support management. In addition, funds procure the most urgently needed capital equipment replacements for items that exceed the O&amp;M dollar threshold. This equipment replaces items such as, but not limited to, high power amplifiers, processors, archival event recorders, and router switches, AFSCN Link Projection System (ALPS) equipment, legacy Electronic Scheduling Dissemination (ESD) 2.7 equipment and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) items which are at the top of the sustainers "worst actors" list and account for significant maintenance effort, down time, and lost or failed contacts.

2) AFSCN Commodity Procurement (P-5): FY 2019 funds are critical to ensuring telemetry, tracking, and commanding are provided for over 170 satellites and that satellite emergencies requiring high-power antennas can be supported.  These projects include Migration to Commercial Augmentation, EGS and Self Sufficient Transportables, Communication, Cyber and Range Upgrades.

3) RBC (P3a): No FY 2019 funding requested.  Ensures telemetry, tracking, and commanding are provided for over 170 satellites and that satellite emergencies requiring high-power antennas can be supported. 

4) FY 2019 funds will continue program office support and other related support activities.  Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain. Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>The Counter Communications System (CCS) Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) program provides expeditionary, deployable, reversible offensive space control (OCS) effects applicable across the full spectrum of conflict. It prevents adversary satellite communications (SATCOM) in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) including Command and Control (C2), Early Warning, and Propaganda; and hosts Rapid Reaction Capabilities in response to Urgent Needs. Acquisition Decision Memorandum (24 April 2009) directed all capabilities identified in the October 2006 CCS Block 20, Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved Capability Development Document (CDD) shall be accomplished as P3I upgrades to the CCS Block 10. No funding requested for CCS in FY 2019.

Funding for this exhibit and developmental funding for CCS is in Program Element 1206421F, BPAC 65A001 Counterspace Systems.

Bounty Hunter (BH) supports the Defensive Space Control of US systems in a specific AOR and provides the capacity to prevent effective adversary use of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I). The system was originally a response to Joint Urgent Operational Need.  In 2013 AF Requirements Oversight Council directed incorporation of BH capabilities into a Program of Record. Funds requested in FY19 is for Bounty Hunter.

Developmental funding for BH is in Program Element 1206421F, BPAC 65A013 Bounty Hunter.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>BOUNTY HUNTER (BH): All funding is for Bounty Hunter in FY 2019.  Funding in FY 2019 provides equipment (e.g., emitters, antennas, spectrum analyzers) upgrades to the currently deployed BH system to counter emerging Electro-magnetic Interference (EMI), and EMI upgrades to the second BH system currently in CONUS.

Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain. Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.

                                <proc:Description>The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program replaces legacy Milstar terminals and will provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF), protected high data rate communication for nuclear and conventional forces to include Presidential and National Voice Conferencing (PNVC). 

FAB-T will provide this new, highly secure, state-of-the-art capability for DoD platforms to include strategic platforms and airborne/ground command posts via Milstar, AEHF, and Enhanced Polar System (EPS) satellites. FAB-T terminals will also support the critical command and control (C2) of the Milstar, AEHF and EPS satellite constellations. In June 2014 the Air Force down-selected to Raytheon for production of FAB-T Command Post Terminals (CPT). Production contract options to produce CPT terminals were exercised after a successful Milestone C decision was approved September 1, 2015. In FY 2019, FAB-T will continue to pursue activities that ensure FAB-T terminal interoperability with the full AEHF satellite constellation. 

PNVC communication Baseband Interface Group (BIG) equipment purchases will provide voice encoding/decoding and encryption/decryption via KY-280s for use with Milstar and Advanced EHF satellite communication networks. The equipment will support Senior Leader Conferencing via Survivable Emergency Communication Networks (SECN) digitization and support, secure, survivable voice conferencing capability for the President and national senior leaders.  

In the prior years through FY 2014, FAB-T was in OPAF Line Item Number 836780.
In FY 2015 FAB-T was in OPAF Line Item Number 836700.
This exhibit is funded in PE 1203001F.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</proc:Description>

                                <proc:Description>The Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) System provides the DoD with high data rate military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) services in accordance with the Joint Space Management Board-approved MILSATCOM architecture (August 1996), the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)-approved MILSATCOM Capstone Requirements Document (October 1997), and JROC-approved WGS Operational Requirements Document (May 2000).  This program was originally conceived to augment the near-term "bandwidth gap" in warfighter communications needs.  Dual-frequency WGS satellites augment, then replace the DoD's Defense Satellite Communications System X-band service and augment one-way Global Broadcast Service Ka-band capabilities.  In addition, WGS provides a high capacity two-way Ka-band service.

WGS Block I consists of satellites 1-3.  These satellites were successfully launched on 10 October 2007, 3 April 2009, and 5 December  2009, respectively.   

WGS Block II consists of satellites 4-6.  Block II satellites are designed with slight modifications to better support the Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission.  Satellite 4 was successfully launched on 19 January 2012.  Satellite 5 was successfully launched on 24 May 2013.

A United States-Australia WGS partnership was codified in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 14 November 2007.  Australia provides funds needed to buy Space Vehicle-6 (SV-6) in exchange for access to constellation-wide (SVs 1-6) resources.  Satellite 6 was successfully launched on 7 August 2013.  SV-6 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.

WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) consists of satellites 7-10. The WGS procurement program element funds the Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) mission unique software and databases for the WGS B2FO satellites.   

A multilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand was codified in an MOU in January 2012.  The United States contributions include existing and programmed infrastructure, to include the acquisition, launch, operations, and sustainment costs of WGS 1-8, and the launch, operations, and sustainment of SV-9.  Other Partners' contributions fund SV-9 acquisition and support activities.  Each Partner provides funds needed to buy SV-9 in exchange for access to constellation-wide (SVs 1-9) resources commensurate with its level of contribution.  SV-9 is not included in the Procurement Quantities in these documents.

WGS-7 was successfully launched on 23 July 2015. WGS-8 was successfully launched on 7 December 2016. WGS-9 was successfully launched on 18 March 2017. WGS-10 will be launched in FY19.

Discussions for potential future partnerships regarding the WGS program continue in support of National Space Policy and improved operational efficiency.

The Air Force has been working to identify opportunities for more affordable, efficient commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) business arrangements.  Specifically, the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications Systems (MILSATCOM) Directorate has developed a five phase COMSATCOM pathfinder investment strategy to burn down risk targeting affordability and performance. 

In an FY2014 effort to study SATCOM capabilities to support Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) requirements, the WGS program invested $8.0M in what is known as COMSATCOM Pathfinder #1.  In Pathfinder #1, on-orbit commercial Ku-band transponders were purchased to support AFRICOM while demonstrating risk mitigation steps toward future innovative, affordable procurement of long term COMSATCOM capabilities. 

In FY2016, Congress added $26.0M for the COMSATCOM Pathfinder effort.  Pathfinder #2 will purchase commercial pre-launch transponders that will include protection features.
 
With FY2017 funding, the Air Force will execute Pathfinder #3.  Pathfinder #3 builds on the Pathfinder #2 scope and incorporates access to commercial ground stations.  The current plan for Pathfinder #3 is to use an Other Transactions Authority (OTA) contract to purchase commercial transponders and ground station hardware at a commercial site.  Under the OTA, the government and contractor team will demonstrate the ability to flexibly reassign bandwidth between multiple users and work cooperatively to refine that process over a period of five years. The current interpretation of the OTA statutes within the Air Force indicates that this type of OTA requires RDT&amp;E funds.  Congress realigned $30M FY17 from SPAF to RDT&amp;E for Pathfinder #3. 

In FY2018-2019, the Air Force programmed funds for Pathfinders #4-5.  The Pathfinder #4 acquisition strategy is being developed to ensure it will continue to address portions of the four goals in FY15 and one goal from FY16 that were outlined in FY15 &amp; FY16 NDAAs. These goals were initiated in the first three Pathfinders programs. They are 1 - Cost Effective and Strategic Method to Acquire COMSATCOM; 2- Incentivize Private-sector Participation and Investment; 3- Provide Flexible (Surge) Capacity; 4- Enable Cost Accounting and Control; 5- Demonstrate potential to achieve ‘Order-of-Magnitude' improvements in COMSATCOM capability. Pathfinder #5 in conjunction with Pilot Phase #3 will demonstrate the use of commercial high throughput/capacity satellites (HTS/HCS). This demonstration will meet the objective of the "order of magnitude goal (#5) as stated above.  Pathfinder #5 will need to develop, in conjunction with Pilot Phase #2 and Pilot Phase #3, the necessary interfaces for USG terminals to access the high throughput satellite capability (data packets - "bits).  Pathfinder #5 will shift from only procuring bits to developing, integrating and demonstrating an architecture that enables the terminals to achieve "order of magnitude improvements only available through the use of bits.    

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

The flyaway unit cost is not included on P-40 exhibit because there are multiple P-5 Cost Analysis exhibits.

As of the FY2016 PB submission, space programs' satellite procurement funding has been re-categorized from Appropriation 3020, Missile Procurement Air Force (MPAF), to Appropriation 3021, Space Procurement Air Force (SPAF), in FY2016 and beyond.  Total MPAF/SPAF procurement funding is $3,265.414M.  Total WGS SV1-SV5 MPAF funds are $1,619.426M.  There are no WGS SV1-SV5 SPAF funds.  Total WGS Block II Follow-On (B2FO) MPAF/SPAF funds are $1,645.988M.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."</proc:Description>

                                <proc:Description>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three-dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. GPS must comply with Title 10 United States Code (USC) Sec. 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes, and 51 USC Sec. 50112, which requires that GPS complies with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.

The system is composed of three segments: User Equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), Space (funded under PE 1203265F, 1203165F, and 1203269F), and a Control Network (funded under PE 1206423F and 1203165F). Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funding for GPS III, including development and acquisition of Space Vehicles (SV) 01-02, is in PE 1203265F, Project 67A019, GPS III Space Segment. The satellites broadcast high- accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation waypoints. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to maintain system precision in three dimensions to 16 meters spherical error probable worldwide. Additionally, GPS supports the United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) mission and provides strategic and tactical support to the following Department of Defense (DoD) missions: Joint Operations by providing capabilities for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT); Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I); Special Operations; Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Defense-Wide Mission Support (DWMS); Air Mobility; and Space Launch Orbital Support.

GPS III is the next generation of SVs to join the GPS constellation. GPS III Follow-On production SVs will deliver significant enhancements, including a new civil (L1C) Galileo-compatible signal and enhanced anti-jam power. Regional Military Protection (RMP), which provides the ability to deliver high-power regional Military Code (M-Code) signals in specific areas of intended effect, a redesigned USNDS, and two auxiliary payloads (Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS) and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA)) will be added no earlier than SV 11. The SAR/GPS payload provided by Canada will fill a validated National Search and Rescue Committee requirement to provide enduring, space-based distress alerting capability to detect, locate, and relay distress alerts to fulfill its responsibilities under international agreements for Search and Rescue. LRA, built by the Naval Research Lab (NRL), is a passive reflector that will improve accuracy and provide better ephemeris data. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) funds the integration costs of the LRA.

Upon Milestone C approval, the Air Force will procure SVs 13-32 via annual contract options exercised using Space Procurement, Air Force (SPAF) funds consistent with full-funding policy under an annual buy approach. Procurement funding for SVs 13-32 will be transferred to PE 1203269F, GPS III Follow-On, beginning in 2020.

The Air Force GPS directorate received USD(AT&amp;L) approval to purchase GPS III SVs 09-10 at the December 2014 Defense Acquisition Board in order to sustain the constellation while competitive options are pursued. The GPS III SVs 09-10 purchase will be on the current Lockheed Martin contract as technical equivalents of SVs 01-08. SV 09 is funded with FY2014 Missile Procurement, Air Force (MPAF) advance procurement and FY2015 MPAF regular procurement. SV 10 is funded with FY2015 MPAF advance procurement and FY2016 SPAF regular procurement.

The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

                                <proc:Description>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate time, three-dimensional position, and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. GPS satisfies validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid navigation for military aircraft, ships, ground vehicles and personnel. The system is comprised of three segments: (1) satellites, (2) a ground control, and (3) user equipment. The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals that are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. The ground control network updates the navigation messages broadcast from the satellites to provide system vectors to target location or navigational way points. Funds in this line support various GPS specific production efforts associated with the ground control and user equipment segments. 

KEY DATA LOADING INSTALLATION FACILITY (KLIF)/GPS SECURITY DEVICE: The KLIF facilitates the programming of black key (cryptographic) algorithms into the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to provide accurate positioning solutions for GPS users using secure equipment. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

                                <proc:Description>PE 1203179F Integrated Broadcast Service
The IBS is a multi-sensor, multi-source, system of systems for the dissemination of integrated threat warning blue force tracking information. IBS provides intelligence producers and information sources the means to analyze and disseminate strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence and threat warning information directly to the warfighter. The IBS operational baseline represents the migration, integration, and consolidation of existing tactical data dissemination into a future common architecture message format.

Integrated Broadcast Service Procurement was previously funded in PE 0305179F in FY17 and FY18 Other Procurement/ BA 03: Electronics and Telecommunications Equip/BSA 2: Intelligence Programs P-1 Line #14; 832070 Intelligence Comm Equipment BP83.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>PE 1203179F Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) - P40A
FY19 funding for IBS procurement efforts are focused in the following areas:

1. CIB UPLINK SITE (CUS) TACTICAL INFORMATION PROCESSOR AND ONLINE FUSION FACILITY (TIPOFF): TIPOFF serves as the control system for the CIB Uplink Site and interface to the IBS Network Services (IBS-NS). Each major release of the software incorporates approved requirements as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability requirements, and system security. The new release supports migration to CIB Uplink Sites.

2. COMMON INTERACTIVE BROADCAST PLANNING TOOL (CIB-PT): The CIB-PT provides the COCOM Planners an integrated software/hardware mechanism to allocate space-based communications resources to theater and national producers, specifically to reliably optimize the timeliness of scarce bandwidth allocation of extremely time-critical messages. Each major release of the software/hardware incorporates updated producer prioritization, bandwidth allocation, mission monitoring and interfaces to the STRATCOM systems as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security compliance to achieve threshold requirements. 

3. COMMON MESSAGE FORMATE PARSER LIBRARY (CMFPL): The CMF repository is required for the automatic exchange of data among processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) systems. This effort procures the infrastructure for dynamic software library updates for multiple operating systems essential to broadcast operation.

4. IBS V&amp;V Environment: Procures simulation and stimulation tools to certify and verify mission equipment for operational use. Included is the MULTI-AREA REMOTE SIMULATOR (MARS) a component of the IBS verification and validation process used to emulate multiple systems messaging under operational conditions and the UNIVERSAL CIB TEST SET (UCTS) a component that emulates the UHF SATCOM environment.

5. TERMINAL, DATALINK, &amp; ENTERPRISE SERVER MITIGATION: Funds direct mission support activities such as verification &amp; validation documentation; uplink receive and transmit terminal upgrade, enhancements and spares; mitigation; CMF product support; JOINT TACTICAL DATA LINK, i.e., Link 16 support; product documentation; studies and analyses; IBS Web Support and contractor system engineering activities.

6. IBS-NS: Scaling capability is required for messaging under operational use. Funds approved modernization of Global IBS Network Servers (GINS) and Theater Interface Nodes (TINS), technology refreshment and integration as necessitated by mission changes, system interoperability, and system security.</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>Space Communications Security (COMSEC) procures cryptographic products to operate in the space environment and for ground nodes that link to space assets. Space COMSEC equipment is a foundational element in achieving AF space and information superiority. Space COMSEC provides cybersecurity (authentication and confidentiality) for DOD satellite platforms. Space COMSEC is an enabler for space system compliance with DoDI 8581.01 - Information Assurance (IA) Policy for Space Systems Used by the Department of Defense. Space COMSEC mission provides communications security products and lifecycle sustainment support to all DoD satellite systems and commercial systems supporting DOD missions. Secure communication allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision superiority, the key to successful application of the military instrument of national power in modern, high-tempo, full spectrum operations. Space COMSEC equipment protects information such as warfighter positions, mission planning, target strikes, commanders' orders, intelligence, force strength, and force readiness and ensures adversaries cannot interpret, manipulate, or destroy information. When an adversary is capable of interpretation, manipulation, or destruction of the information used by the warfighter, DoD military forces will suffer significant and/or devastating mission degradation that can result in loss of life and resources and/or exceptionally grave damage to national security. Space COMSEC enables secure command and Control (C2) of satellites and prevents unauthorized access and destruction. It enables secure transmission of satellite systems' health and status telemetry data (satellite health and relative orbital position) to ground control stations, thus protecting critical information about the capabilities of DoD satellite systems. The capability of a system must be protected from an adversary to avoid exploitation of a system weakness/limitation, knowledge of which could assist an adversary in a successful mission against DoD military forces. Space COMSEC also provides secure transmission of information collected by satellite sensors (mission data), which provides the warfighter an integrated view of the battle space. Space COMSEC provides for secure SATCOM, positioning, navigation, timing, weather, nuclear detection and early warning missions. Space COMSEC also enables Transmission Security (TRANSEC) for
space platforms. Space COMSEC mission procures crypto end items and logistics elements to support developing and operational space systems.

Funding for this effort is in program element (PE) 1203140F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>a. Products: FY19 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC products to meet developing and operational space program needs. Space COMSEC products include End Crypto Units (ECU), Embedded Solutions (ES), TRANSEC and ancillaries. Due to low volume production quantities and high reliability design, Space COMSEC products can range in price from $10K per unit to $2M per unit. As a commodity item, Space COMSEC procures standard crypto products which enable minimized lifecycle footprints. Space COMSEC procures from multiple crypto vendors; however, with the low volume consumption by space programs, the space crypto industry base is less than a dozen companies.  Items procured during execution may change based on critical equipment needed to support current Air Force mission requirements. Contractor support costs are included as part of the Space COMSEC products funding line in order to provide for end item operational capability.


b. Logistics: FY19 funding provides for the production of Space COMSEC Logistics elements. Space COMSEC products typically have a 20 to 40 year lifecycle to support development, launch and operation of multiple Air Force and DoD space systems. Space COMSEC is provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the space system developing contractors and operational ground stations. Space COMSEC products are high cost critical assets and are organically sustained to include component level maintenance exclusively by the Air Force. Logistics procures the necessary lifecycle sustainment elements required to meet the 40 year mission requirements. Logistics elements include, but not limited to, specialized test sets, certified training materials and courses, maintenance manuals, provisioning, spare components, and modifications. Contractor support costs are included as part of the Space COMSEC logistics funding line in order to provide for end item operational capability.</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) fills validated Joint Service requirements for worldwide, accurate, common grid three-dimensional positioning/navigation for military aircraft, ships, and ground personnel. The consistent accuracy, unaffected by location or weather and available in real time, significantly improves effectiveness of reconnaissance, weapons delivery, mine countermeasures and rapid deployment for all services. The system is composed of three segments: user equipment (funded under Program Element (PE) 1203164F), satellites and a control network. The satellites broadcast high-accuracy data using precisely synchronized signals which are received and processed by user equipment installed in military platforms. This equipment computes the platform position and velocity and provides steering vectors to target locations or navigation way points. The control segment provides daily updates to the navigation messages broadcasted from the satellites to maintain system precision.

The GPS IIF program will continue On-Orbit Support on the Launch and On-Orbit Support (LOOS) firm fixed price services contract with a period of performance from 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Mar 2017. The LOOS contract will end on 31 Mar 2017 and IIF will transition to sustainment. The contract services includes: launch readiness activities, launch and on-orbit checkout of up to twelve GPS IIF Space Vehicles (SVs), storing, maintaining, and transportation of up to twelve GPS IIF SVs, on-orbit operations for up to twelve GPS IIF SVs, quick reaction support, anomaly resolution, anomaly investigation, and contract closeout. The GPS IIF program will finish contract closeout activities in the 2nd quarter of FY2017.

GPS IIF is the follow-on program to IIR-M (last launch Aug 2009) and was awarded in 1995 to Rockwell International (now Boeing, El Segundo, California). The contract was modified in 2002 for the modernization of all IIF SVs. Of the 12 satellite vehicles contracted for, 12 have been launched and are successfully on orbit (the 12th was launched in February 2016).

Block IIF was launched on the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). Launch schedules are established based on constellation sustainment needs and launch manifest constraints. The system hosts the Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) funded under PE 1203913F.

The acquisition strategy for the Block IIF satellites was a competitive multi-year contract for 6 satellites awarded in FY1996. Options for 6 additional Space Vehicles (SVs) were exercised in FY2004 and FY2005 (3 each year). Block IIF satellites have been modernized to include a new military signal and a second and third civil signal.

                                <proc:Description>PE 1203601F MILSATCOM TERMINALS

MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (MILSATCOM) joint-service systems collectively provide a broad range of satellite communication capabilities, including secure, jam-resistant, 24-hour worldwide communications to meet essential strategic, tactical and general-purpose operational requirements. MILSATCOM terminals support communications requirements for the President and Secretary of Defense, unified and specified commanders, uniformed services and defense agencies. Procurement funding is in program element (PE) 1203601F, MILSATCOM Terminals, except where otherwise noted.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $2.383 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>AIR FORCE WIDEBAND ENTERPRISE TERMINALS (AFWET) TERMINAL MODERNIZATION: AFWET terminals form the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) backbone of the DoD Information Network (DoDIN), operating over Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Defense Satellite Communications System, commercial and Allied satellites. These Enterprise terminals support the command and control requirements of Combatant Commanders worldwide and the communication requirements of the President, Secretary of Defense, Department of State (DoS), US strategic and tactical forces, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Air Force is responsible for terminal equipment at Air Force operated and maintained Enterprise ground terminal locations.  In FY2019, the Air Force funds will extend the life of the system, sustain operational suitability, safety and effectiveness, and maintain high interoperability with other DoD, Army, Navy, and Air Force strategic and tactical terminals. Procurement includes terminal modernization, installation, engineering, integration and site preparation, including radomes, facility monitoring systems, power and communication infrastructure, acceptance testing, Interconnect Facility (ICF), initial spares, Product Support Services (PSS), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS), system engineering, training and other related activities.  Installation, integration and site preparation costs change substantially based on location.  Life extension and modernization efforts also provide incidental increases in capability, allowing for full utilization of WGS capabilities, compliance with directives on the usage of Internet Protocol, adherence to Unified Capabilities Requirements, compliance with DISA and National Security Agency directives and more efficient and effective usage of satellite resources for jam-resistant and anti-scintillation wideband links. 
  
GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE (GBS): This AF-led joint program implements a worldwide high-capacity satellite broadcast information system to provide a continuous, one-way, high-speed, high-volume flow of classified and unclassified data and imagery to garrisoned, deployed or moving forces. GBS provides DoD some relief from reliance on leased commercial satellite communications. GBS Receive Suites provide lower-echelon AF users with efficient high-data-rate in-theater to many distributed information sources via satellite-hosted GBS packages. In addition to Prime Mission Equipment, FY2019 funds will fund studies (e.g., part obsolescence, encapsulation of modem, antenna trades, Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) ORD requirements), integration and installation, technical manual updates, Diminishing Manufacturing Supply (DMS), spares, systems engineering, test, training, A&amp;AS, upgrades, incorporation of Transmission Security (TRANSEC), and other related activities.  
 
a.  GBS RECEIVE SUITES: The receive suites link users to information sources via GBS, offering worldwide service.  
 
b.  GBS PORTABLE RECEIVE SUITES: These are Rucksack and Suitcase variants of the GBS terminals required by Special Operations Forces in forward operating areas.  
 
c.  INTERIM NON-TRANSEC MODEM:  Interim non-TRANSEC solution was operationally accepted Nov 16.  This solution will be used until a TRANSEC solution is Operationally Accepted (OA).

d.  JOINT INTERNET PROTOCOL MODEM (JIPM): On November 13, 2014, DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) re-directed the JIPM acquisition strategy to a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution.

e.  TRANSEC MODEM: GBS was funded in FY2017 thru FY2019 to continue a TRANSEC solution. 
    
f.  GBS BROADCAST MANAGER: The Satellite Broadcast Manager (SBM) systems at two of DISA's Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECC) that provide the GBS broadcast to the GBS Receive Suites worldwide.   

MILSATCOM SUSTAINMENT MODIFICATIONS: Provides minor modifications for MILSATCOM systems currently in sustainment and those currently fielded. No FY2019 funding is requested for PE 1203605F SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS (SATCOMS).

Continue program office and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, etc.

Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain.  Activities may include, but are not limited to program office support, studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.

                                <proc:Description>The Air Force requests funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program in two separate P-1 line items in compliance with the Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 Appropriation Acts. Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item. Launch capability will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) P-1 line item. Both line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit. To comply with Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Air Force plans to end the current EELV Launch Capability at the end of Fiscal year 2019.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2020, the EELV budget request will be in a single P-1 line.
 
This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements, but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. 

The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support required to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter, national security, and other Government space lift missions while fostering interagency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified launch vehicle providers. 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203953F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>Fiscal Year 2019 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (Infrastructure) procurement funding is required to support launch and acquisition of National Security Space (NSS) launch vehicles. Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (Infrastructure) is annually funded and includes, but is not limited, to systems and factory engineering, program management, standard integration/testing, launch and range activities, infrastructure, parts obsolescence mitigation, post mission analysis, studies and analysis, support costs, non-recurring engineering (NRE) and other efforts necessary to achieve Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practice (ODMSP) compliance, to include completing Phase 1 launches that slip beyond 30 September 2019. Funds are also required for fully funded Phase 1A competitive missions with related infrastructure, studies/analysis to include Launch Vehicle (LV) and Satellite Vehicle (SV) Early Integration Studies (EIS), postponement fees, and support costs which are annually funded. Continue program office support and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to, studies, technical analysis, etc. Fiscal Year 2019 is the final year for EELV Launch Capability funding. 

Launch Services (EELV) is requested under a separate P-1 line item in accordance with the direction in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2013.  
 
A revised Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), dated 7 Oct 2011 provides a cost share agreement for the Phase 1 Launch Capability.   This PE contains only the Air Force position. 

The SV Program Offices are responsible for funding mission unique integration/testing.</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>The Air Force requests funding for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program in two separate P-1 line items in compliance with the Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014 Appropriations Acts. Launch services will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Space) P-1 line item. Launch capability will be executed from the Evolved Expendable Launch Veh (Infrastructure) P-1 line item. Both line items are necessary to achieve successful placement of National Security Space (NSS) space vehicles (SVs) on-orbit.  To comply with Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Air Force plans to end the current EELV Launch Capability at the end of Fiscal year 2019.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2020, the EELV budget request will be in a single P-1 line.  Fiscal Year 2017 was the final ordering period for the Phase 1 block buy contract. 

This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares. Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix (medium through heavy) of vehicles in the program. EELV procures launch services and is not a weapon system. The program provides launch capacity for the Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements, but does not take ownership of any specific launch hardware. The requirements for EELV launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements. "To Complete" projections include only known requirements at this time. 

The EELV program is a Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) Acquisition Category (ACAT)1D program that acquires launch services to provide critical space support to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter, national security, and other Government space lift missions while fostering inter-agency and commercial cooperation. The EELV program provides satellite delivery to specific orbits through certified Launch Vehicle (LV) providers. 

The Air Force, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agreed to a coordinated strategy for certification of New Entrants to launch payloads in support of NSS and other USG requirements which has so far resulted in the certification of one New Entrant. The Air Force continues to actively work with potential New Entrants to reliably launch NSS requirements. The Government may award early integration contracts to ensure each potential offeror's launch system is compatible with the intended payload. As of Fiscal Year 2018, the Air Force's intent is to compete as much as possible all launch service procurements where more than one certified provider can service the required reference orbit.

In fiscal year 2019, this appropriation is funded to support two Propulsive EELV Secondary Payload Adapters (ESPA). One Propulsive ESPA is assigned to a specific launch service while the other Propulsive ESPA is currently unassigned, but will be designated for a future launch service.  Beginning in fiscal year 2020, the Air Force plans to transfer the Propulsive ESPA funding to a new program and appropriation.  

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1203953F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>Fiscal Year 2019 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (Space) procurement funding is to acquire launch services to provide critical space support required to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter, national security, and other Government space lift missions while fostering interagency and commercial cooperation. Launch services include, but are not limited to, launch vehicle manufacturing, mission success incentives, recurring costs for Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practice, EELV secondary payload adapter/rideshare, launch propellants, independent mission assurance, evaluation and certification of potential New Entrants, early integration activities and analysis/support, and any other related studies to support mission requirements. The Air Force is responsible for funding its own missions.  In fiscal year 2019, there is a one time procurement of a Long Duration Propulsive EELV Secondary Payload Adapters (ESPA) not associated with a launch service. 

All non-Air Force EELV launch services are funded within their respective entities (e.g. NRO, Navy). Continue program office support and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to, studies, technical analysis, etc.</proc:Justification>

                                        <proc:Remarks>Flyaway is not applicable to a program that procures launch services. Unit cost varies due to the mix (medium through heavy lift) of vehicles in the program. 

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the NRO and the Air Force, dated 7 October 2011, specifies a 60/40 Air Force/NRO share ratio for Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Mission Assurance.

All non-Air Force launch services are funded by their respective agencies.

System Engineering and Integration increased due to ramping-up from one New Entrant Certification effort in FY16 to four in FY19.

Mission Assurance also increased due to going from one New Entrant Certification effort in FY16 to four in FY19.</proc:Remarks>

The Space Based Infrared System's (SBIRS) primary mission is to provide initial warning of a ballistic missile attack on the US, its deployed forces and its allies. SBIRS enhances detection and improves reporting of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles. SBIRS provides increased detection and tracking performance in order to meet requirements in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD). SBIRS will consist of satellites in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) and in Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) with an integrated, centralized ground station serving all SBIRS space elements, Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and other program related support activities. The HEO payloads operate on a classified host.

SBIRS 3-8 SATELLITES:

SBIRS GEO-3 and 4 satellites are derivatives of the first two GEO satellites which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&amp;E funded). The GEO-3 and 4 satellite production efforts are necessary to meet constellation requirements. In Dec 2008, the Department approved the procurement of GEO-3 and 4 satellites and the HEO-3 and 4 payloads using a Cost-Plus contract.  In order to minimize the number of storage actions and costs associated with aligning the SBIRS launches to the earliest assigned Initial Launch Capability (ILC) date of Apr 2016, the GEO-3 satellite completed production and was placed into storage in Jul 2015.  The GEO-4 satellite launched as the third flight (GEO-4 Flight-3) in Jan 2017.  The GEO-3 (Flight-4) satellite launched  Jan 2018.

SBIRS GEO-5 and 6 satellites are derivatives of the GEO-3 and 4 satellites and will be replacements for GEO-1 and 2. A four phased contract approach awarded non-recurring engineering and parts obsolescence using advanced procurement funds in Sep 2012, followed by award of long lead items in Feb 2013, full production in Jun 2014, and technical refresh in Jun 2015. The GEO-5 and 6 technical refresh contract modification modernizes the existing spacecraft bus design to improve commonality across Air Force and Government satellite programs, and enable compatibility with multiple launch vehicles. The full production effort includes 2 satellites with persistent infrared missile and threat warning payloads, launch vehicle integration, launch and early orbit test, dual communication band modification (unified SBand), and contractor operations support through operational acceptance.

For the GEO 5-6 block buy, the FY 2013 NDAA authorizes six years of incremental production funding and limits the incrementally funded contract obligation to $3,900M. The years of incremental funding are FY 2013-2018. Advance procurement was appropriated in FY 2011 and FY 2012. GEO 5-6 advance procurement and incremental funding are attributed to FY 2013 for the purposes of identifying full funding for procurement end items. Each year of appropriation FY 2013-2018 is in two parts, the incrementally funded contract amount and annual program support costs. The incrementally funded amount complies with the NDAA cap.

SBIRS HEO-3 and 4 payloads are replenishments for HEO-1 and 2 payloads, which were delivered on the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract (RDT&amp;E funded). The HEO-1 and 2 payloads are on-orbit and certified for Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) missile warning operations and certified for technical intelligence operations. The HEO-3 payload is on-orbit and has completed its initial checkout. The HEO-4 payload was delivered to the classified host in May 2015.

Total GEO 3-4 3020/3021 funds are $2,845.737M.
Total GEO 5-6 3020/3021 funds are $3,449.057M.
Total HEO 3-4 3020/3021 funds are $1,146.672M.

SBIRS MOBILE AND FIXED SITE COMMUNICATIONS/ELECTRONIC REPLACEMENT: This effort procures DSP and SBIRS assets to maintain the Data Processing Sub-System. Fixed site examples
include, but are not limited to, legacy receiver, antenna drive system, Spacecraft Simulator RF, MCS display, Rapid Delog (instantaneous translation of computer data to a human-readable format), Sybase database obsolescence, communications and network routers, and switches and time server replacements. Mobile system examples include, but are not limited to, aging radio frequency communications equipment, aging antenna equipment, aging electrical equipment and cabling, and unsupportable data processing subsystem components. Funding for this effort is in program element 1203915F and was previously funded under Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF).

SBIRS SURVIVABLE ENDURABLE EVOLUTION (S2E2): The S2E2 effort recapitalizes the DSP Mobile Ground System (MGS) DSP Mobile Ground Terminals with SBIRS Mobile Ground Terminals (SMGT).
The MGS is the only US Survivable and Endurable (S/E) Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) system (S/E TW/AA). It is the critical Situation Monitoring element in three national-level architectures: Integrated TW/AA System, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Critical Nodes, and Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). USSTRATCOM needs AFSPCs global S/E TW/AA operational capabilities to meet President of the United States, Joint Staff, Combatant Commander and Forward User (FU) requirements for continuous, persistent, and enduring TW/AA non-imaging infrared (NIR) for Missile Warning and static events, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) detection and reporting across all phases of military operations. The current MGS can only process DSP data for strategic Missile Warning and NUDET detection. This effort will address long-standing obsolescence/supportability and cyber security concerns of the MGS, enable the MGS to process SBIRS and DSP satellite data. Training software, spares and integration of Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs) are included. The shelters will also be upgraded for increased protection from high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) per MIL-STD-188-125-2. Funding for this effort is in program element 1203915F and was previously funded under Other Procurement Air Force (OPAF).

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

                                <proc:Description>The United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) provides a near real-time worldwide, highly survivable/endurable capability to detect, locate, and report any nuclear detonations in the atmosphere of the earth or in near space. The USNDS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), dated 21 Jan 2004, documents the requirements for space-based NUDET detection. Space-based NUDET detection is also mandated by Public Law 110-181, dated 28 Jan 2008, which directs the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) to maintain the capability for space-based nuclear detection at or above 2008 capability levels. USNDS supports NUDET detection requirements across five mission areas: Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), Nuclear Force Management (NFM), Space Control (SC), Treaty Monitoring (TM) and a classified mission.

The USNDS 6 program is jointly sponsored and funded by the Department of Defense (DoD), through the U.S. Air Force (AF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its Nuclear Detonation Detection (NA-22) office, respectively. NNSA/NA-22 supplies USNDS space sensors as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the AF USNDS Program Office, which is responsible for all acquisition and systems engineering, integration and test (SEIT) activities on space vehicles (SVs), to include Global Positioning System (GPS) and additional hosts, and their supporting ground control segments. The AF directly funds the procurement of the USNDS 6 ground segment (described below).

DoD funds its contribution to the Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) program in Program Element (PE) 1203913F with RDT&amp;E, SPAF, and O&amp;M dollars. NDS payload integration onto GPS satellites is funded in the GPS III Space Segment PE 1203265F for GPS III SVs. NDS payload integration onto Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites is funded by NNSA/NA-22.

USNDS consists of space sensors and complex ground segments. The space segment sensors, funded by DOE, consists of three nuclear detection sensor payloads: the Radiation Detection Capability (RADEC) payload for Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, the Global Burst Detection (GBD) payload for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) platforms (GPS satellites), and the Space Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS) payload for GEO platforms (classified GEO hosts).  Together, these sensors and associated communications capability provided by the host satellites comprise the global NUDET space segment detection capability for the USNDS.  Space sensors communicate NUDET indications to the fixed ground segment (the RADEC Data Processor (RDP), the Integrated Correlation and Display System (ICADS)) and the deployable mobile ground segment (survivable Ground NDS Terminals (GNTs), and the five survivable/endurable Universal Ground NDS Terminals (UGNTs), when fielded.  The ground segment provides ground receiving analysis and reporting capabilities to national authorities, commands, and forward users as well as Department of State for the Treaty Monitoring and Verification mission. 

The ground control segment is being modernized and continuously improved through an incremental evolutionary acquisition approach. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

                                <proc:Description>The Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) acquires small launch services to deliver affordable, flexible spacelift for small payloads.  The small launch program complements the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program with multiple options to acquire dedicated spacelift and rideshare services for developmental, demonstration, and small operational space vehicles.  The Spacelift Capability Production Document approved 31 May 2016 supports the requirement for small spacelift capability (0-8,000 lbs to low Earth through geostationary transfer orbit). 

In Fiscal Year 2019, the Air Force is establishing this procurement line to satisfy the small launch procurement requirements.  Previously, small launch funding resided in the satellite program budgets.  This change aligns launch service procurement activities with the necessary funding under SMC's Launch Enterprise.  This approach is now consistent across Air Force procured launch services and allows the Air Force the flexibility to manage dynamic manifest requirements as new launch service providers emerge.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

This program does not require and does not include advance procurement or initial spares.  Flyaway Unit Cost is not applicable and Weapon System Unit Cost are not representative due to the mix of vehicles in the program.  RSLP procures launch services and is not a weapon system.  The program provides launch capacity for the Government National Launch Forecast (NLF) requirements, but does not take ownership of any specific launch vehicle.  The requirements for small launch services are derived from multiple spacecraft requirements.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1206860F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>This program, Item Small Launch Service, is a new start.

Fiscal Year 2019 RSLP procurement funding acquires small launch and rideshare services to satisfy Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter, national security, and other Government spacelift missions.  Launch services include, but are not limited to, launch vehicle manufacturing, mission success incentives, recurring costs for Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practice, secondary payload adapter/rideshare hardware, rideshare services, launch propellants, launch system refurbishment, mission specific design modifications, flightworthiness testing, do-no-harm analysis, independent mission assurance, early integration activities and analysis/support, and any other related studies to support mission requirements.  RSLP procurement includes program office support and other related support activities that may include, but are not limited to cybersecurity, program management, financial management, systems engineering, FFRDC, studies, technical analysis, etc..</proc:Justification>

                                <proc:Description>The Space Fence effort is a system of ground-based sensors that improves upon the former Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS), a Very High Frequency (VHF) radar operational from 1961 to 2013. The Space Fence will provide a more accurate and timely detection capability of smaller orbiting objects, primarily in low-earth orbit (LEO). The system will use higher frequency S-band radars at globally dispersed sites. As a result, it will greatly expand the uncued detection and tracking capacity of the Space Surveillance Network, from around 20,000 to up to 100,000+ objects, while working in concert with other network sensors. Space Fence will be delivered in FY2019.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1206426F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>This program is a new start.

Funding in FY19 is required for interim contractor support (ICS), energy costs, Space Fence Operation Center (SOC) operators, and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS). In addition, begin program office support for rapid response to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain. Such activities may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.</proc:Justification>

Permanent modifications are configuration changes to in-service systems and equipment that correct materiel or other deficiencies, or that add or delete capability. Safety modifications correct deficiencies that produce hazards to personnel, systems, or equipment. This budget line covers both new and on-going modification efforts for space equipment and systems. Modification installation funding is budgeted in the year the installation occurs. 

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more effective. This agility must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through."

PE 1203160F Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (SPACE) - P-40A
PE 0305160F DEF METEOROLOGICAL SAT PROG (SPACE) 

The DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM (DMSP) is a fully operational program supporting a broad range of national security users who require timely and accurate global weather information. DMSP is DoD only assured source of global weather data providing visible and infrared cloud cover imagery (1/3 nautical miles (nm) constant resolution) and other meteorological, oceanographic, land surface, and space environmental data. DMSP satellites are flown in sun-synchronous, 450nm polar-orbits to meet mission requirements (sun-synchronous means the satellites cross the equator at the same local sun time on each of their 14 orbits/day). 
Key elements of the DMSP constellation command and control (C2) ground system have not been re-capitalized since the equipment was transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Satellite Operations in 1998. Critical C2 component spares have been depleted and parts cannibalization is no longer sustainable. Therefore, DMSP re-established an OPAF (now SPAF) funding line beginning in FY15 to enable continued C2 ground segment sustainment through a selective re-capitalization effort. C2 subsystems to be addressed include but are not limited to the Telemetry and Commanding System, Mission Planning and Scheduling System, and communications tracking station interface units. This selective re-capitalization effort is intended to ensure the DMSP C2 system remains viable through the planned DMSP mission fly-out no later than 2027.

PE 1203614F JSpOC Mission System - P-40A
PE 0305614F JSPOC MISSION SYSTEM 

JOINT SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) provides integrated space situational awareness information and C2 of space forces for the Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC-SPACE). It will allow JFCC-SPACE to plan, direct, coordinate, and control operations of assigned forces. The JMS provides a net-centric, Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) along with space mission applications to meet the needs above. It implements a Space User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to provide the capability to create, visualize, and share decision-relevant views of space operational environment at all echelons.

PE 1203873F Ballistic Missile Defense Radars - P-40A

COBRA DANE is the most powerful, sensitive, and accurate Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) radar and the premiere Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) radar. At the same time it is the most accurate and capable phased array available to the Space Surveillance Network (SSN) for cataloging hazardous and difficult-to-track satellites and space debris objects that clutter the near-earth orbital regime that cannot be detected by most other SSN tracking assets.  (U) COBRA DANE's primary mission is to support US Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM) Ballistic Missile Defense mission by providing midcourse coverage for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). COBRA DANE detects Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs), classifies reentry vehicles (RVs) and other missile objects, provides real-time information to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Fire Control (GFC), and provides tracking of threat ballistic missiles with sufficient accuracy to commit the launch of interceptors and to update the target tracks to the interceptor while the interceptor is in flight.  (U) COBRA DANE's corollary mission is to support USSTRATCOM's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by detecting, tracking, correlating, and characterizing man-made resident space objects, primarily in the Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) regime, including space debris and early observation of New Foreign Launches (NFL's). It operates as part of the larger Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and provides metric observation data to its command and control nodes: the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) and the Distributed Space Command and Control - Dahlgren (DSC2-D  (U) COBRA DANE also supports USSTRATCOM's Space Object Identification (SOI) mission by providing narrowband radar data of man-made resident space objects in the LEO regime. SOI information is used to ascertain the mission and operational status of various payloads and aids in forecasting maneuvers or deorbits. Cobra Dane mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly difficult to maintain on a 40 year old radar due to non-availability of replacement parts. Subsystems are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, transmitter groups, Traveling Wave Tubes, Time Delay units and all associated components and spares requires replacement. Due to the limited spares demand rates, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support this weapon system. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime.

PE 1203909F Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) - P-40A

The BALLISTIC MISSILE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (BMEWS) and the PAVE PHASED ARRAY WARNING SYSTEM (PAVE PAWS) are ground based radar systems with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance, and Missile Defense Centers. The radar systems provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area including Launch and Predicted Impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination. The radar systems also supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog as required by the Joint Space Operations Center, Alternate Space Operations Center, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center mitigating the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms.  The Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) site at Beale AFB also has a Missile Defense (MD) mission supporting the Missile Defense Agency.  The BMEWS and PAVE PAWS shares a common baseline and mission with the difference that BMEWS deploys more array elements on its radar faces. BMEWS radars are located at Thule Air Base, Greenland; Clear Air Force Station, AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, UK. PAVE PAWS radars are located at Beale AFB, CA and Cape Cod AFS, MA. Additionally there is a site for testing (System Program Agency) located in the Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) at Peterson AFB, CO. The BMEWS and PAVE PAWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, radar transmit &amp; receive components, processing equipment, and power distribution elements, and other radar front-end equipment are 30+ years old, highly inefficient, and require replacement. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair.

PE 1203160F DEF METEOROLOGICAL SAT PROG (SPACE) 

The DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM (DMSP) is a fully operational program supporting a broad range of national security users who require timely and accurate global weather information. DMSP is DoD only assured source of global weather data providing visible and infrared cloud cover imagery (1/3 nautical miles (nm) constant resolution) and other meteorological, oceanographic, land surface, and space environmental data. DMSP satellites are flown in sun-synchronous, 450nm polar-orbits to meet mission requirements (sun-synchronous means the satellites cross the equator at the same local sun time on each of their 14 orbits/day).
 
Key elements of the DMSP Command, Control, and Communication Ground System (DC3GS) have not been recapitalized since the equipment was transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Satellite Operations in 1998.  Critical DC3GS component spares have been depleted, parts cannibalized, and are no longer sustainable.  Therefore, DMSP re-established an OPAF (now SPAF) funding line beginning in FY15 to enable continued DC3GS sustainment through a selective re-capitalization effort.  DC3GS subsystems to be addressed include, but are not limited to the Link/2 Communication System, and Mission Planning and Scheduling System.  This selective re-capitalization effort is intended to ensure the DC3GS remains viable through the planned DMSP mission fly-out no later than 2027.

PE 1203165F NAVSTAR GPS (SPACE AND CONTROL SEGMENTS) 

NAVSTAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) provides highly accurate time and three dimensional position and velocity information to an unlimited number of users anywhere on or above the surface of the earth, in any weather. This system supplies highly accurate position, velocity, timing, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS) information to properly equipped air, land, sea, and space-based users worldwide. The GPS system consists of three segments: space, control, and user equipment. The Operational Control System (OCS) is part of the control segment and requires modifications to replace high failure rate parts and preclude system operational degradation. Without these mods, aging and obsolete equipment will excessively degrade, ultimately resulting in system failure. System failure or even partial system failure will cause a loss of operational availability and the transmission of inaccurate navigation data to worldwide users, resulting in potential loss of life and/or operational equipment, including multi-million dollar satellites. OCS is required to operate until the Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) transitions to operations, to include support for GPS III and fielding of Modernized GPS User Equipment (MGUE).

PE 1203614F JSPOC MISSION SYSTEM 

JOINT SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS) provides integrated space situational awareness information and C2 of space forces for the Joint Functional Component Commander for Space (JFCC-SPACE). It will allow JFCC-SPACE to plan, direct, coordinate, and control operations of assigned forces. The JMS provides a net-centric, Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) along with space mission applications to meet the needs above. It implements a Space User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to provide the capability to create, visualize, and share decision-relevant views of space operational environment at all echelons. 
PE 0305912F SLBM RADAR WARNING SYSTEM 

SEA-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE (SLBM) DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM: The primary mission of the 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System is to provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all SLBMs penetrating the coverage area. This data includes an estimation of launch and predicted impact (L&amp;PI) locations and times. The secondary mission is to provide the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, CO (CMAFS) and other users with ITW/AA data on Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area. Additionally, Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) and PAVE Phased Array Warning Systems (PAVE PAWS) support the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) mission by providing near earth satellite surveillance, tracking and identification as required by the Space Control Center, Alternate Space Control Center, and the Joint Intelligence Center. The sensors have an operational availability requirement of 98 percent. The 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System currently consists of: a) the AN/FPQ-16 PARCS and b) the AN/FPS-123 PAVE PAWS System (Phased Array Radars for SLBM Detection and Warning System). 

PE 123940F SPACE SITUATION AWARENESS OPERATIONS 

GROUND-BASED ELECTRO OPTICAL DEEP SPACE SURVEILLANCE (GEODSS) SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM (SLEP) Phase II: The GEODSS SLEP Phase II will replace aging unsupportable mission critical sub-systems with modern sustainable components, allowing continued mission operations through 2025. GEODSS is a three-site optical telescope system dedicated to the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The GEODSS sites, located in Socorro, New Mexico; Maui, Hawaii; and Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territories), provide time critical deep-space tracking information for the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). The GEODSS SLEP Phase II will modernize the Sensor Controller, Data Processing, and other unsustainable subsystems as required for all sites. The program will replace the obsolete, diminishing supportable components of the GEODSS Sensor Controller Group (SCG) with sustainable hardware/software technology.

PE 1203710F EO/IR WEATHER SYSTEMS

WEATHER SPACE VEHICLE RELAY GROUND STATION: Residual Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Relocation is a Department of Defense's (DoD) weather mitigation plan to address Space-based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Weather Gaps 1 (Cloud Characterization) and Gap 2 (Theater Weather Imagery) requirements over the Indian Ocean region.  The requirements have been validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo 092-14, dated 3 Sep 2014.  The program will leverage a spare National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) on-orbit geostationary asset for the DoD use, in order to provide timely and reliable high-quality electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) remote sensing capability that will address the critical weather data needs over the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AoR).</proc:Description>

                                        <proc:Description>Funding procures GPS Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP), GPS Information Network (GIN), and Launch Anomaly Resolution and Disposal Operations (LADO) commercial equipment that has become obsolete/unsupportable or requires upgrades. Funding will procure equipment for the OCS ground sites including the Master Control Station (MCS), Alternate Master Control Station (AMCS), four Ground Antennas (GAs), six Monitor Control Stations(MCS), Contractor Lab Facility and Telecommunications Simulator Test Set (TSTS). Modifications include required procurement, non-recurring engineering, installation, testing, configuration management, security, quality assurance and technical documentation. Funding sustains OCS until OCX transitions to operations, to include support for GPS III and fielding of Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE). If not funded, down time and maintenance costs associated with repair or failed equipment will increase, lowering system operational availability.

Milestone/Development Status

Development funding for the OCS is in PE 0305165F.  Program complete in FY2013.</proc:Description>

                                        <proc:Description>Residual Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Relocation is a Department of Defense (DoD) weather mitigation plan to address Space-Based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Weather Gap 1 (Cloud Characterization) and Gap 2 (Theater Weather Imagery) requirements over the Indian Ocean region.  The requirements have been validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo 092-14, dated 3 Sep 2014.  The program will leverage a spare National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) on-orbit geostationary asset for the DoD use, in order to provide timely and reliable high-quality Electro-Optical/infrared (EO/IR) remote sensing capability that will address the critical weather data needs over the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AoR).   

This is the DoD's solution to address SBEM Gaps 1 and 2 needs over the Indian Ocean region.  The Remote Station System (RGS) capability procurement is planned to include deployment, operation and sustainment of the RGS capability through the satellite mission End of Life (EoL), estimated 2025. 

The SBEM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), completed in Sep 2013, concluded that the Weather Gaps 1 and 2 can be met by increased reliance on civil/international partnerships for the necessary data.  With recent European announcement to de-commission/de-orbit MeteoSat-7 in FY17, DoD requires a replenishment geostationary EO/IR sensing capability to continue providing necessary weather data to warfighters in the CENTCOM AOR.  European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) has provided a short-term solution by relocating MeteoSat-8 for partial coverage of the Indian Ocean region, but its designed mission EoL is 2019.  For the long-term solution, with agreement from NOAA, the Air Force will take ownership of one or more residual GOES assets.  NOAA will drift the satellite(s) to a location over the Indian Ocean region to provide required cloud characterization and theater weather imagery data.  The Air Force will award a contract to establish, operate and maintain the remote ground infrastructure and use the existing NOAA Satellite Operational Facility (NSOF) at Suitland, MD for Command &amp; Control and anomaly resolution.  

Secondary investments may be supported to address weather gaps identified in the Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Initial Capability Document (ICD).

Ground infrastructure will include:
1) Procurement of 2x GOES antennae for data downlink at a Remote Ground Station (RGS) in the Indian Ocean region
2) Integration of GOES antennae into RGS and set up communication link to transmit data back to Weather Centrals for processing
3) Set up C2 ground station for daily Telemetry, Tracking &amp; Commanding (TT&amp;C) and proportionally reimburse NOAA for residual GOES operations during the drift planning and implementation phases.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more effective. This agility must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to speed decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through".</proc:Description>

                                        <proc:Description>The BALLISTIC MISSILE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (BMEWS) and the PAVE PHASED ARRAY WARNING SYSTEM (PAVE PAWS) are ground based radar systems with missions to support the Missile Correlation, Space Surveillance, and Missile Defense Centers. The radar systems provide United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) with credible Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) data on all Sea-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) penetrating the coverage area including Launch and Predicted Impact (L&amp;PI) data for attack assessment and response determination. The radar systems also supports the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) network providing near-earth satellite surveillance and tracking, reporting observational (metric), SOI on man-made satellites and maintenance of the space catalog as required by the Joint Space Operations Center, Alternate Space Operations Center, and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center mitigating the significantly increasing potential for collisions with national assets, including manned space platforms.  The Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) site at Beale AFB also has a Missile Defense (MD) mission supporting the Missile Defense Agency.  The BMEWS and PAVE PAWS shares a common baseline and mission with the difference that BMEWS deploys more array elements on its radar faces. BMEWS radars are located at Thule Air Base, Greenland; Clear Air Force Station, AK; and Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, UK. PAVE PAWS radars are located at Beale AFB, CA and Cape Cod AFS, MA. Additionally there is a site for testing (System Program Agency) located in the Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) at Peterson AFB, CO.
 The BMEWS and PAVE PAWS mission equipment and associated sustainment suites consist of a mix of unique, custom-built components that are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to availability of replacement parts and obsolete COTS based subsystems that are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturers. In addition, radar transmit &amp; receive components, processing equipment, and power distribution elements, and other radar front-end equipment are 30+ years old, highly inefficient, and require replacement. Without these replacements there is a high risk that equipment failures will cause unacceptable mission downtime in order to troubleshoot and repair.

This effort was formerly called BMEWS Block 02 Update and PAVE PAWS Block 02 Update and was formerly funded in 3080F/03/8 BPAC 838010 Comm Elect Mods. Starting in FY19 it will be combined and funded in 3021 Space Mod.

 FY19 will fund ongoing program management administrative costs supporting BMEWS/PAVE PAWS modification efforts and will fund replacement of unsupportable mission and support equipment and initial spares to include, but not limited to, solid state modules (SSMs) and associated components. Due to the limited spares demand rates, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support this weapon system.

                                        <proc:Description>This program, 1203912F SMS, P-3A Mod PARCSB1, PARCS Block 01, is a new start.
Formerly part of Space Mods Space mod BPAC 836790 in OPAF for FY15 and prior, appropriated in Space Procurement Air Force in FY16.  Perimeter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization System (PARCS) Program Office plans for and procures replacement components for unsupportable, unobtainable, and unreliable system components. PARCS equipment is composed of custom built components that became obsolete in the 1980s. Most spare parts for this system are no longer available and have no logistics tail. Without replacements there is a high risk of mission failure and/or unacceptable downtime for repair. To best ensure operational availability, replacement projects are performed in phases targeting the highest risk components of the subsystems.

In FY19, PE 1203912F, PARCS efforts were transferred to Appropriation 3021, Space Mods Space, BPAC SPCMOD; from Appropriation 3080, Comm Elect Mods, BPAC 838010. During FY18, PMA costs to initiate Block 01 were funded in Comm Elect Mods.

FY19 funds will be used to continue Block 01 by modifying the PARCS system for the replacement of unsupportable and unreliable components to include (with any required initial spares), but not limited to, the PARCS Mission Data Processor, Radar Transmitter, Antenna Group, Exciter Group, Radio Frequency Signal Processor Group, Performance Monitor Group, Radar Return Generator Group, Digital Data Group, and Radar Controller Group. Due to the limited spares demand rates, and indefinite system lifespan, Life of Type buys may be required to support this weapon system.  Additionally, FY19 will fund PMA costs associated with support of the Block 01 program and will fund PMA costs to initiate planning for Block 02.

                                <proc:Description>The Spacelift Range System (SLRS), also known as the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), provides public safety and assured access to space. LTRS operates at the Eastern Range (ER) at Patrick AFB/Cape Canaveral AFS, FL and the Western Range (WR) at Vandenberg AFB, CA. LTRS provides tracking, telemetry, communications, flight safety, and other capabilities to support launch of national security space (NSS), civil and commercial space payloads, Intercontinental and Sea Launched ballistic missile and missile defense evaluations, and aeronautical and guided weapon tests. LTRS enables national security, civil, and commercial spacelift operations to be conducted safely. Together with national security space launch capability, LTRS provides assured access to space for the nation. The ER and WR are designated as Department of Defense Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB). LTRS is comprised of twelve subsystems that together provide this capability to the ranges. The Range Safety and Command Destruct subsystems provide the capability to destroy an errant rocket, if necessary to protect public safety. These subsystems rely on the Telemetry, Radar, and Optics subsystems to provide tracking data. The Weather and Surveillance subsystems allow range operators and customers to determine if conditions are safe for launch. The Communications, Data Handling, and Timing &amp; Sequencing subsystems ensure critical data is expeditiously routed from remote sensors (e.g., radars, optics) to range operators and customers. Finally, the Planning and Scheduling subsystem ensures all assets are available when needed for a launch or test operation. The Air Force prioritizes procurement funds to ensure aging range equipment is modernized to support mission requirements. Sustainment trends are continuously analyzed and assessed across all twelve subsystems and procurement funds are used to modernize the most critical mission equipment and procure replacement components.

1) LTRS Interim Supply Support: Provides peculiar and common support material, required re-procurement data, and interim supply support management.

2) LTRS Support Services: FFRDC mission assurance activities ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches. Funds are also used for Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) to ensure baseline documentation and modernization activities remain synchronized with the sustainment baseline.

3) LTRS Commodity Procurement: The Air Force will use various contract vehicles to procure, configure, install and checkout replacement commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) commodity equipment to address the highest priority requirements. Obsolescence and sustainment "worst actors" in all twelve subsystems are prioritized annually in order of their criticality to the mission; priority is driven by likelihood of causing a launch delay/scrub.

4) Range Communications Facility (RCF): Relocate communications capabilities from the Eastern Range XY building to a new RCF, resolving building degradation, code non-compliance, and high risk off loading. The Air Force will either move existing equipment or procure new COTS equipment if necessary, to meet system requirements and minimize impacts to scheduled launches.

5) Range Command Destruct Modernization (RCDM): Modernizes the Eastern Range Command Destruct Systems. The Range Command Destruct modernization will provide the capability to
use a new secure Command Destruct code, the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS), mandated by the NSA for cyber security on the Eastern Range. The Eastern Range Command
Destruct system will replace a sustainment "worst actor" that has been the cause of an expensive launch scrub as well as several near scrubs. 

6) Modernization of Eastern Range Network (MEN): Upgrades the communications subsystem on the Eastern Range from outdated Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to Internet Protocol
(IP) version 4/6 (IPV4/IPV6). MEN resolves obsolescence issues facing the program starting in FY 2020, addresses high-priority sustainment issues, and provides improved cyber security for range operations. The contract was awarded as a small business set aside.

7) Western Range Modernization of Network (WMN): Upgrades the communications subsystem on Western Range from Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to an IPv6 based/IPv4 compatible network, resolving obsolescence issues, numerous high-priority sustainment issues, and providing improved cyber security for range operations. The WMN contract was awarded as a small business set aside.

The current and future space domain demands that space systems be responsive to new and changing threats, and can rapidly integrate new capabilities to make our warfighting force more resilient in a contested battlespace. This agility, survivability, and rapid reconstitution must extend through the entire space warfighting enterprise, to include how we learn about the threat; develop solutions; acquire, test, deploy, train, operate and integrate new systems into the greater system of systems; and ensure our space mission force is ready to defeat a thinking adversary in a complex, multi-domain battlespace. The enterprise will use all of its elements to accelerate decision-making, prototype potential solutions, rapidly integrate decision-making tools and sustain a war-winning capability by delivering multi-domain effects in, from, and through space and cyberspace enabling battle management and resilience options to "fight through." 

Recapitalization Projects are classified as commodity buys instead of modifications, because they do not change form, fit, function of a fielded system or subsystem.  Therefore, associated funding for these commodities is described on a P-5 exhibit.

The FY 2019 funding request was reduced by $14.872 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

Funding for this exhibit is contained in PE 1205182F.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>Spacelift Range System Space: For LTRS Interim Supply Support, FY 2019 funds will pay for interim supply support, to include supplies and associated interim supply support management. For LTRS SUPPORT SERVICES, FY 2019 funds pay for FFRDC mission assurance activities to ensure all twelve subsystems are compatible with mission rules and do not pose a risk to safe and cost-effective satellite launches. Funds are also used for Enterprise SE&amp;I to ensure baseline documentation and modernization activities remain synchronized with the sustainment baseline. LTRS Commodity Procurement (P40a) FY 2019 funds procure the most urgently needed capital equipment replacements for items that exceed the O&amp;M dollar threshold.

MEN, WMN, RCDM, and RCF (P-3As): FY 2019 funds for these modifications are required to enable the safe conduct of national security, civil, and commercial launches at the Eastern and Western Ranges. Further, they ensure continued support to test range customers.

FY 2019 funds will continue program office support and other related support activities.  Rapidly respond to implement system resiliency and situational awareness necessary to operate in the contested space domain.  These activities may include, but are not limited to studies, technical analysis, prototyping, etc.</proc:Justification>

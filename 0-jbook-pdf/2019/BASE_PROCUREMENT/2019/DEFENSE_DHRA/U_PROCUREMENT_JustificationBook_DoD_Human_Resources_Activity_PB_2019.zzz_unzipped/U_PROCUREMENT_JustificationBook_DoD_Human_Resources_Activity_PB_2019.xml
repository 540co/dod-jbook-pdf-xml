            <proc:Description>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a consolidated Field Activity under the direction and control of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (USD (P&amp;R)) established for the collection and interaction of manpower and personnel data to support Department-wide tracking, analysis, research, studies, and a wide variety of reporting requirements. DHRA provides functional information management, civilian personnel policy support, and civilian personnel administrative services to DoD Components and activities. The scope of operations is necessarily broad and encompasses all aspects of data collection and utilization of Defense manpower and personnel data records to support DoD-wide analysis, studies, research, and reporting requirements. DHRA is the responsible organization within DoD for the interchange of automated manpower data with other government agencies. 

In FY 2017, as a result of a Business Process and Systems Review, DHRA implemented a major reorganization impacting the DHRA procurement budget. The most significant aspect of this reorganization, from a procurement perspective, was the integration of the Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) into the Defense Manpower Data Center's (DMDC) portfolio of information technology (IT) initiatives. Additionally, DHRA implemented a major reorganization of the DMDC programs to more accurately align budget program lines with the DHRA Information Technology (IT) data reported in the DHRA IT Budget. The Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS); Data Governance/Data Acquisition &amp; Decision Support (EDS); Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS); Common Access Card (CAC); the Cyber Security program was integrated into the DEERS and RAPIDS programs, with CAC being retained as part of the RAPIDS program. Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) was integrated into a Personnel Accountability (PA) program, which also includes Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).

Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) includes the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), the Department's enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government's civilian work force.  Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single database and expansion of capabilities to support integrated benefits processing and data management supporting the Department's Force of the Future initiative.

Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS) is DoD's only authoritative data repository of all manpower, personnel (military, civilian, selected contractors, retirees, and family members), benefit eligibility, and TRICARE enrollments worldwide. Provides and maintains medical and personnel readiness information on Uniformed Services members, DoD and Medicare eligibility status, Federal Service member's Group Life Insurance enrollment, the central repository for immunizations, and the single portal for DoD benefit information. The program maintains enrollment and eligibility verification data from existing DEERS client applications and interfacing systems, as well as the DoD Components and non-DoD information systems.

RAPIDS is the infrastructure that supports the issuance of DoD and Uniformed Services identification cards and provides on-line updates to DEERS, thus providing an enterprise-wide credential for both physical and logical access to DoD facilities and networks. These DoD credentials use the DEERS database for authentication and personnel information.  RAPIDS is also the primary source for adding family members to DEERS, and it provides the seven Uniformed Services the means to verify eligibility for specific benefits and entitlements.

The PA program is comprised of several initiatives, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS). This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees. SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a "public" SIPR only application that provides daily person-level location reporting. JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail. NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.

The EDS program is comprised of 4 initiatives: Data Governance, Data Acquisition and Decision Support (DA&amp;DS), Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking Systems (FMTS), and Cyber.  Data Governance includes Enterprise Data assets, data modeling and database standardization, data quality, and database architectures. Master Data Management oversight controls costs while providing timely and accurate information to the DoD decision makers. Data Acquisition and Decision Support (DA&amp;DS) is a collection of critical data sources for the Department of Defense that are managed and updated in real time while enforcing data standardization and data quality. FMTS is the authoritative source for DoD 4th Estate manpower authorizations, identity management, authentication and enterprise email. Cyber is related directly to the development of the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment to serve as an immediate deterrent to allow/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Project: EHRIS.  FY 2019 investment enables continued Enterprise Human Resources Information Systems (EHRIS) consolidation, rationalization and modernization efforts.  This includes the procurement of ORACLE EBS licenses, cyber security monitoring and testing tools, supporting talent management and payroll and their integration within the enterprise personnel data system solution, DCPDS.  Consolidation of these efforts is critical as network maturation and emphasis on cyber-hardening activities as well as FIAR compliance continue to be the focal point against cyber warfare and for the ability to produce auditable financial statements.  Rationalization and Modernization of legacy systems as well as standalone systems includes the Priority Placement Program and Reemployment Priority List and enhancing Talent Management and Competency Assessment Management.

Project: DEERS. FY 2019 investment in DEERS will be used to procure the hardware and software necessary to consolidate data repositories and implement common access services.  This enhancement greatly improves DMDC's insider threat posture and matures data cyber security capabilities while providing consistent and auditable application security infrastructure. In addition, FY 2019 investment will be used to procure infrastructure for MilConnect to expand secure self-service capabilities for DoD beneficiaries to increase our service members' ability to access the right data at the right time.  Emphasis will be on enabling use of personal communication devices such as smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices which play an ever-increasing role in the lives of DoD beneficiaries.  

Project: RAPIDS/CAC.  FY 2019 investment in Automated Data Processing (ADP) equipment includes the acquisition of the DMDC RAPIDS/CAC infrastructure, allowing the replacement of out-dated and/or maintenance-intensive equipment in order to continue to ensure full functionality, system security, and HSPD-12 compliance of the RAPIDS/CAC system.

Project: PA. FY 2019 investment in the NEO Tracking System (NTS) will be used to upgrade fielded NTS across the COCOMs and the National Guard as called for in Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 117-10 dated 29 JUL 2010. This centralized procurement of equipment will enable DMDC to track the systems in the field and provide support such as software upgrades, training and equipment tracking which are also responsibilities of DMDC called out in JROCM 117-10.  Upgraded equipment will provide the COCOMs with more manageable and reliable systems.  

Other PA programs such as SPOT-ES will receive upgraded equipment that decreases the footprint and meets the requirement of reducing redundant IT services across the Department.  SPOT-ES will also increase their global presence through improved guidance at the COCOMs and additional hardware will be required to support the use of JAMMS in the SPOT-ES program. 

FY 2019 investment in the JPARR will allow for continued expansion. This investment will allow for the acquisition of hardware and software needed to include the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) into JPARR. USNORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM will be the fifth and sixth Combatant Commands supported by these reports. Investments will also be made to modernize the applications and improve reporting capabilities. 

Project: EDS. FY 2019 investment will be used to procure hardware, software, architecture, communications, and storage to extend and enhance the proven Person-event Data Environment (PDE) research and analysis capability to all of the Department of Defense. PDE is a cloud computing, self- service environment where researchers set up their approved studies, invite colleagues to participate, review 'like' analyses and use a common electronic Institutional Review Board (eIRB) to protect the exposure of individuals used in a study. Additionally, the use of the PDE is a proactive step to greatly reduce the risk to DoD of a potentially massive Personally Identifying Information (PII) data loss. Enhancing the PDE will provide an integrated solution which 1) reduces costs, 2) leverages self-service and collaboration, 3) encourages data sharing through a standard data catalog and streamlined business workflow, 4) protects data under the Privacy Act and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, and 5) provides the security for unencumbered access.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides for procurement of AN/SPQ-9B Radars whose primary mission is to detect and track low flying Anti-Ship Missile targets in heavy clutter.  The mission of the AN/SPQ-9B has been expanded to include the capability to detect and classify periscopes. The Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) capability has been designed and incorporated to operate concurrently with the Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) capability.

[BR5IN AN/SPQ-9B FMP INSTALLATIONS]: Provided funding to install AN/SPQ-9B Radar systems.  AN/SPQ-9B systems are installed using Alteration Installation Teams (AITs) that require Planning Yard Design Services Allocation (DSA) funds one (1) and two (2) years prior to installation.  Advanced Planning (AP) is required one (1) year prior to installation.

[BR6IN AN/SPQ-9B NON FMP INSTALLATIONS]: Provided funding for the installation of equipment for Land Based Test Sites (LBTS).

[P40A / BR040 TRANSMITTER UPGRADE FMP]: Funding was provided for installations of AN/SPQ-9B Transmitter Upgrades on LPD-17.

[P40A / BR040 TRANSMITTER UPGRADE NON-FMP EQUIPMENT]: Funding provided for Transmitter Upgrade Processor installations at Surface Warfare Engineering Facility (SWEF) and Combat Systems Engineering Development Site (CSEDS) (both non-FMP).

[P40A / BR042 AN/SPQ-9B ENGINEERING CHANGE PROPOSALS (ECP)]: Procures product improvements generated by Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs); corrects problems reported by Fleet units; upgrades unreliable components and replaces obsolete components and parts no longer in production for AN/SPQ-9B Radar; and addresses supportability concerns.  Purchases and installs ECPs, including Antenna Shock Upgrade Kits, Antenna Radar Components, Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Kits, Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) Kits and engineering change kit hardware components.  Antenna Shock Upgrade Kits are installed during Antenna Restorations.  DSP and PDD kits are installed conjunctively via Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and can be accomplished outside of a CNO Availability.

[P40A / BR830 AN/SPQ-9B PRODUCTION SUPPORT]: Provides support for production of hardware and hardware components and is composed primarily of Warfare Center Activity support, Software Support Activity (SSA), Integrated Logistics Agent (ILA), Acquisition Engineering Agent (AEA), Technical Design Agent (TDA) and Professional Support Services (PSS). Also includes support for cybersecurity compliance and software certification.

[P3A / BR040 AN/SPQ-9B RADAR FMP EQUIPMENT]: Procures AN/SPQ-9B Radars to add Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) capability to Shipboard Combat Systems. Procures radars to support combat systems on the following ship classes: CG, LHA, DDG, CVN, LHD, LPD, U.S. Coast Guard National Security Cutter and a Training Unit. Systems procured for Cruisers/Destroyers (CRUDES) and Amphibious Ships in FY14 and beyond will also include the Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) capability.</proc:Description>

                                                <proc:Name footnote="1) The follow-on contract was awarded in December 2015.  This contract includes a total of twelve (12) FY14, FY15 and FY16 funded SPQ-9B radars being procured across several appropriations (OPN, SCN, FMS).  The first radar will be delivered 22 months after award.  All follow-on radars will be delivered at a rate of one every other month. Due to delayed contract award, the unit procured with FY14 funds will replace a system previously procured under Cruiser Modernization for CG61 which was diverted to meet the installation schedule requirements for LHD 2 in FY16. The installation on LHD 2 was fully funded in FY14.  2) The FY18 installations on the DDG 79, DDG 80 and LHD 6 were forward funded with surplus  FY15 installation funds for Design Services Allocation (DSA)/Advance Planning (AP), and therefore no FY16 installation funds are required.  3) SPQ-9B was moved from BLI 5110 to BLI 2026 in FY2004.  Prior to 2004, the procurement of the first five (5) AN/SPQ-9B systems was funded under the Mk 86 program under BLI 5110. The installation costs for four (4) out of five (5) of these installs were included in the 2026 budget.  This explains the difference of 81 installations and only 77 procurements in this budget (delta 4).    4) Due to the shipyard requirement to fully fund the DDG 84 installation prior to start of the availability in January 2019, funding for the installation of the FY17 radar on DDG 84 is in FY19 despite the planned radar delivery of November 2019.  The DDG 84 availability starts in January 2019 and ends in April 2020.">1.1.1) BR040 AN/SPQ-9B RADAR FMP EQUIPMENT - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>[BR040 AN/SPQ-9B RADAR FMP EQUIPMENT] Procures AN/SPQ-9B Radars to add Anti-Ship Missile Defense (ASMD) capability to Shipboard Combat Systems. Procures radars to support combat systems on the following ship classes: CG, LHA, DDG, CVN, LHD, LPD, U.S. Coast Guard National Security Cutter and a Training Unit. Systems procured for Cruisers/Destroyer(CRUDES) and Amphibious Ships in FY14 and beyond will also include the Periscope Detection and Discrimination (PDD) capability. 

Notes: BR040 AN/SPQ-9B RADAR FMP EQUIPMENT:

1) The follow-on contract was awarded in December 2015.  This contract includes a total of twelve (12) FY14, FY15 and FY16 funded SPQ-9B radars being procured across several appropriations (OPN, SCN, FMS).  The first radar will be delivered 22 months after award.  All follow-on radars will be delivered at a rate of one every other month. Due to delayed contract award, the unit procured with FY14 funds will replace a system previously procured under Cruiser Modernization for CG61 which was diverted to meet the installation schedule requirements for LHD 2 in FY16. The installation on LHD 2 was fully funded in FY14. 

2) The FY18 installations on the DDG 79, DDG 80 and LHD 6 were forward funded with surplus  FY15 installation funds for Design Services Allocation (DSA)/Advance Planning (AP), and therefore no FY16 installation funds are required.

3) SPQ-9B was moved from BLI 5110 to BLI 2026 in FY2004.  Prior to 2004, the procurement of the first five (5) AN/SPQ-9B systems was funded under the Mk 86 program under BLI 5110. The installation costs for four (4) out of five (5) of these installs were included in the 2026 budget.  This explains the difference of 81 installations and only 77 procurements in this budget (delta 4).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) remains a Navy core competency in a dynamic and uncertain maritime environment.  U.S. adversaries continue to develop asymmetric capabilities and capacities to deter, disrupt, or delay the entry of U.S. and allied naval forces, and pose a constant challenge as the Maritime Strategy is implemented.  Evolving submarine technologies offer enhanced stealth, speed, endurance, weapons, and operational proficiency, trends foretelling that the adversary submarine of the future will have a significantly larger sphere of influence, while presenting less vulnerability to ASW forces.  The effective offensive engagement range of the adversary submarine of the future will continue to match or outrange individual U.S. and multinational platform sensors and weapons in many tactical environments.  Submarines are an increasing threat to all Naval and Allied ships, particularly modern diesel subs and faster torpedoes.  Not only can the presence of potential hostile submarines delay naval combatant action until they are located and neutralized, submarines can also disrupt all seaborne logistics supply for any ground campaign as well as maritime commerce.  ASW forces must be effective in all operating environments, ranging from the deep open ocean to the littorals, and are key to countering adversarial anti-access and area denial strategies.

The AN/SQQ-89(V) Surface Ship ASW Combat System provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) combat management, fire control, command and control, and on-board training to enable surface combatants to engage USW targets in both open ocean and littoral environments.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a system comprised of many subsystems, which integrate the helo and its sensors, the ship's own organic sensors, weapons, torpedo detection, and a high fidelity Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  Variants of the AN/SQQ-89(V) are currently in operation on practically all in-service CG47 and DDG51 Class Surface Combatants.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship USW Combat System Upgrade - Detailed Description:
A major upgrade to the AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy system, the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade significantly decreases ship vulnerability to torpedo attack, improves surface ship USW shallow water warfighting capability in the littoral, and mitigates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence and supportability issues.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade was reported as a critical need for surface ASW operations by SECNAV.  A Fleet Forces Command (FFC) Urgent Operational Needs (UON) report identified the Fleet need for AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrades.  The need for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is also articulated in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Integrated Priorities List (IPL); in Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) 'Surface ASW Capabilities Build' funding priorities letters; in a 7th Fleet Bottom Up review report; and in the U.S. Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) ASW Integrated Prioritized Capabilities List (IPCL).

The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade is programmed for backfit on: Select CG47 Class Baseline 3 and 4 (CG59-73) ships via OP,N BLI 0960 (Cruiser Modernization); DDG51 Class Flight I/II (DDG51-78) ships via OP,N BLI 0900 (DDG Modernization) and OP,N BLI 2136 (represented here); and DDG51 Class Flight IIA and follow (DDG79+) ships via OP,N BLI 2136 (represented here).

The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade, developed under RDT&amp;E,N PE 0205620N, capitalizes on previously fielded AN/SQQ-89(V)15 systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is comprised of a tactical towed array sensor, the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA), and will replace standard, militarized, legacy components with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware to provide an ASW combat system with the capability for mid-frequency bistatic and multi-static sonar operations.  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 features a mid-frequency bistatic hull/towed Sonar Echo Tracker Classifier (ETC); hull/towed Sonar with Acoustic Intercept (ACI) fused data for significantly improved torpedo defense; Handling &amp; Stowage Group (H&amp;SG) for MFTA operation; Torpedo Setting Panel (TSP); passive towed array processing; common sub/surface sensor performance and prediction; common NAVAIR/Surface Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) processing; portable software; integrated supportability; and on-board training via the Surface ASW Synthetic Trainer (SAST).  The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 will be interoperable with AEGIS Weapons System (AWS) baselines; is Open Architecture (OA) compliant (meeting OA Level 3 requirements); provides significant reductions in weight, space, cooling, and power requirements over legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) systems; is Grade A shock qualified; supports Digital Fire Control Integration (DFCI) capability; and is integrated with the Battle Force Tactical Trainer (BFTT).

Additionally, to be effective against increasingly stealthy threats in an often ambiguous undersea environment, future sensors must be environmentally adaptive, have very low false alarm rates, and exploit the full range of current and future submarine detection vulnerabilities.  Via the Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process under RDT&amp;E,N PE 0205620N (ACB-13, ACB-15, ACB-17, etc.), these types of maturing/proven USW technologies will be folded into the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production and future technology refresh programs (fielded starting in FY 2016).  Leveraging the submarine community's Acoustic Rapid Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) process, the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Tech Refresh program procures upgraded software/hardware technology for all CG47/DDG51 Class surface combatant platforms with a previously fielded AN/SQQ-89A(V)15.  This process has proven to manage obsolescence, take advantage of commercial development efforts, and continue to pace the threat to ensure systems remain effective well into the 21st century.  Studies of the submarine and surface ASW technology show that system upgrades are most critical 6-9 years after initial installation of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15, as failure rates within this period begin to rise.  Establishing a stable technology refresh program will ensure the Fleet maintains critical Undersea Warfare capability (threat-pacing improvements) and productivity (Increased Operational Availability (Ao)) while reducing the Total Ownership Cost (TOC) to the Navy.

YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING PROFILE FROM PROCUREMENT TO INSTALL:
1st Year - Procurement of Equipment
2nd Year - Ordering of incidental installation material and perform mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks
3rd Year - Installation of Equipment

The majority of AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 shipset, shore site, and trainer equipment is procured via the prime vendor (currently Lockheed Martin based out of NY and VA, with subcontract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC), based out of NY and PA), while other Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE), such as the MFTA, OK-410 H&amp;SG, SAST, Static Automated Bus Transfer System (SABTS), TSP, Calibrated Reference Hydrophone (CRH) Junction Box, Portable Towed Array Test Set (PTATS), On Board Repair Parts (OBRPs), Maintenance Assist Modules (MAMS), Installation Checkout (INCO) Spares, and Special Tools and Test Equipment (STTE), is procured via other, separate, contract/funding vehicles.

An average, aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 shipset unit cost is indicated on the applicable budget exhibits, however, it should be noted that this unit cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles as mentioned above.  Additionally, the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary as they are dependent on the pre-existing legacy AN/SQQ-89(V) configuration of each ship.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is preferably no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date, and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements, and based on ship availabilities.  Fleet availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.

FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.

Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is preferably no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements, and based on ship availabilities, as identified in the Fleet Modernization Program Management Information System (FMPMIS).  Significant maintenance availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.  Note: FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.">1.1.1) AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG79-112 FLT IIA UPGRADE - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING PROFILE FROM PROCUREMENT TO INSTALL:
1st Year - Procurement of Equipment
2nd Year - Ordering of incidental installation material and perform mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks.  This is shown as a quantity of "0" with requested funds in the year before the installation of equipment.
3rd Year - Installation of Equipment

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG79-112 FLT IIA UPGRADE - COST CODE DB400 PROCUREMENT: Procurement of AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 equipment for subsequent backfit installation on all DDG79-112 Flight IIA ships.  An average, aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 unit cost is indicated, however, it should be noted that this cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles.  Additionally, the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary as they are dependent on the pre-existing configuration of each ship.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG79-112 FLT IIA UPGRADE - COST CODE DB6IN INSTALLATION: Funding is for the full-up physical installation of the major AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade, the ordering of incidental installation material in the year prior to the actual installation, and Design Services Allocation (DSA) required for mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks that must be completed within the one year period leading up to the actual installation in the shipyard.

Note: FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.

The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 requires a CNO (Chief of Naval Operations) availability period.  The installation is accomplished by Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and shipyard personnel together.  The AIT personnel are responsible for the removal of all AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy equipment, addition and modification of foundations, and installation, connectorization, and test of all new AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 equipment.  The shipyard personnel are responsible for all rigging activities, hull access cuts, and installation of the Handling &amp; Stowage Gear (H&amp;SG) on non-tailed (i.e. no towed array) DDG51 Class Flight IIA hulls, which is required for the operation of the tactical towed sonar, the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA).

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is preferably no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements, and based on ship availabilities, as identified in the Fleet Modernization Program Management Information System (FMPMIS).  Significant maintenance availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.</proc:Description>

Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is preferably no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements, and based on ship availabilities, as identified in the Fleet Modernization Program Management Information System (FMPMIS).  Significant maintenance availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.  Note: FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.">1.1.1) AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG51-78 (SELECT) FLT I/II UPGRADE - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>[AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG51-78 (SELECT) FLT I/II UPGRADE] See the following:

YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING PROFILE FROM PROCUREMENT TO INSTALL:
1st Year - Procurement of Equipment
2nd Year - Ordering of incidental installation material and perform mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks. This is shown as a quantity of "0" with requested funds in the year before the installation of equipment.
3rd Year - Installation of Equipment

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG51-78 (SELECT) FLT I/II UPGRADE - COST CODE DB400 PROCUREMENT: Procurement of AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 equipment for subsequent backfit installation on select DDG51-78 FLT I/II ships.  An average, aggregate AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 unit cost is indicated, however, it should be noted that this cost is comprised of multiple contract/funding vehicles.  Additionally, the subdivision of these unit costs to a specific ship can vary as they are dependent on the pre-existing configuration of each ship.  NOTE: Procurement of an AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 for DDG51 Class FLT I/II ships does not require the OK-410 Handling &amp; Stowage Group (H&amp;SG) subsystem as needed with DDG51 Class FLT IIA ships.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG51-78 (SELECT) FLT I/II UPGRADE - COST CODE DB6IN INSTALLATION: Funding is for the full-up physical installation of the major AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 upgrade, the ordering of incidental installation material in the year prior to the actual installation, and Design Services Allocation (DSA) required for mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks that must be completed within the one year period leading up to the actual installation in the shipyard.

Note: FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.

The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 requires a CNO (Chief of Naval Operations) availability period.  The installation is accomplished by Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and shipyard personnel together.  The AIT personnel are responsible for the removal of all AN/SQQ-89(V) legacy equipment, addition and modification of foundations, and installation, connectorization, and test of all new AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 equipment.  The shipyard personnel are responsible for all rigging activities and hull access cuts.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production shipset delivery time is 18 months after contract award.  Each subsequent system procured in an FY is delivered one month later than the previous system.  Delivery of equipment to the shipyard is preferably no later than 30-90 days prior to a CONUS (Continental U.S.) installation start date and no later than 120 days prior to a non-CONUS installation start date.  Installations are assigned to specific ships as per Fleet priorities/requirements, and based on ship availabilities, as identified in the Fleet Modernization Program Management Information System (FMPMIS).  Significant maintenance availability periods to support a major upgrade such as the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 normally occur only once every two years in a ship's schedule.</proc:Description>

YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING PROFILE FROM PROCUREMENT TO INSTALL:
1st Year - Procurement of Equipment
2nd Year - Ordering of incidental installation material and perform mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks. This is shown as a quantity of "0" with requested funds in the year before the installation of equipment.
3rd Year - Installation of Equipment

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG113 AND FOLLOW MFTA/HANDLER UPGRADE - COST CODE DB400 PROCUREMENT: Procurement of a subset of AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 equipment, specifically the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) and Handling &amp; Stowage Group (H&amp;SG), for subsequent installation on all DDG113 and follow ships during their Post Delivery Availability (PDA) or Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) periods, to upgrade the ASW sonar suite from an AN/SQQ-89(V)15 configuration to the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 configuration.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - DDG113 AND FOLLOW MFTA/HANDLER UPGRADE - COST CODE DB6IN INSTALLATION: Physical installation of the H&amp;SG and MFTA on DDG113 and follow ships during their PDA or PSA period which includes the installation of an egress, under-deck stiffeners, cables, bulkheads, opening and closing of the transom, the winch, levelwind, fairlead and control station, decking, painting, and final system testing, the ordering of incidental installation material in the year prior to the actual installation, and Design Services Allocation (DSA) required for mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks that must be completed within the one year period leading up to the actual installation in the shipyard.

Note: FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.</proc:Description>

YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING PROFILE FROM PROCUREMENT TO INSTALL:
1st Year - Procurement of Equipment
2nd Year - Ordering of incidental installation material and perform mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks. This is shown as a quantity of "0" with requested funds in the year before the installation of equipment.
3rd Year - Installation of Equipment

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - TECHNOLOGY INSERTION/REFRESH - COST CODE DB400 PROCUREMENT: Leveraging the submarine community's Acoustic Rapid Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) process, the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Tech Refresh program procures upgraded software/hardware technology for all CG47/DDG51 Class surface combatant platforms with a previously fielded AN/SQQ-89A(V)15.  This process has proven to manage obsolescence, take advantage of commercial development efforts, and continue to pace the threat to ensure systems remain effective well into the 21st century.  Studies of the submarine and surface ASW technology show that system upgrades are most critical 6-9 years after initial installation of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15, as failure rates within this period begin to rise.  Establishing a stable technology refresh program will ensure the Fleet maintains critical Undersea Warfare capability (threat-pacing improvements) and productivity (Increased Operational Availability (Ao)) while reducing the Total Ownership Cost (TOC) to the Navy.

AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 - TECHNOLOGY INSERTION/REFRESH - COST CODE DB6IN INSTALLATION: Funding is for the physical installation of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Technology Refresh upgrade, the ordering of incidental installation material in the year prior to the actual installation, and Design Services Allocation (DSA) required for mandatory planning yard design tasks and ship checks that must be completed within the one year period leading up to the actual installation in the shipyard.

Note 1:  FY 2018 and follow AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 installation unit cost increases since the President's Budget 2017 submit reflect projections for when the shipyards transition from Multi-Ship/Multi-Option (MS/MO) to a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contracting strategy, as directed by the Fleet Forces Command Naval Message, dated March FY 2016.

Note 2:  AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Technology Insertion/Refresh shipset buys were reduced by 1 in FY 2018 and 2 in FY 2019, in order for the program to fund a major Engineering Change (EC) to the Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA), which is critically required to address and resolve deficiencies in the current MFTA TB-37 version's reliability (by changing from a Towed Array Integrated Product Team (TAIPT) telemetry to a more reliable telemetry), as well as address and resolve parts obsolescence issues.</proc:Description>

A.  MISSION DESCRIPTION AND BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION:   This program procures submarine systems and equipment for installation on all classes of submarines to maintain clear acoustical, tactical, and operational superiority over submarine and surface combatants in all scenarios through detection, classification, localization, and contact following.  All future acoustic upgrades of Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) equipment are incorporated into this budget item.  Future procurements, detailed below, are focused on supporting Littoral Warfare, Regional Sea Denial, Strike Group Support, Diesel Submarine Detection, Surveillance, and Peacetime Engagement.  A-RCI is a multi-phased, evolutionary development effort geared toward addressing acoustic superiority issues through the rapid introduction of interim products applicable to SSN 688, 688I Flight, SSN21, SSGN, VA Class, and SSBN 726 Class Submarines.  A-RCI Phase II provided towed array processing improvements; A-RCI Phase III provides spherical array processing improvements, and A-RCI Phase IV provides AN/BSY-1 High Frequency Upgrades for SSN 688I, SSGN, and Seawolf Classes.  As part of Navy's plan to maintain acoustic superiority for in-service submarines, reduce obsolescence, and provide increased capability, the A-RCI program will modernize and sustain approximately 8-12 SSNs and 2-3 SSBNs per year through executing bi-annual software Advanced Processing Builds (APBs) and bi-annual hardware Technical Insertions (TIs).   

Towed system procurements of TB-29X and  TB-34X provide reliability improvements to maintain acoustic superiority, increase the service life, reduce failures, and maintain the inventory of arrays available for fleet use.  Towed Array Refurbishment &amp; Reliability Upgrades sustain current in-service TB-16/34 fat line and TB-23/29A thin line towed arrays.  Towed System procurements provide upgrade/support for OK-276, OK-634, OK-542 and OA-9070 Series Towed Array Handlers installed on SSN688, SSN 688I, SSN21, SSGN, VA Class, and SSBN 726 Class Submarines. 

Procurement of Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) provides enhanced situational awareness and collision avoidance capability in high contact density environments experienced in the littorals.  Procurement of VA Unique Sensors sustains unique hull sensor systems for the VA platforms under the Critical Transducer Program as VA Class submarines transition into fleet service.

Installation funds are for actual hardware installations during shipyard and pier-side availabilities.  Procurements support a 12-15 month lead time for installations.

[P40A / SA102 TOWED SYSTEMS]: Procures TB-34X Fatline and TB-29X Thinline Arrays to provide increase acoustic capability and reliability to the fleet.  The program supports N8's response to the Fleet Forces Command's Urgent Operational Needs Statement message (dated 15 June 2009) which requests that a reliable Thinline Towed Array is critically needed to support submarine operations in the Western Pacific Area of Operations, refurbishment/upgrades reliability improvements to TB-16 series, TB-23, TB-29A to maintain in-service Towed Array inventory and increased array availability.  Reliability improvements include new telemetry, hose material, improved internal connectors, hydrophones, tow cables, and Vibration Isolation Modules (VIMS), and Heading Sensors.

[P40A / SA105 SONAR SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: Funds provided to procure BQN-17(A) and associated equipment.

[P40A / SA106 HULL SENSORS]: Procurement of Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) provides enhanced situational awareness and collision avoidance capability, and VA Unique Sensors required to sustain unique hull sensor systems for the VA platforms under the Critical Transducer Program.

[P40A / SA201 BLOCK CHANGES]: Minor Engineering Change Proposals (ECP's) and hardware changes affecting all classes of submarines are procured through this line.  Funding will be used to support non-recurring first article test efforts associated with the changing COTS environment as well as Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability modifications requested by the Fleet.  This line also supports the procurement of hardware necessary to implement the ECP's into the System or end item being procured.

[P40A / SA202 PRODUCTION/ENGINEERING SUPPORT]: Funding supports the procurement of Acoustics Upgrades equipment and Towed System hardware.

[P40A / SA203 TOWED ARRAY UNIQUE TEST EQUIPMENT]: Funding procures various towed array test equipment simulators and handling system/stowage tube inspection test equipment.

[P40A / SA302 OP TRAINER UPGRADES]: Funding procures hardware upgrades and production engineering for Acoustic Upgrades operational trainer sites.

[P40A / SA303 COTS SUPPORTABILITY UPGRADES]: Provides for Technology Refresh/Insertion for A-RCI kits.  Tech Refresh provides for Software and Hardware updates to accommodate shifts in technology to the execution procurement years' "current state-of-the-practice" hardware. A-RCI has already undergone several technology insertion phases to accommodate integrating Advanced Processing Builds (APBs). Updates are necessary for signal and display processing hardware as APBs are introduced or as commercial support for the hardware is phased out.  Tech Insertion procures the hardware necessary to upgrade and back fit the A-RCI kits.  When A-RCI systems are being upgraded to subsequent phases of A-RCI, signal processing and display hardware will be procured from this line to accommodate common technology consistent with the APB being implemented in the year of introduction.  In future years, requirements include additional equipment in technology insertion to prevent COTS hardware from becoming unsupportable/obsolete.  Funding also supports the procurement and engineering for COTS Underwater Comms.

[P40A / SA401 INITIAL TRAINING]: Provides for initial training curriculum development, training management materials, exercise control group development, pilot services, and services to the Fleet.

[P40A / SA900 CONSULTING SERVICES]: Includes specification validation, contract deliverable monitoring, prime contractor monitoring for cost, schedule, and performance slips, ILS planning, and coordination of GFI.  Additional support will include production planning, business case analysis, technical refresh and insertion planning and market analysis to review implementation strategies for procurement of current year "state of the practice" hardware in Acoustics programs.  Consulting services will also provide production monitoring, installation planning and coordination support.</proc:Description>

A-RCI is a multi-phased, evolutionary development effort geared toward addressing acoustic superiority issues through the rapid introduction of interim products applicable to SSN 688, 688I Flight, SSN21, SSGN, VA Class, and SSBN 726 Class Submarines.  A-RCI Phase II provided towed array processing improvements; A-RCI Phase III provides spherical array processing improvements, and A-RCI Phase IV provides AN/BSY-1 High Frequency Upgrades for SSN 688I, SSGN, and Seawolf Classes.  As part of Navy's plan to maintain acoustic superiority for in-service submarines, reduce obsolescence, and provide increased capability, the A-RCI program will modernize and sustain approximately 8-12 SSNs and 2-3 SSBNs per year through executing bi-annual software Advanced Processing Builds (APBs) and bi-annual hardware Technical Insertions (TIs).   

Towed system procurements of TB-29X and TB-34X provide reliability improvements to maintain acoustic superiority, increase the service life, reduce failures, and maintain the inventory of arrays available for fleet use.  Towed Array Refurbishment &amp; Reliability Upgrades sustain current in-service TB-16/34 fat line and TB-23/29A thin line towed arrays.  Towed System procurements provide upgrade/support for OK-276, OK-634, OK-542 and OA-9070 Series Towed Array Handlers installed on SSN688, SSN 688I, SSN21, SSGN, VA Class, and SSBN 726 Class Submarines. 

Procurement of Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) provides enhanced situational awareness and collision avoidance capability in high contact density environments experienced in the littorals.  Procurement of VA Unique Sensors sustains unique hull sensor systems for the VA platforms under the Critical Transducer Program as VA Class submarines transition into fleet service.

Procurement of the OHIO Class Large Vertical Array (LVA) provides improved detection and enhanced tactical situational awareness capability for tracking targets of interest, and supports acoustic superiority objectives for the OHIO class submarines.  SSBN systems will be approximately half the width of their SSN counterparts.  This variance reflects the difference in mission, expected environment, and requirements.

Procurement of the VIRGINIA Class Large Vertical Array (LVA) provides improved detection and enhanced tactical situational awareness capability for tracking targets of interest, and supports acoustic superiority objectives for the VIRGINIA class submarines.  SSN systems will be approximately twice the width of their SSBN counterparts.  This variance reflects the difference in mission, expected environment, and requirements.

Procurement of the High Frequency Sail Array (HFSA) provides high frequency active and passive capability supporting ASW and ASUW for SSNs, and contact avoidance for SSNs and SSBNs.  This capability enables close in situational awareness with high bearing accuracy.  HFSA improves situational awareness and tactical control in high density contact areas, of particular importance for Pacific Fleet SSBNs based at Bangor WA inside the Puget Sound with three major commercial shipping ports.

Procurement of hydrophones, transducers, cables, associated Out-Board Electronics bottles (OBE), and acoustic windows for In-Service Undersea Warfare Sonars on all classes of submarines are required to support units in the fleet on a replacement basis, at regularly scheduled ship overhauls, and at interim availabilities when units are defective, and for upgrades.

Installation funds are for actual hardware installations during shipyard and pier-side availabilities.  Procurements support a 12-24 month lead time for installations.

[P40A / SA102 TOWED SYSTEMS]: Procures TB-34X Fatline and TB-29X Thinline Arrays to provide increase acoustic capability and reliability to the fleet.  The program supports N8's response to the Fleet Forces Command's Urgent Operational Needs Statement message (dated 15 June 2009) which requests that a reliable Thinline Towed Array is critically needed to support submarine operations in the Western Pacific Area of Operations, refurbishment/upgrades reliability improvements to TB-16 series, TB-23, TB-29A to maintain in-service Towed Array inventory and increased array availability.  Reliability improvements include new telemetry, hose material, improved internal connectors, hydrophones, tow cables, Vibration Isolation Modules (VIMS), and Heading Sensors.

[P40A / SA105 SONAR SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: Funds provided to procure BQN-17(A) and associated equipment.

[P40A / SA106 HULL SENSORS]: Procurement of Low Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) provides enhanced situational awareness and collision avoidance capability, and VA Unique Sensors required to sustain unique hull sensor systems for the VA platforms under the Critical Transducer Program.

[P40A / SA201 BLOCK CHANGES]: Minor Engineering Change Proposals (ECP's) and hardware changes affecting all classes of submarines are procured through this line.  Funding will be used to support non-recurring first article test efforts associated with the changing COTS environment as well as Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability modifications requested by the Fleet.  This line also supports the procurement of hardware necessary to implement the ECP's into the System or end item being procured.

[P40A / SA202 PRODUCTION/ENGINEERING SUPPORT]: Funding supports the procurement of Acoustics Upgrades equipment, Towed Systems hardware, and Large Vertical Array equipment.

[P40A / SA203 TOWED ARRAY UNIQUE TEST EQUIPMENT]: Funding procures various towed array test equipment simulators and handling system/stowage tube inspection test equipment.

[P40A / SA302 OP TRAINER UPGRADES]: Funding procures hardware upgrades and production engineering for Acoustic Upgrades operational trainer sites.

[P40A / SA303 COTS SUPPORTABILITY UPGRADES]: Provides for Technology Refresh/Insertion for A-RCI kits.  Tech Refresh provides for Software and Hardware updates to accommodate shifts in technology to the execution procurement years' "current state-of-the-practice" hardware. A-RCI has already undergone several technology insertion phases to accommodate integrating Advanced Processing Builds (APBs). Updates are necessary for signal and display processing hardware as APBs are introduced or as commercial support for the hardware is phased out.  Tech Insertion procures the hardware necessary to upgrade and back fit the A-RCI kits.  When A-RCI systems are being upgraded to subsequent phases of A-RCI, signal processing and display hardware will be procured from this line to accommodate common technology consistent with the APB being implemented in the year of introduction.  In future years, requirements include additional equipment in technology insertion to prevent COTS hardware from becoming unsupportable/obsolete.  Funding also supports the procurement and engineering for COTS Underwater Comms.

[P40A / SA401 INITIAL TRAINING]: Provides for initial training curriculum development, training management materials, exercise control group development, pilot services, and services to the Fleet.

            <proc:Description>VM201 - ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATIONS (ACOMMS) AND DEPTH SOUNDERS (funding ended in FY 2016):
Acoustic Communications provides one-way and two-way acoustic communications equipment for submarines and surface ships; Depth Sounders provide a means of measuring the depth of water below the face of a hull mounted transducer. The equipment consists of: (1) AN/WQC-2/2A, a stand-alone, single side-band, general purpose, voice, continuous wave, multiple tone communication for surface ships, submarines, and shore activities; (2) AN/WQC-6, which provides long range coded signaling from surface Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) ships to attack submarines when interfaced with the AN/SQS-53 and AN/BQQ-5; (3) AN/BQC-1, a stand-alone emergency voice and signal beacon for submarines; (4) AN/UQN-4/4A, a water depth measuring system that provides the distance between the ship keel and the ocean bottom; and (5) technical improvements (Engineering Changes (ECs)) to Acoustic Communication and Depth Sounder equipment. Funding will provide for continued procurement of both Probe Alert (AN/WQC-6) improvements and AN/WQC-2A and AN/UQN-4/4A ECs, plus associated production engineering support and consulting services for the SSN 21, SSN 688, SSN 774, SSBN 726, SSGN 726, DDG 51, CG 47, MCM 1, FFG 7, AS, LHA, LHD, LPD, LSD, and CVN 68 class ships and submarines.

VM301 - AIRCRAFT CARRIER TACTICAL SUPPORT CENTER (CV-TSC):
The AN/SQQ-34 Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center (CV-TSC) program provides increased situational awareness to the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in support of force protection, primarily in the area of ASW. Through the integration of off-board sensors and signal, data and display processors, the AN/SQQ-34 is utilized in detecting, classifying, and localizing threats. An integrated element of the Carrier Combat System, the AN/SQQ-34 supports the tactical deployment of embarked ASW and Surface Warfare (SUW) assets. The program provides technical refreshes to legacy AN/SQQ-34 systems on all Carriers and shore sites in support of Fleet introduction and shipboard integration of the MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter. Upgrades to legacy systems will enable exchange of sensor, tactical and imagery data with the MH-60R initially and eventually with P-8 and Triton Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) aircraft. It completes the Kill Chain by linking sensor platform to sensor controllers and the ASW/SUW commanders. In order to support multiple MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopters, the Common Data Link (CDL) will also be upgraded. CDL is the Navy Aircraft Carrier ultra wide-band, digital, secure data link, comprised of radio equipment that provides configuration-controlled and standardized wide-band, digital, and secure communication paths between multiple reconnaissance sensors and their users. Initially, a single User Interface Group (UIG) upgrade to CDL will be fielded in concert with CV-TSC/MH-60R deployments, providing a single MH-60R/aircraft link.

VM401 - SURFACE SONAR WINDOWS AND DOMES:
AN/SQS-26/53 Sonar Dome Rubber Windows (SDRW) are installed on CG47 and DDG51 class ships. This program provides emergency replacement, wire-reinforced, pressurized rubber acoustic windows and attachment hardware, which experience failure due to corrosion, fatigue, and impact damage. The SDRW significantly improves the surface ship sonar performance by reducing flow-induced self-noise and by providing increased source level receiving and sensitivity resulting from reduced attenuation. This program provides production engineering in support of technical evaluations, failure analysis, implementation of the in-water one-side backscatter X-ray program, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) refurbishments, and field service engineering; and complete engineering design work and material tests. This program also provides drawings, configuration management information, new design and fabrication technology, incorporation of lessons learned and required testing, and construct sub-element to confirm single-stage cure.

VM601 - UNDERSEA WARFARE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (USW-DSS)
USW-DSS provides an integrated, near-real time, net-centric ASW Command and Control (C2) capability across multiple surface platforms and critical shore sites. USW-DSS provides a critical C2 capability for the Sea Combat, Theater USW (TUSW), and ASW Commanders, and enables the ability to plan and conduct USW operations, alignment of sensors for exploitation of the environment, allocation of resources, optimization of operations and risk, and vulnerability assessment. It provides USW Commanders with an expanded net-centric USW capability across CSG platforms (CVNs, CG/DDGs, and Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS)) as well as supporting shore nodes to include Theater Surface Combatants (TSC), Training, Naval Oceanographic Processing Facility (NOPF), and Commander Task Force (CTF). This program procures and installs USW-DSS on CSG platforms and supporting shore nodes via permanent ship alterations (SHIPALTs). In FY 2009 USW-DSS transitioned to a software application hosted on the Integrated Shipboard Network System (ISNS) and in FY 2014 started installing as part of the Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES). Workstation procurements are required to support the ISNS and CANES configured ships as well as shore nodes. The program is included in the Littoral and Maritime Operations Mission Capability Package installed on Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and the Frigate (FF). USW-DSS capability is phased to effectively deliver software improvements to the warfighter. The current software version, Build 2 Release 3 (B2R3), will continue to field until the follow-on Build 3 (B3) certifies in FY 2019.

            <proc:Description>The Submarine Acoustic Warfare System (SAWS) program provides submarines with expendable defensive countermeasures and the systems necessary to externally launch them against torpedo and acoustic sensor threats. This program provides ongoing production of countermeasure devices needed to sustain fleet inventories, improvements to enhance the readiness and effectiveness of countermeasure devices and associated external countermeasure launcher (ECL) systems on all U.S. submarines. The expendable devices, Acoustic Device Countermeasures (ADC) are produced in two primary versions 3" ADC's are launched through the Internal Countermeasure Launcher (ICL) and 6" devices are launched through ECL Systems. An updated increased Acoustic Augmentation Support Program(AASP)SHIPALT installation cost estimate has slowed installs through FYDP and funds are shifted to accommodate increases in CSA engineering technology refresh and insertion costs, driven by ADC MK5 (NGCM) testing, and introduction in FY22-24.

WM018 - The Acoustic Augmentation Support Program (AASP) provides acoustic augmenting systems in appropriate configurations for all submarine classes (except SEAWOLF) installed as temporary equipment (a TEMPALT). A permanently installed Ship Alteration (SHIPALT)configuration for VIRGINIA Class Block I/II/III was developed and installations will start in FY17 (delayed from FY16 because budget insufficient for initial installation cost estimates). A permanent SHIPALT for VIRGINIA Class Block IV will be developed in FY17 and installations will start in FY26, gradually phasing out the TEMPALTs on VIRGINIA Class. Reliability and refresh upgrades sustain current in-service AASP systems with new components and software updates to maintain reliability.


WM019 - The Countermeasure Set, Acoustic (CSA) program procures and supports the inboard electronic system necessary for preparing and launching 6" Acoustic Device Countermeasures (ADCs) from all 688i and newer U.S. submarines. This inboard system consists of the Torpedo Defense Controller (TDC), Launch Control Panels (LCPs), and associated cabling, in a class-by-class configuration. The CSA program provides obsolescence support for legacy systems and engineering changes to accommodate modified and planned new devices, such as the ADC MK5. Four efforts are supported: (1) the "Technology Refresh" effort is designing, building, testing and certifying replacement components for obsolete CSA MK2 systems (MOD0/3/4) on 688i SSN and OHIO SSBN submarines, with the refresh occurring in FY16-FY20. (2) The "CSA MK3 Technology Insertion" effort is federating the CSA MK3 system with Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) to facilitate the ADC MK5 and Submarine Torpedo Defense Tactical Decision Aid (SubTDS TacDA) upon introduction. A phased approach was taken to allow a more efficient incremental implementation of initial capabilities. Required funding is expected to level off after ADC MK5 device fielding and address recurring upgrades with Advanced Processor Build/ Technology Insertion (APB/TI) cycles. (3) The "CSA MK4 Technology Insertion" effort replaces CSA MK2 MOD2 with CSA MK4 as a "SWFTS-federated" system on VIRGINIA Class Block I and II submarines (10 hulls) to accommodate the introduction of ADC MK5 devices. Non-recurring engineering will complete, with installs starting in FY19. (4) The fourth effort is the ongoing support of engineering issues across all CSA systems as they arise.

[P40A / WM014 6 INCH]: WM014 6 INCH - The 6" Countermeasures program procures, reworks, and refreshes ADC MK3 (torpedo countermeasure) devices, ADC MK4 (SONAR countermeasure) devices, and associated Launch Tubes in order to maintain submarine fleet countermeasure device inventory levels in accordance with the Naval Munition Requirements Process
(NMRP). The 6" Countermeasure program tracks and implements device improvements through configuration control and an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process. A Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was initiated in FY14 for ADC MK3 and MK4 devices to extend the usability of 6" devices. The next projected procurement contract will occur in FY19.

[P40A / WM015 3 INCH]: WM015 3 INCH - The 3" Countermeasures program procures NAE Beacon MK3 MODs 3 and 4, and ADC MK2 MODs 3, 5, and 7 countermeasure devices in order to maintain submarine fleet countermeasure device inventory levels in accordance with the Naval Munition Requirements Process (NMRP). The 3" Countermeasures program tracks and implements device improvements through configuration control and the ECP process. The Next Generation Countermeasure (NGCM) Program will transition the ADC MK5 into production outside of the FYDP, nominally starting in FY25, to become a part of the 3" countermeasure program. A shelf life extension completed in FY16, resulted in extending the shelf life from eight (8) to ten (10) years for ADC MK2 MODs 3,5 with set shelf life for ADC MK2 MOD 7 at 12years

[P40A / WM022 GAS GENERATOR MK77]: WM022 Gas Generator MK 77 - The MK77 Gas Generator (GG) program procures the energetic components required to launch the ADC MK3 and ADC MK4 countermeasure devices from the External Countermeasure Launchers (ECLs). The GG program also reworks existing devices to extend their service life, and tracks and implements device improvements through configuration control and ECP process. A SLEP for MK77 MOD0 devices was completed in FY16, resulted in extending the service life from two (2) to four (4) years for all devices except those installed aboard SSGN class submarines.

[P40A / WM830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING]: WM830 -  Production Engineering - The Production Engineering line provides production engineering services for SAWS Technical Design Agent (TDA) and In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) across all SAWS systems, including AASP.

[P40A / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING]: Production Engineering adjustment commensurate with anticipated work.  To support the ordnance assessment that is planned to extend the service life.

[P40A / WM900 CONSULTING SERVICES]: WM900 Consulting Services - The Consulting Services line procures contractor support services for all SAWS programs.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Acoustic Augmentation Support Program (AASP) provides acoustic augmenting systems in appropriate configurations for all submarine classes (except SEAWOLF) installed as temporary equipment (a TEMPALT). A permanently installed Ship Alteration (SHIPALT) configuration for VIRGINIA Class Block I/II/III was developed and installations will start in FY17 (delayed from FY16 due because budget insufficient for installation cost estimates). A permanent SHIPALT for VIRGINIA Class Block IV will be developed in FY17 and installations will start in FY26, gradually phasing out the TEMPALTs on VIRGINIA Class. Reliability and refresh upgrades sustain current in-service AASP systems with new components and software updates to maintain reliability.
Includes production support for BLK I-IV SHIPALTS and the AASP reliability and refurbishment upgrade.
AASP includes costs of procuring new systems and reuse of available components, including the HLF-1, for SHIPALT installation such that "unit cost" is a mix of new and used components. An additional HLF-1 transducer (not a complete full system) is procured in FY17 ($587K) and FY19 ($610K).
Reliability and refurbishment upgrade to sustain current in-service AASP systems.
Non-recurring costs to produce AASP SHIPALT Package.</proc:Remarks>

Furthermore, the line was updated to account for System Kits procurements starting in FY20 at lower unit cost vice the complete systems procured in FY16-19. Also, the CSA MK4 complete system cut from FY17 in earlier budgets is being restored in FY20 to allow completion of the CSA MK 4 on the final VIRGINIA platform. CSA systems after initial suite installation will be updated using hardware kits and software. The kits procurements were added to the line to allow CSA to meet upgrade/modernization schedules for VIRGINIA Blocks I/II.

                    <proc:Description>WM019 - The Countermeasure Set, Acoustic (CSA) program procures and supports the inboard electronic system necessary for preparing and launching 6" Acoustic Device Countermeasures (ADCs) from all 688i and newer U.S. submarines. This inboard system consists of the Torpedo Defense Controller (TDC), Launch Control Panels (LCPs), and associated cabling, in a class-by-class configuration. The CSA program provides obsolescence support for legacy systems and engineering changes to accommodate modified and planned new devices, such as the ADC MK5. Four efforts are supported: (1) the "Technology Refresh" effort is designing, building, testing and certifying replacement components for obsolete CSA MK2 systems (MOD0/3/4) on 688i SSN and OHIO SSBN submarines, with the refresh occurring in FY16-FY20. (2) The "CSA MK3 Technology Insertion" effort is federating the CSA MK3 system with Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) to facilitate the ADC MK5 and Submarine Torpedo Defense Tactical Decision Aid (SubTDS TacDA) upon introduction. A phased approach was taken to allow a more efficient incremental implementation of initial capabilities. Required funding is expected to level off after ADC MK5 device fielding and address recurring upgrades with Technology Insertion/Advanced Processor Build (TI/APB). (3) The "CSA MK4 Technology Insertion" effort replaces CSA MK2 MOD2 with CSA MK4 as a "SWFTS-federated" system on VIRGINIA Class Block I and II submarines (10 hulls) to accommodate the introduction of ADC MK5 devices. Non-recurring engineering, production testing, EQT and SHIPALT/Logistics documentation will continue in FY18, with installs starting in FY19 to better align with overall submarine availabilities scheduling. (4) The fourth effort is the ongoing support of engineering issues across all CSA systems as they arise.

            <proc:Description>PROGRAM COVERAGE: Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS) is the mobile, tactical, and strategic arm of the Navy's undersea surveillance capability that provides deep ocean and littoral acoustic detection and cueing for tactical weapon platforms against diesel and nuclear submarines as well as surface vessels in any given Area of Operations worldwide.  Dedicated Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) T-AGOS ships tow long acoustic arrays that collect acoustic data and relay that data to shore facilities via satellites for processing and fusion of the resulting contact data with other sensors.  Currently, there are five Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) T-AGOS ships operating in the Pacific area.  Ship configurations are:
 
(1)  T-AGOS 22 USNS LOYAL, supports passive operations using the TB-29A Twinline (TL-29A) array, providing improved detection and classification capability. This ship class uses the Integrated Common Processor (ICP) signal processing and display system common with the SSN Advanced Rapid Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Insertion (ARCI) Sonar Processing System;  

(3) Three T-AGOS SWATH-P platforms, T-AGOS 19 USNS VICTORIOUS, T-AGOS 20 USNS ABLE, and T-AGOS 21 USNS EFFECTIVE, supporting passive/active operations, configured with the ICP processing and display system, the TL-29A array, and the Compact Low Frequency Active (CLFA) transmit capability;

(2) One Low Frequency Active (LFA) equipped ship, T-AGOS 23 USNS IMPECCABLE, configured with the ICP Processing and Display system, the TL-29A array, and the Low Frequency Active (LFA) transmit capability. The active capability provides greatly improved detection against diesel submarines as well as the quiet nuclear submarine threat.
 

In addition to the five platforms described above, two shore sites are configured with the ICP processing and display suites to receive the T-AGOS acoustic data via SHF satellite communication links.  One of the two shore sites is equipped with two (2) SURTASS Team Trainers (STTs) to support Home Port Training Periods.  

A cost sharing agreement with Japan also provides a shore site and two Japanese SWATH ships with similar capability to the T-AGOS SWATH ships for the Western Pacific region.  The Japanese Auxiliary Ocean Surveillance (JAOS) ships will be upgraded to the TL-29A array beginning in FY17.

The array consists of 2 shorter array lengths and array support equipment, and is designed for increased surveillance capability in high clutter environments and littoral areas.  Support equipment procurement is for ancillary test sets, array headline and roll control systems, tow cable, and leader cables. Installation funding is not required for the support equipment.  FY18-FY22 fund refurbishment of one (1) to two (2) array legs per year.  Cost Variability: In FY17, a U.S. array was added to the SURTASS budget for $9M, while a J-AOS TL-29A array upgrade was added for $15M. The entire $6M increase above inflation is related to the J-AOS program requirement. The U.S. system being procured is essentially identical to the array procured in FY12 (two array legs WITHOUT associated towing hardware, dry end equipment, or installation costs). For the J-AOS TL-29A procurement, costs are associated with upgrading to a new array type and array support infrastructure, including two complete towed arrays and associated tow hardware and dry end equipment, as well as a third array procured in FY21. The program is funded with both FMS and OPN, and the $15M in FY17 and $9.4M in FY21 represent the U.S. share of the total cost of the J-AOS TL-29A upgrade program.  Installation Remarks:  Installation only occurs on 5 platforms.  Historically, an array is lost or severely damaged every 18 months.  Last array was lost Sept 06, last array severely damaged was Jul 14 - this array in use as a ready asset in theater.  Without a ready asset in theater, if an array is lost or damaged, a SURTASS ship cannot deploy and execute its mission.  Future assets to be delivered are initially provided as ready assets, and installed as needed.">J-AOS/U.S. Twinline Arrays -- Procurement</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: SURTASS Team Trainer

The SURTASS Team Trainer (STT) provides SURTASS crews with two high fidelity synthetic and live playback training capabilities to support Home Port Training Periods (HPTP) and Pre-Deployment Certification Periods (PDCP).  Each trainer will be refreshed on a 4 year cycle with the last refresh in FY16.  Tech Refresh for 2nd trainer will be in FY18 with installation the following year.  Tech refresh for the STTs will continue on this cycle. 
The 4-7% procurement cost growth between FY18, FY20, and FY22 accounts for the additional team trainer capabilities incorporated to provide operators with the means to address more sophisticated threat targets and environments. Similarly, installation costs increase slightly from FY17 to FY19 as a result of additional integration and testing considerations related to the more sophisticated trainer.</proc:Remarks>

Additionally, cyclical technical refresh efforts can be more significant in some years than others based on a range of factors, which include end of life components that require refresh; the need to incorporate significant cyber security and program protection related requirements, inspections and testing into a particular ICP system undergoing refresh; or the need to update Configuration Control Models (CCMs) or Engineering Measurements Program (EMP) systems for each major hardware refresh.  Accordingly, the procurement and installation costs will vary from one platform to another, depending on the configuration and the ship.">1.1.1) Integrated Common Processor - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>FY16 and out-year funding continues cyclical ICP technical refresh of hardware.

ICP system configuration varies from ship to ship depending upon the type of arrays used (passive only, or passive and active).  Additionally, Tech refresh efforts can be more significant in some years than others based on a range of factors, which include end of life components that require refresh; the need to incorporate significant cyber security and program protection related requirements, inspections and testing into a particular ICP system undergoing refresh; or the need to update Configuration Control Models (CCMs) or Engineering Measurements Program (EMP) systems for each major hardware refresh.  Accordingly, the procurement and installation costs will vary from one platform to another, depending on the configuration and the ship.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Field Changes/Modifications for correction of deficiencies identified by Fleet use, array support, communications equipment and replacement of aging/unsupportable equipment. Additional FY18-FY22 funding will facilitate transition to an upgraded command and control system, including installation of the Consolidated Afloat Network Enterprise System (CANES). Other aging End-of-life systems, including Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M), UHF Line-of-sight Satellite (LOS/SAT), and ship's gyros will need to be replaced in order to ensure continuity of operations should the primary acoustic path to shore become inoperable.
Cost growth is reflective of funding for C4I Modernization added in POM-18.  Costs for individual C4I systems being procured are varied, resulting in the variability in individual unit costs across the fiscal years, with the primary procurements occurring in FY18.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Commencing in FY17 this line item was consolidated with OPN LI 2906 (PE 0204660N), to align TacMobile C4I procurements with TacMobile MPRF P-8A Aircraft Support Systems procurements.

Tactical/Mobile (TacMobile) Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) systems : Tactical/Mobile (TacMobile) Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force Systems provide the MPRF commanders with the capability to plan, direct, control and evaluate the tactical operations of MPRF and other assigned units within their respective area of responsibility. These operations include littoral, open ocean, and over land all sensor (e.g., Electro Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), Inverse Synthetic-Aperture Radar (ISAR)) surveillance, anti-surface warfare, over-the-horizon targeting, counter-drug operations, power projection, antisubmarine warfare, mining, search and rescue, homeland defense, and special operations.

The program includes fixed-site Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) and Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (MTOCs) or equivalent. Each TacMobile unit is a system-of-systems. TOCs provide sensor and tactical data communications systems; mission planning/mission support, sensor analysis capabilities; avionics and weapons system interfaces, media devices and data handling capabilities, at fixed-site locations. MTOC is a scalable, mobile version of the TOC for contingency operations and for support of operations from remote forward operating airfields.

The TacMobile program uses an evolutionary development strategy consisting of incremental upgrades to meet new and emergent Fleet requirements, while retaining current capabilities. Increments are planned and resourced to support the MPRF Family of Systems aircraft: P-8A Poseidon aircraft and its upgrades; Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS); and MQ-4C Triton.

7 TOCs: 6 operational systems (located at Jacksonville Florida, Sigonella Italy, Kaneohe Bay Hawaii, Whidbey Island Washington, Kadena Japan, and Bahrain), 1 laboratory system (the "TacMobile Systems Integration Lab" (TMSIL), collocated at SSC Atlantic detachment Patuxent River Maryland with PMA-290's P-8A "Pax River Systems Integration Lab" (PAXSIL)).

15 MTOCs: 9 operational systems (homeported at Jacksonville Florida (5 sites),  Whidbey Island Washington (2 sites), and Coronado (North Island) California (2 sites)), 1 laboratory system (an aircraft integration lab located at Navy Detachment Dallas), 1 C4I engineering and maintenance support system (located at the In Service Engineering Activity (ISEA), SSC Atlantic), 1 C4I mobile systems schoolhouse (located at the Center for Naval Air Technical Training (CNATT) Jacksonville Florida) and 3 legacy systems awaiting End-to-End refresh/recapitalization to meet current operational configuration/requirements (SSC Lant).

This line item upgrades TOC/MTOC sensor analysis, mission planning, in-flight mission support capabilities, avionics and weapons system interfaces, computer upgrades and associated software for interfacing, analysis and processing equipment to the supported weapons systems (aircraft).  Additionally, the line item upgrades mobility and facilities equipment necessary to power and support the processing equipment and interfaces.</proc:Description>

The SEWIP Block 1B3, Block 2 and Block 3 units are installed conjunctively to compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 system. The SEWIP Block 2 P-3a funding has been broken out to separately show systems installed with SEWIP Block 1B3 (FMP Block 2 for SLQ-32 (V)6 ) and systems installed with SEWIP Block 1B3 and Block 3 (FMP Block 2 for SLQ-32 (V)7). For FMP Block 2 systems for SLQ-32 (V)7, production lead times for Block 2 are 17 months and these systems are then delivered to the Block 3 OEM 180 days prior to delivery as part of an integrated SLQ-32 (V)7 system. The 180 days is required for integration and testing with SEWIP Block 3 at the OEM facility.

TC060:  SURFACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW) IMPROVEMENTS BLOCK 3:
Block 3 will provide an Electronic Attack (EA) capability improvement required for the AN/SLQ-32(V) system to keep pace with the threat. The upgrade will provide a common EA capability to all surface combatants (CVN, CG, DDG, LHA) outfitted with the active variant of the AN/SLQ-32, mainly the (V)3 and (V)4, as well as select new-construction platforms. The program builds on the EW Electronic Support (ES) capability delivered by Blocks 1 and 2.  Development Status/Major Milestones are: Long Lead Materials will be procured Q4 FY17, Milestone C Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Q4 FY18, IOT&amp;E Q1 FY21, FRP is Q3 FY21. The SEWIP Block 1B3, Block 2 and Block 3 units are installed conjunctively to compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 system. 

Block 3T (AN/SLQ-59) will provide an Electronic Attack (EA) capability improvement required for the AN/SLQ32(V) system to keep pace with the threat.  Block 3T provides initial, limited interim capability of a focused application of the Naval Research Lab (NRL) Transportable EW Module (TEWM) system to meet an urgent operational needs statement.

Development Status/Major Development Milestones are: Milestone C/Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 4Q FY12, Full Rate Production (FRP) 4Q FY16. Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) funding is provided to support changes resulting from software and hardware trouble reports from production, shipboard installations and/or land based testing. Tech Refresh funding is provided to address obsolescence and reliability issues affecting fielded systems. The SEWIP Block 1B3 and Block 2 units are installed conjunctively to compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 system.  The SEWIP Block 1B3, Block 2 and Block 3 units are installed conjunctively to compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 system.  The SEWIP Block 1B3 P-3a funding has been broken out to separately show systems installed with SEWIP Block 2 (FMP Block 1B3 for SLQ-32 (V)6 ) and systems installed with SEWIP Block 2 and Block 3 (FMP Block 1B3 for SLQ-32 (V)7). For FMP Block 1B3 systems for SLQ-32 (V)7, production lead times for Block 1B3 are 15 months and these systems are then delivered to the Block 3 OEM 180 days prior to delivery as part of an integrated SLQ-32 (V)7 system. The 180 days is required for integration and testing with SEWIP Block 3 at the OEM facility. Notes:   (1) Production Support provides for Government oversight of production, Government and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) support of production related software and hardware problems, and engineering as well as integrated logistics support efforts in support of production and fielding.  (2) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) funding is to address reliability, obsolescence, and other issues associated with production, and is estimated at 3% of the total hardware cost.     (3) Total quantities increased from 127 at PB17 to 129 at PB18 due to a decrease of one in the Fleet units, an increase of two shore units and an increase of one OEM unit. (4) FY15-FY19 hardware unit costs reflect actual FY15 contract prices.  (5) Installation cost estimates have been revised based on actual costs of installations to date.   (6) The FY15-19 production contract was originally awarded in June 2015 but the award was protested to GAO. GAO upheld the protest and the subsequent contract was awarded in Dec 2015. (7) The FY16 production contract option was awarded in September 2016.    (8) FY16 procured shore unit, being installed in FY19 as a (V)7 shore site installation, is required to be delivered to the Block 3 OEM for system integration NLT Jan 2019 (180 days prior to the corresponding Block 3 unit).  This is within the delivery period for the FY16 procurements.  The FY18 procured shore unit, being installed in  FY20, a (V)7 shore site installation, is required to be delivered to the Block 3 OEM for system integration NLT July 2019.  This is within the projected delivery period for the FY18 procurements.">1.1.1) FMP BLOCK 1B3 for SLQ-32 (V)6 - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

(2) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) funding is to address reliability, obsolescence, and other issues associated with production, and is estimated at 3% of the total hardware cost.   (3) Total quantity increased from 128 at PB17 to 135 at PB18. This resulted from the decrease of one in the Fleet unit, addition of two (2)Block 2 shore units to support SEWIP Block 3 shore units, the addition of five (5) SEWIP Block 2 Lite systems to support the Off Shore Patrol Cutter (OPC) and the increase of one OEM unit.  (4) FY16 production support increased from PB17 to PB18 due to several unanticipated requirements including IOT&amp;E phase B efforts, shock qualification, and combat system integration efforts.  (5) FY16 ECP funding increased from PB17 to PB18 due increased requirements for software changes including software configurations for AEGIS non-PLA, SSDS, and AEGIS PLA, and hardware changes including single mode fiber, RCS panels, improved target holders, and the network Ethernet switch replacement.   (6) Block 2 unit costs reflect actual FY15 contract prices.  (7) Installation cost estimates have been revised to reflect the actual costs for SEWIP Block 2 installations.   (8) The FY16 procured shore unit, being installed in FY19 as a (V)7 shore site installation, is required to be delivered to the Block 3 OEM for system integration NLT Jan 2019 (180 days prior to the corresponding Block 3 unit).  This is within the delivery period for the FY16 procurements.  The FY18 procured shore unit, being installed in  FY20 as a (V)7 shore site installation, is required to be delivered to the Block 3 OEM for system integration NLT July 2019.  This is within the projected delivery period for the FY18 procurements. (9) Production Lead times are 12 months for Block 2 Lite Units and 17 Months for Block 2 units. The SEWIP Block 2 P-3a funding has been broken out to separately show systems installed with SEWIP Block 2 (FMP Block 1B2 for SLQ-32 (V)6 ) and systems installed with SEWIP Block 2 and Block 3 (FMP Block 2 for SLQ-32 (V)7). For FMP Block 2 systems for SLQ-32 (V)7, production lead times for Block 2 are 17 months and these systems are then delivered to the Block 3 OEM 180 days prior to delivery as part of a SLQ-32 (V)7 system. The 180 days is required for integration and testing with SEWIP Block 3 at the OEM facility. (10) Funding for Installation and Check Out (INCO) spares to support FY18-FY22 procured units have been called out separately in the SEWIP Block 2 hardware line as 1.1.X.">1.1.1) FMP BLOCK 2 for SLQ-32 (V)6 - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

For FMB Block 2 systems for SLQ-32 (V)7, production lead times for Block 2 are 17 months and these systems are then delivered to the Block 3 OEM 180 days prior to delivery as part of a SLQ-32 (V)7 system.  The 180 days is required for integration and testing with SEWIP Block 3 at the OEM facility.">Lockheed Martin</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>Block 2 will provide AN/SLQ-32(V) an upgraded antenna, receiver, and combat systems interface. The upgrades will pace the threat, improve detection and accuracy and mitigate Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Development Status/Major Development Milestones are: Milestone C Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 4Q FY13, Full Rate Production (FRP) 4Q FY16. Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) funding is provided to support changes resulting from software and hardware trouble reports from production, shipboard installations and/or land based testing. Tech Refresh funding is provided to address obsolescence and reliability issues affecting fielded systems. The Block 2 hardware cost includes the SEWIP Block 2 ES system, SLA-10D blanker, Common Processing System, Common Display System, Liquid Conditioning Unit and Data Adaptation Processor.  Block 2 Lite is a variant of the Block 2 specifically tailored for the needs of small ships, such as LCS, OPC and the Fast Frigate, to address fleet emergent needs for a robust, capable, and sustainable EW system, that meets the space, weight and power limitations of these smaller ships. The SEWIP Block 1B3 and Block 2 units are installed conjunctively and compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)6 system. The SEWIP Block 1B3, Block 2 and Block 3 units are installed conjunctively to compose the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 system. The SEWIP Block 2 P-3a funding has been broken out to separately show systems installed with SEWIP Block 1B3 (FMP Block 2 for SLQ-32 (V)6 ) and systems installed with SEWIP Block 1B3 and Block 3 (FMP Block 2 for SLQ-32 (V)7). For FMP Block 2 systems for SLQ-32 (V)7, production lead times for Block 2 are 17 months and these systems are then delivered to the Block 3 OEM 180 days prior to delivery as part of an integrated SLQ-32 (V)7 system. The 180 days is required for integration and testing with SEWIP Block 3 at the OEM facility.</proc:Description>

Unit Price Cost for (Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Increment F (and variants (Tactical Cryptologic System)(TCS)) and SSEE MODS (Modifications) in FY16 and FY17 have been updated due the award of a new Procurement Contract awarded in July 2016.

Procurement UPCs for SSEE Increment F and SSEE MODS are based on contracted quantity discounts; SSEE OPN procurements are awarded with SSEE SCN, FMS and Coast Guard System procurements to achieve the best value for the government.

The FY18 SSEE Increment F Procurement contract award will include a total of 8 systems (6 OPN, 1 SCN and 1 Coast Guard) resulting in a UPC of $7.888M. The FY17 SSEE Increment F Procurement contract award will include a total of 9 systems (6 OPN, 2 SCN and 1 Coast Guard) resulting in a UPC of $7.202M.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Description>The Ship Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Inc F Program will provide strike groups with Information Operation (IO) / non-kinetic capabilities and the subsequent ability to exploit Signals Of Interest (SOI) by providing a state-of-the-art system which detects, acquires, and collects data on any potential threat.

[Inc F Systems (Ship)] Unit Price Cost for (Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Increment F (and variants (Tactical Cryptologic System)(TCS)) and SSEE MODS (Modifications) in FY16 and FY17 have been updated due the award of a new Procurement Contract awarded in July 2016.

Procurement UPCs for SSEE Increment F and SSEE MODS are based on contracted quantity discounts; SSEE OPN procurements are awarded with SSEE SCN, FMS and Coast Guard System procurements to achieve the best value for the government.

[TCS Below Deck and Core] Tactical Cryptologic System (TCS) is a scalable, modular variant of SSEE Increment F that allows configuration to meet platform mission requirements.  TCS leverages SSEE Increment F common software, training, and logistics.  TCS consists of infrastructure (Topside Antennas) which will be permanently installed on 41 Unit Level ships. The Below Deck Core system includes a modular component to all Mission Tailorable upgrades to increase capabilities. The modularity and scalability of TCS is delivered using Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).</proc:Description>

First quarter installations reflected in the Installation Schedule are funded in the prior year in order to be able to fund the installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work.  90 days are needed to allow sufficient time for the contractor to plan the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication.  This procedure allows installations to be scheduled in the first quarter thereby supporting Fleet availability.">1.1.2) Graywing - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>SSEE Modifications is comprised of the Paragon and Graywing subsystems. Beginning in FY15, Paragon capabilities are collapsed into Graywing hardware resulting in cost efficiencies. Paragon is a classified Navy tactical signals intelligence frequency extension capability that will be integrated into Ship Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) systems.  This capability provides simultaneous detection, collection, processing, Information Operations and display of communication intelligence data from hostile, high threat and adversary platforms in select frequency ranges that are not prosecuted or countered today. Graywing is an advanced common data link system that will be integrated into SSEE Inc E and Inc F systems.  It is a critical component of "Ballistic Missile Defense, Executive Committee, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Chief of Naval Operations, Executive Board Information Operation (IO) Countermeasure Red Flash" (details held at a higher classification level).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>1U030: Automatic Identification System (AIS) is an international maritime Very High Frequency (VHF) communication system that allows ships to exchange information (machine to machine) on navigation (position, course, speed, etc), ship information (ship name, call sign, length/beam), cargo information (draft, type, destination, route, estimated time of arrival), and messaging (safety, text).  This technology improves capability in three diverse areas: (a) situational awareness/common operational picture, (b) navigation/safety of ship and, (c) other intelligence gathering/correlation.  AIS will procure Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) AIS gear and install them on Navy warships.  This provides the fleet with an operating capability to send unclassified data to the Maritime Operations Center (MOC).  AIS provides an integrated AIS capability on force level United States (US) surface warships and submarines, including interfaces with ship's Global Command and Control System-Maritime/Common Operational Picture, and combat systems as defined by fleet requirements and concept of operations. The program provides Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) AIS Sensor Server equipment to the MOC for publishing AIS data to the MDA Data Sharing Community of Interest.  Funds will procure and install AIS systems for ships, submarines and shore sites consisting of a combination of modified COTS and government/commercial software, such as omni-directional VHF, Global Positioning System antennas, AIS transponders, displays and associated cables, servers, power supplies, laptop computers, junction boxes, switches and radio frequency couplers.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 funds provide for the procurement of two AIS submarine system, integration testing to support AIS installations on SSBN class submarines, installation funding for one submarine, and associated Design Services Allocation.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) significantly improves Battle Force Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) capability by coordinating all Battle Force AAW sensors into a single, real-time, composite track picture capable of fire control quality.  CEC distributes sensor data from each ship and aircraft, or cooperating unit (CU), to all other CUs in the battle force through a real-time, line of sight, high data rate sensor and engagement data distribution network.  CEC is highly resistant to jamming and provides accurate gridlocking between CUs.  Each CU independently employs high capacity, parallel processing and advanced algorithms to combine all distributed sensor data into a fire control quality track picture which is the same for all CUs.  CEC data is presented as a superset of the best AAW sensor capabilities from each CU, all of which are integrated into a single input to each CU's combat weapons system.  CEC significantly improves our Battle Force defense in depth, including both local area and ship defense capabilities against current and future AAW threats.  Moreover, CEC provides critical connectivity and integration of over-land air defense systems capable of countering emerging air threats, including land attack cruise missiles, in a complex littoral environment.

CEC consists of the Data Distribution System (DDS), the Cooperative Engagement Processor (CEP), and Combat System modifications.  The DDS encodes and distributes ownship sensor and engagement data and is a high capacity, jam resistant, directive system providing a precision gridlocking and high throughput of data.  The CEP is a high capacity distributed processor that is able to process force levels of data in near real-time.  This data is passed to the ship's combat system as high quality data for which the ship can cue its onboard sensors or use the data to engage targets without actually tracking them.  The Navy has begun implementation of a Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) approach to modify the current equipment to meet reduced size, weight, cost, power and cooling objectives.  This P3I approach also supports continuity for interoperability improvements and program protection, as well as supporting open architecture initiatives and comms independence.  P3I will provide hardware which complies with Category 3 Open Architecture Core Environment (OACE) standards with rehosted existing software, which will be fielded fleet-wide to allow affordable replacement of obsolete computing system components and eliminate dependencies on "closed" equipment, operating systems, and middleware.

A family of antennas approach will be used to satisfy CEC requirements with lower life cycle costs (procurement, installation, and maintenance) and reduced weight (on mast and below deck).  These antennas enable future capability as well as providing a solution extensible to additional platforms.  A competitive contract for Common Array Block (CAB) antenna development and production was awarded late FY13.  CEC is planned for shipboard installations at various Naval and commercial shipyards aboard CG/CG Mod, DDG/DDG Mod, CV/CVN, LPD, LHD, DDG 1000, and LHA ship classes during scheduled ship availability periods and at land based test sites (LBTS).

Command and Control Processor (C2P) Technology Refresh Full Systems Ship/Shore (DR003): C2P computer processing boards are obsolete and have antiquated software code with no industrial base support. Technology refresh is required for C2P software modernization. Additionally, C2P configuration is not shock qualified. Full Systems upgrades are required to achieve 901D shock certification.

Command and Control Processor (C2P) Amphibious Assault Ship (LHD) Upgrades (DR003): Changes to LHD combat systems starting in FY13 will require NGC2P/CDLMS upgrades in order to maintain critical data link functions including simultaneous processing of Link 11, Link 16 and JRE.

Link 16 Upgrade Kits Ship/Shore (DR012): Link 16 terminals will be upgraded on U.S. Navy surface platforms. Existing Link 16 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System terminals and Multifunctional Information Distribution System  on Ship (MOS) terminals will be implemented with Frequency Remapping (FR) and Crypto Modernization (CM) mandated upgrades. The product improvement will bring the Link 16 terminals in compliance with the Department of Defense / Department of Transportation Memorandum of Agreement (31DEC02) and updated National Security Agency approved cryptographic algorithms.

Link 16 MOS Modernization (MOS MOD) Replacement Ship/Shore (DR012): CVN's and ships which currently are outfitted with JTIDS terminals will have Link 16 terminals replaced with modernized MOS terminals in addition to meeting Frequency Remapping and Crypto Modernization mandated upgrades. MOS Mod units will transition to the use of Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-J) Current Multi-Netting (CMN) terminal vice MIDS-J Core terminals.

Link 16 Antenna Replacement (DR012): Existing obsolete dedicated Link 16 shipboard antenna will be replaced.

Link 16 MOS Terminal Controller Central Processing Unit (TC CPU Update): TC CPU update is required to address obsolescence issue in the TC CPU as well as provide mandated transition to Windows 10 operating system. Will be fielded on all MOS ships. 

Link Monitoring Management Tool (LMMT) Ship/Shore (DR014): LMMT is required to enable Joint Interface Control Officers (JICOs) to effectively monitor and manage the performance of tactical data link networks. Funds procurement and installation of LMMT hardware on ships and shore sites. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) will also be procured and installed for the CVNs.

Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) Training (DR666): Develop initial end-to-end training curriculum and simulators.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Advanced Tactical Data Link Systems (ATDLS) procure command and control equipment for both shipboard and shore units including the Multifunctional Information Distribution System on Ship (MOS) Modernization (MOD) Terminals, Link 16 Network Program Antennas, Command and Control Processor (C2P) hardware and software, and increase in Link Monitoring Management Tool (LMMT) hardware and software to address Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI) obsolesce issues.

FY2018: The increase in ATDLS OPN budget is required to address significant C2P system hardware obsolescence issues with the legacy installed base. These obsolescence issues are negatively impacting system Ao (availability). Additionally, C2P Tech Refresh production is increasing significantly to support mission requirements for both AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and accelerated Amphibious ship C5I connectivity requirements to support F35 strike fighter data link communications. It should be noted that Link 16 Network JTIDS, MOS, and MOS MOD production efforts have moved to FY19 and beyond and are still under OSD mandate to fully field Link 16 Frequency Remapping capabilities on all platforms by 2025. 

Link 16 Antenna Upgrade unit cost increase is due to an upgrade to AS4775, which will improve capability to receive/transit on increased frequency spectrum and improve elevation angle and strengthen mast extensions.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Funding includes Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M), the Navy fielded portions of GCCS-Joint, and Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS).  GCCS-M is further delineated by Afloat and Ashore.

GCCS-M is the Maritime implementation of the United States (U.S.) Global Command and Control System (GCCS).  It provides Maritime Commanders at all echelons of command with a single, integrated, scalable Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system that fuses, correlates, filters, maintains and displays location, and attribute information on friendly, hostile and neutral land, sea and air forces.  It takes this information and integrates it with available intelligence and environmental information to support commander decision making.  It operates in near real-time, constantly updating unit positions and other situational awareness data.  GCCS-M also records data in appropriate databases and maintains a history of changes to those records.  System operators use the data to construct relevant tactical pictures using maps, charts, topography overlays, oceanographic overlays, meteorological overlays, imagery and all-source intelligence information coordinated into a Common Operational Picture (COP) that can be shared locally and with other sites.  GCCS-M is not a weapon system, but receives data from, and interfaces with Navy integrated weapons systems.  Navy Commanders review and evaluate the general tactical situation, plan actions and operations, direct forces, synchronize tactical movements, and integrate force maneuver with firepower.  GCCS-M operates on General Service (GENSER) Secret networks in a variety of environments and supports joint, coalition and allied forces.  GCCS-M is implemented Afloat and at Ashore fixed command centers.  Increment 1 includes all GCCS-M software versions 4.0 and earlier.  Increment 2 is GCCS-M 4.1.

[P5 / FA010 GCCS-M Afloat]: GCCS-M Afloat provides Command and Control capability to Force Level Ships (e.g., CVN Carriers, LCC Command Ships, LHA and LHD Amphibious Ships), Unit Level Ships (e.g., CG Cruisers, DDG Destroyers, MCM Mine Countermeasure Ships, LPD and LSD Amphibious Ships, FF/LCS Littoral Combat Ships, PC Coastal Patrol Ships), Submarines (e.g., SSN/SSBN/SSGN Submarines), the Software Support Activity (SSA), and the In-Service Engineering Activity (ISEA).

[P5 / FA020 GCCS-M Ashore]: GCCS-M Ashore provides evolutionary systems and ancillary equipment upgrades to support Fleet Commanders, Force Anti-Submarine Warfare Commanders, Submarine Operating Authorities, Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Systems, and Technical Training Equipment Sites worldwide.  GCCS-M Ashore provides systems that receive, process, display, maintain and/or assess unit characteristics, employment scheduling, material condition, combat readiness, war fighting capabilities, and positional information of own, allied, and hostile forces.  GCCS-M Ashore provides the tools necessary for fleet and Shore based Commanders to execute plans, transmit tasking, and provide tactical information to subordinate forces.

[P5 / FA040 GCCS (Joint) Support Equipment]: Global Command and Control System- Joint (GCCS-J) is a Department of Defense (DoD) Program of Record managed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) GCCS-J Program Management Office (PMO).   The  GCCS-J system requirements, software release schedule, and system fielding plan are determined by the DISA GCCS-J PMO in coordination with the Joint Staff.  GCCS-J supports the Joint Staff and Combatant Commanders  by providing Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) data processing capabilities, including status of forces and support requirements for use in national security decision making, force preparation and operational planning and execution. Global Command and Control System- Joint (GCCS-J) provides support for Fleet Communications Center interfacing with deployed units and other fixed Fleet and Joint Command Centers.

[P5 / FA060 Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS)]: Provide funding for the fielding of JADOCS software on new installation hardware. JADOCS is required to provide the capability to coordinate joint targeting and mission assignment for time sensitive targets and other rapid-response missions across Functional Component Commanders, Joint and Combined Force Commanders, Geographic Combatant Commanders, and Special Operations Commanders.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Provide systems, subsystems, and engineering change kits for minehunting, navigation, and tactical display operations by the surface Mine Countermeasure (MCM) force.  Engineering change kits improve reliability and maintainability and correct deficiencies to allow equipment to perform in accordance with operational requirements.

[P5 / HME SHIP SYSTEMS]: A tech refresh is necessary to procure material and install the Integrated Ship Control System (ISCS) upgrades on MCM Class Ships forward deployed.  Alteration SCD 78356 will upgrade five computer workstations, replace network switches, and replace the Windows NT operating system with Windows 7. Legacy sustainment will not provide the necessary support because the workstations and network hardware are beyond their intended service lives. In addition, the operating system is not supported by the provider. Parts obsolescence results in procurement delays of urgent warfighting upgrades for deployed ships. Specifically, there is an increased risk of loss of core propulsion, electric and auxiliary plant functionality. ISCS legacy sustainment inhibits MCM capability to get underway to conduct missions in a region of the world that is of vital strategic importance to the United States. Therefore, a tech refresh is necessary to support the MCM mine hunting and minesweeping capability whereas legacy sustainment is not feasible and would result in delays and obsolescence. This alteration has been identified as a priority because this capability is only found on the MCM Class Ships. The MCM Readiness Task Force Report identified implementation of this alteration as the #3 priority and the MCM Operational Advisory Group Brief identified implementation of this alteration as the #7 priority MCM alteration.

[P5 / LV082 - AFT DECK EQUIPMENT UPGRADE]: This program will install an inverter electric motor on the magnetic cable reel, acoustic cable reel, minesweeping winch and self contained hydraulic power unit on the stern crane.

[P5 / LV073 - MCM/MHC INTEGRATED SHIP CONTROL SYSTEM]: This program funds software integration and hardware upgrades to the MCM-1 class ships' Integrated Ship Control System. Ship change upgrades computer workstations, replaces network switches, and replaces the operating system.

[P5 - 2 / LV075 - MCM COMBAT SYSTEMS]: The MCM Combat System Upgrades program consists of a series of incremental upgrades to the current combat system via Engineering Change Kits. The upgrades improve reliability and maintainability and correct deficiencies to allow the equipment to perform in accordance with operational requirements. The current planned upgrades include: 
- Supportability and Obslesence Upgrade Engineering Changes - upgrade and modernization of the MCM-1 Class Ship combat systems to reduce current and emergent obsolescence and supportability issues with the SQQ-32, SSN-2, Battle Space Profiler, AAG, SLQ-48 Power Distribution Unit, and the AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System.
- Mine Neutralization System is installation of SEAFOX neutralizers on 4 MCM Avenger Class Ships by replacing the existing AN/SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization System. 
- Klein Sonar - Funds obsolescence upgrades to the Klein sonar.  These efforts maintain the ability to rotate systems off of MCM-1's for required overhaul and system upgrades to increase system Operational Availability.
- Mine Environmental Decision Aids Library (MEDAL) Expeditionary Systems - Installation of MEDAL onboard MCM Ships and to ashore MEDAL users. MEDAL EA mobile servers (expeditionary) installation on afloat units including MCM Class and LCS.- SSQ-94 System Trainer - Consists of an improved training systems to MCM Ships' integrating the SQQ-32 High Frequency Wide Band (HFWB) and SSN-2 PINS Upgrades and resolve obsolesence issues.

[P5 - 2 / LV078 - AN/SQQ-30(V)4 HFWB]: AN/SQQ-32(V)4 HFWB is a technology upgrade to the SQQ-32 Towed Body which will incorporate HFWB technology into the detection sonar to address performance deficiencies against new mine threats in the littorals. This upgrade will be installed on MCM-1 Class ships with the SQQ-32(V)3 and will have new transducer modules, fiber optic cable and modified topside processing and display software.

[P5 - 3 / LV079 - SMCM UUV W/LFBB (Knifefish)]: The Knifefish Surface Mine Countermeasure Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (SMCM UUV) (LV079) program procures Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to support clandestine mine detection capability against volume and bottom mines including buried mine detection. Equipment includes vehicles and associated systems support equipment.

[P5 - 3 / SMCM UUV (Knifefish)]: The Knifefish Surface Mine Countermeasure Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (SMCM UUV) program procures Unmanned Underwater Vehicles to support clandestine mine detection capability against volume and bottom mines including buried mine detection. Equipment includes vehicles and associated systems support equipment.

[P5 - 3 / LV080 - UNMANNED INFLUENCE SWEEP SYSTEM (UISS) Trainers]: Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) (LV080):  This line item procures the training units to support the UISS operational units procured for the Littoral Combat Ship Mission Modules. UISS consists of a Unmanned Surface Vehicle, power supply, control unit, winch, acoustic generator, magnetic tow cable, and a deploy and retrieve subsystem.  UISS will provide long endurance and wide area magnetic and acoustic mine sweep capability onboard the Littoral Combat Ship class of ships.

[P5 - 4 / LV085 - MAGNETIC SILENCING FACILITY UPGRADES]: This program is for hardware, auxiliary systems and support in association with the upgrade of the current aging CONUS and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Magnetic Silencing Facilities so the calibration of the new Open-Loop Magnetic Systems or Advanced Degaussing System ships and submarines can be accomplished for worldwide operation.  The upgrade will also ensure that the ships/submarines will be able to meet OPNAV 8950.2G signature requirements and will be less susceptible to Electro-Magnetic threat systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 funds the baseline program in order to outfit the current MCM Fleet with Navy's latest technology to combat Mine Warfare Countermeasures around the world. This includes the continued upgrades of SLQ-48 Mine Neutralization systems and the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) trainers. Additionally, to meet the increased operational demand, funding will go towards the installation of the MEDAL EA Mine Warfare Planning upgrades.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides a combination of US Navy projects planned to counter the threat to amphibious landing forces from known and projected foreign land/sea mines, obstacles in the beach zone and surf zone approaches to amphibious assault areas.  It is a system of systems (Countermine/Counter Obstacle, Intelligence/Surveillance/Reconnaissance/Targeting (ISR/T), Navigation/Virtual Marking/Integration, C4I/Data Fusion) to provide a full assault breaching capability.  This program is an essential element to the Marine Corps Ship To Objective Maneuver Concept of Operations.

This procurement line supports the COBRA program of record, delivering COBRA systems to Navy helicopter wings to provide initial proficiency training to Navy aircrews.  COBRA systems are also procured under BLI 1601 LCS Mission Modules.  The 1601 COBRA systems provide the deployable combat capability to LCS mission packages.

[P5 / SW004: COASTAL BATTLEFIELD RECONNAISSANCE AND ANALYSIS (COBRA)]: The mission of the AN/DVS-1 COBRA is to conduct unmanned aerial tactical reconnaissance in the littoral battlespace for detection and localization of minefields and obstacles in the surf zone and beach zone prior to an amphibious assault. The COBRA Airborne Payload will be carried on the MQ-8B Fire Scout.  This allows operators and other personnel to remain at a safe distance from the mine and obstacle belts and enemy direct and indirect fire. COBRA will be embarked in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as part of the Mine Countermeasures Mission Package (MP).

COBRA provides the (ISR/T) part of the Assault Breaching System of systems.  One system consists of two Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) Payloads and one Post Mission Analysis Station.  Under the umbrella of evolutionary acquisition, three increments of development are planned.  Block I introduces a daytime, surface laid minefield and obstacle detection capability for the Beach Zone.  Block II adds a surfzone and night (darkness) detection capability.  Block III adds a buried mine detection capability and on-board Near-Real-Time processing of Multi Spectral Imagery data.  COBRA will be a modular payload architecture of, and integrated with, the MQ-8B Fire Scout VTUAV and will serve as a "detect" sensor within the LCS Mine Warfare mission package as part of amphibious assault breaching.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 funding supports the baseline program which will procure one COBRA system to be integrated on the MQ-8B FIRESCOUT. These systems provide the fleet with the required training assets to certify the pilots and crew to operate and maintain these systems before being deployed on the LCS.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (NAVSTAR GPS) provides assured and protected navigation solutions to Warfighters through supported, affordable, and integrated systems, and is the primary source of positioning, navigation and timing information for the DoD.

[P3A / (1R0013) Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)]: NAVWAR ensures that U. S. military forces maintain access to the GPS in an electronically challenging battle space, delivers the capability to deny adversaries access to and use of GPS during military operations, and serves to preserve the peaceful use of GPS.  Navy GPS Enhanced User Equipment (UE) Operational Requirements Document  directs that future UE will incorporate an increased anti-jam capability.  NAVWAR counters the threat by increasing resistance to intentional or unintentional interference.  Sea NAVWAR Strategy comprises of 2 program increments, the first increment (near term) is to install GPS anti-jam antenna system (GAS-1) on surface platforms.  The second increment (long term) is to install Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) antennas on surface platforms.  The ADAP antenna improves upon GAS-1 performance by providing simultaneous dual frequency nulling, and built in test ability. Procurement and installation of anti-jam GPS antennas and modernized user equipment is required to ensure the continuation of GPS signals from space in a hostile jamming environment.  The Sea NAVWAR program will equip selected ships with anti-jam GPS antennas to ensure the continued availability of GPS to support surface combat operations and provide reliable GPS and other positioning, navigation and timing data to ship-board Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance(C4ISR), Combat, and Weapons Systems.

[P3A - 2 / (1R019) Global Positioning System (GPS) - based positioning, Navigation, &amp; Timing Service (GPNTS)]: The GPS-based PNT Service (GPNTS) system is the primary PNT system for the Navy to ensure reliable PNT capability and interoperability insertion in GPS receivers and associated Command, Control, Computers, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) and combat systems in a denied environment. GPNTS provides precise PNT data required for combat, weapons, command, control, communications, navigation, and other systems, as well as providing the time synchronization critical to the network environments. GPNTS backfits current PNT/GPS systems and forward fit new platforms. GPNTS will host the Air Force GPS Directorate-developed Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) card, allowing access to the new more accurate and secure GPS Military-Code (M-Code) signal. GPNTS provides more robust and secure GPS/PNT capabilities than is currently in the Fleet.  The system provides the capability to migrate non-real time GPS data toward a Common Computing Environment (CCE) and provide a path for the integration of advanced navigation systems and sensors.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) - Sea NAVWAR will procure and field dual ADAP FOAL antennas in FY18.

GPS-based Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) Service (GPNTS) program will procure and field Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units in FY18.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>K0001:  American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) Program - AFRTS shipboard systems provide command information to deployed Sailors and Marines and allow for the distribution of AFRTS programming in order to provide situational awareness for forward deployed commanders with real-time news and information.  The systems also provide programming to Sailors and Marines at sea worldwide as a Navy Quality of Life (QOL) initiative, staying in compliance with the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Shipboard Habitability Program. These systems contribute significantly to the habitability of Navy ships by providing and distributing news, command information, training, and entertainment programming using the latest technology available. These systems improve morale, combat effectiveness and retention rates of deployed personnel.  All AFRTS systems use Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment.

            <proc:Description>Funding in this P-1 line provides Non-Propulsion Electronics equipment that will be installed aboard TRIDENT Class submarines as part of the Obsolete Equipment Replacement (OER) Program.

OER Program is the replacement of existing hardware/software that, though functional, has become operationally obsolete, is no longer in production or supportable with spare parts, or has a high failure rate making them no longer cost effective to maintain.  OER hardware/software changes are expected to provide significant cost savings via reduced maintenance costs and use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology wherever possible as long as all technical requirements are met.

This funding line includes performance of the required fully integrated system level testing and certification of changes to the TRIDENT Combat systems prior to installation of the changes on the ship.  Integrated testing and certification provides assurance that when the changes are installed in the ship, the TRIDENT Combat system will operate as designed, allowing the ships to maintain their operational schedules and mission capabilities.

[P40A / CCS Revision Engineering Cert/Test]: This program develops upgrades to legacy systems to maintain required interface connectivity to other Program Acquisition Resource Manager (PARM)-managed subsystems in response to PARMs modernizations, or to address obsolescence, or where mandated requirement changes (example Cyber security) drive changes to hardware or software.</proc:Description>

[P40A / MB050 SUBMARINE SONAR TRAINERS]: MB050 SUBMARINE SONAR TRAINERS

The Sonar Employment Trainer (SET) provides acoustic operator employment Fleet and team training for submarine sonar systems.  It uses entirely commercial components to contain contact and environment models, simulations of the sensors and signal processing, simulated operator consoles, and an instructional subsystem including an instructor's console.  SET is used to train advanced operators in the Advanced Sonar Employment and Sonar Supervisor courses.  The SET is periodically upgraded to support current software Advanced Processor Builds (APBs) and Technical Insertions (TIs).  The SET is an essential component of an emerging shore based training that supports the projected technology in the Fleet systems that are designed to meet current and future threats:  the Acoustics, Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (A-RCI).   

The SET is part of the solution to increasing operator competence and data recognition through employment training by its use of 3-D graphics, animation, audio, and scientific visualization methods to illustrate highly complex displays and concepts of oceanographic physics.  The demands of curriculum and student throughout at the primary submarine training site at NAVSUBSCOL, Groton dictates the number and configuration of trainers provided. 

FY15: Procures one kit and implements simulation upgrades to the SET as directed by the Type Commander.

FY16: Procures one kit and implements simulation upgrades to the SET as directed by the Type Commander.

            <proc:Description>Efforts for Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (MATCALS), National Air Space System (NASMOD), Fleet Air Traffic Control (ATC) Systems and Landing Systems were previously funded under BLSs 2815, 2840, 2845 and 2846, respectively.  Subject budgets are consolidated into Ashore ATC Equipment, BLI 2820 effective FY2017. 

MATCALS
Marine Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (MATCALS) provides for continuous, all-weather, radar/non-radar approach, departure, enroute, and tower air traffic control services to aircraft.  Marine ATC provides initial, transition and sustained air traffic support for the Joint and Marine Air Ground Task Force air operations in any environment.  MATCALS satisfies the operational requirements set forth by Specific Operational Requirements 34-22 of 12 Jul 1973; Remote Landing Site Tower (RLST) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) 341-88-93 of 25 Jul 1997; and Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System ORD 05-002 of 03 Dec 1992. MATCALS, with other Marine Air Command and Control Systems (MACCS) and federal agencies, provides the ability to project air combat power without regard to weather.  Air Traffic Control (ATC) automation reduces air traffic controllers' traffic handling and management time, allowing more time for mission response and task accomplishment.  It supports a required increase in aircraft sortie rates and contributes to extended time on target.   The system provides for integration of ATC into the total MACCS.  To provide this capability, MATCALS consists of 6 primary subsystems: (1) Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination system (ATNAVICS) AN/TPX-31(V); (2) Tactical Terminal Communication System (TTCS) AN/TSQ-263; (3) Expeditionary Control Tower AN/TSQ-120C; (4) RLST AN/TSQ-216; (5)Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) AN/TRN-44; (6) the Man-Portable TACAN AN/TRN-47(V)1, and various ancillary equipment.  The ATNAVICS Air Surveillance Radar (ASR) Range Extension is funded to meet requirements identified in the ATC Initial Capabilities Document ICD (ICD), MROC DM 75-7007, MACC Operational Advisory Group.  The gaps identified require sustainment of legacy sensor capability until such time as ATNAVICS PrePlanned Product Improvement initiatives enhance system capability to support main air base traffic density and airspace.  Additionally, the positive control enabled by increased ASR range reduces separation enabling increased sortie rates.  This program works with the Marine ATC Working Group identifying the requirements to implement the P3I and evolutionary product improvements as required for G/ATOR system, ATNAVICS, Expeditionary ATC Towers, and Navigational Aids that support Marine Air Traffic Control Detachments. G/ATOR is multi-role, ground-based, expeditionary radar that replaces five legacy radar systems for the Marine Air Ground Task Force.  It satisfies the Marine Air Command and Control System and the Ground Counter Fire/ Counter Battery capabilities.

NASMOD
The Joint DoD/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Airspace System (NAS) Modernization (MOD) program upgrades the DoD ATC systems at approach control facilities in concert with the FAA's upgrade of the National ATC System. These funds will procure ATC systems for the Navy/Marine ATC facilities.  The Air Force is the DoD lead activity for the Joint Acquisition Program. The Joint Program Office is located at Hanscom AFB, MA.  The NAS Mod program received a full rate production decision on 7 June 2005 and is in the production and deployment phase following Milestone C.


FLEET ATC SYSTEMS
NAVAIR provides shore based ATC terminal facilities with equipment that is required in joint efforts to efficiently and safely monitor and direct military and commercial air traffic in national and international air space. Many of these systems are required to interface through automated means with the FAA.  Additionally, NAVAIR has material support responsibility for Special Instrumentation Systems, and Ancillary Equipment used at Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Shore activities in the continental United States and overseas.

Engineering Change Proposal (ECP)/Operational Capability Improvement Request (OCIR) modernization (MR069) - The ECP/OCIR program provides for the procurement and/or modification of critically needed communications, radar, displays, data processors, and other electronic systems/equipment at Navy/Marine Corps ATC facilities worldwide. ECP/OCIR procurements replace and modernize costly-to-maintain systems and equipment in order to increase ATC efficiency and safety, and reduce total ownership costs.

UHF/VHF Antenna Upgrade (MR404) - This program procures and installs antenna, antenna towers, and antenna cables

Communications Systems Upgrade Program (MR408) - This program procures and installs advanced commercial state-of-the-art ATC voice switching equipment.


UHF/VHF Transceiver Replacement Program (MR440) - This program modernizes aging Navy and Marine Corps UHF/VHF Transceivers that are the central core of all ATC emergency and Fleet Area Control &amp; Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) communications.

Emergency Communication System (ECS) Upgrade Program (MR445) - This program modernizes obsolete and unsupportable ECS equipment. Voice Switches, Recorders, Reproducers, Uninterruptable Power Supplies, and Built-In Test Equipment will be replaced with modern, supportable components.


Air Field Lighting Control System (AFLCS) (MR510) - This program modernizes obsolete and unsupportable AFLCS equipment which will be replaced with modern, supportable components.  Funding for this effort was realigned to the Terminal Automation System (TAS) CB070 beginning in FY18.  The TAS provides the functionality and meets the requirements of the airfield lighting control as prescribed in the NASMOD ORD III Airfield Automation Annex A dated 16MAR05.

Operational Communication System (OCS)/Emergency Communication System (ECS) Air Traffic Control (ATC) Recorder replacement program (MR520), through participation in the FAA ATC recorder replacement program will replace aging and obsolete ATC OCS and ECS ATC recorders with state of the art ATC recording/reproducing technology.

Fiber Optic Communications Intersite System (FOCIS) Upgrade Program (MR530) - FOCIS is required for Precision Approach Radar (PAR) operations and for ATC voice communications at Naval and Marine Corps ATC facilities. This program modernizes obsolete and unsupportable FOCIS equipment with modern supportable components.
 

LANDING SYSTEMS
     Landing Systems budget provides funding to modernize and ensure the reliability of Precision Approach Radars (PAR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) systems, Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), and other air navigation aids used by the Navy and Marine Corps.
     PAR Commercial-off-the-shelf (AN/FPN-68A) Upgrade replaces obsolete PAR systems (AN/FPN-63) continuing fleet shore based Precision Approach capability. Additionally PAR (AN/FPN-63) ECPs are required to sustain the existing systems until replacement.  Those ECPs include but are not limited to the Modulator Board Upgrade, the Antenna Upgrade, the Configuration Upgrade, the Turntable Upgrade, the Fiber Optic Inter-site System (FOIS), and the Angle Voltage Generator (AVG) Upgrade.
    TACAN Ship/Shore Upgrade ECPs update old technology and extend the service life of the TACAN. The TACAN sustainment consists of the Antenna Upgrade ECP for the OE-273 antenna (nomenclature for the new antenna TBD) and the Beacon Upgrade ECP of the AN/URN-25 which will make the upgraded Beacon an AN/URN-32.
     Instrument Landing Systems (nomenclature TBD after contract award) will provide the Navy and Marine Corps with a self-contained Precision Landing capability at selected Air Stations, to meet fleet requirements for safe aircraft recovery of aircraft equipped with ILS capabilities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>MATCALS
     FY2018 provides funding to procure Maintainability/Reliability Improvements, 1 ATNAVICS Range Extensions, and 3 AMTACs.

NASMOD
     The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative in FY2008.  A major component of this capability is Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, which will provide aircraft position information to augment ground-based radar.  Existing DoD Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities interface with FAA's facilities, therefore the military must maintain interoperability and retain vital special-use airspace for combat readiness training. The DoD Advanced Automation System (DAAS) must be upgraded to meet this requirement.
     FY2018 provides funding to procure 1 DoD Advanced Automation Systems, 8 STARS Tech Refresh Upgrades, 5 TAS Tech Refresh, 618 NAS Voice System Radios, various Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and associated support.

The Air Traffic Navigation Integration and Coordination System (ATNAVICS) Air Surveillance Radar (ASR) Range Extension is funded to meet requirements indentified in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Initial Capabilities Document, Marine Requirements Oversite Committee Decision Memorandum 75-7007, Marine Aviation Command and Control Operational Advisory Group and Headquarters Marine Corps APX-25 Requirement Clarification letter dated 05 Jan 2010.  The gaps identified require sustainment of legacy sensor capability until such time as ATNAVICS PrePlanned Product Improvement initiatives enhance system capability to support main air base traffic density and airspace.  Additionally, the positive control enabled by increased ASR range reduces separation enabling increased sortie rates.  The End Item Kits for the ATNAVICS ASR Range Extension that are being procured consist of: ASR transmitter, environmental control unit/power generator, Radio Frequency transmission line, ASR receiver/exciter and signal data processors and required software code modifications to system Lowest Repairable Units.  

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2815.</proc:Remarks>

The TAS was developed as part of a joint DoD)/ FAA program to modernize and standardize ATC equipment in the National Airspace System.  The TAS has enabled Navy ATC facilities to replace aging, obsolete equipment and comply with joint DoD/FAA modernization program agreements.  Inventory objective of 57 TAS.

This effort includes Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) efforts directly related to the TAS Tech Refresh efforts detailed in cost element CB070 of this budget.  The ECP introduces new capability into a common workstation that eliminates a separate visual communications alert indicator.  The nature of that consolidation creates an interdependency with CB070; which addresses severe obsolescence issues that render the current workstation configuration unsupportable.  Both software and hardware for these two cost elements overlap and require concurrent efforts.  Delay or interruption to either CB040 and/or CB070 causes a break in fleet capability and negatively impacts both flight safety and operator workload.

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2840.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Added Capability

The Tower Automation Systems have been fielded since 2001 and are experiencing obsolescence and Information Assurance (IA) issues.  These upgrades will address these obsolescence and IA issues as well as maintain compatibility with the FAA's Next Generation (NextGen) Air Transporation System initiatives.  Additionally, these upgrades will enhance system performance to provide Common Access Card utilization, multi-source weather reporting and Tactical Air Control Navigation (TACAN) control.  In order to achieve the modernization of the National Air Space (NAS) envisioned by NextGen, the FAA is developing a Terminal Flight Data Management (TFDM) platform that integrates flight data systems and decision support tools.  The TFDM program is an integrated approach to maximize the efficient collection, distribution, and update of data and improve access to information necessary for the safe and efficient control of air traffic.  The TAS will be upgraded to be consistent with the FAA TFDM.

This effort includes TAS Tech Refresh efforts directly related to the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) efforts detailed in cost element CB040 of this budget.  The ECP introduces new capability into a common workstation that eliminates a separate visual communications (VISCOM) alert indicator.  The nature of that consolidation creates an interdependency with CB040; which addresses severe obsolescence issues that render the current workstation configuration unsupportable.  Both software and hardware for these two cost elements overlap and require concurrent efforts.  Delay or interruption to either CB040 and/or CB070 causes a break in fleet capability and negatively impacts both flight safety and operator workload.

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2840.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Added Capability

FAA NAS Voice System(NVS) was a new start in FY 2015 and a forward-looking program to replace national airspace system (NAS) voice switches and radios with a new technology system capable of supporting future requirements for the NextGen.  Many of these switches are experiencing increasing obsolescence and failures and are in need of replacement. They are not capable of supporting flexible reallocation of access to communications resources, and lack security needed for a network-based communications infrastructure, which is a key concept in modernization of the NAS. The NVS program will provide a key transitional element in the air traffic control voice communications infrastructure as it moves toward realizing the FAAs NextGen vision and a more operationally efficient and economic NAS.

Radios:  There are 75 sites which will receive a total of 4,498 radios.  The sites to receive radios include FACSFACs remote sites at Naval and Marine Corps Air Stations.  The number of radios per site varies due to operational requirements and the number of aircraft serviced. 

Voice Switches:  There are two specific types of Voice Switches being procured: Operational Communication System (OCS) and Emergency Control System (ECS):  56 OCS Voice Switches, 42 ECS Voice Switches.  

42 Sites will receive both an OCS Voice Switch and an ECS Voice Switch, 14 sites will receive only an OCS voice switch.  While FACSFAC remote sites are equipped with radios, they are not equipped with Voice Switches. 

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2840.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Reliability

This Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) constitutes Block 2 and 3 of the Service Life Extension Program for the AN/FPN-63. It will extend the service life to at least 2025 by replacing obsolete receiver/transmitter assemblies, radar video processors, and controller displays with state-of-the-art assemblies/displays. This upgrade will also correct numerous human factors issues. This ECP will be accomplished on 36 deployed AN/FPN-63 Precision Approach Radar (PAR) Systems.

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2846.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Modernization

The TACAN Antenna Upgrade program will provide ships and shore installations with a new antenna for TACAN systems. Justification: TACAN is a dated systems with multiple obsolete parts. Modernization of the TACAN antenna is required to reduce  maintenance and improve life span in order to meet needs of the Fleet, and provide a stand-alone recovery system in the wake of the JPALS program restructure.

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2846.</proc:Remarks>

Support cost fluctuations are due to variations in Naval Air Station / Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility requirements, and Marine Corps Air Station mission requirements.  (3) Installation costs fluctuate based on location of  installation and the tailoring of systems to meet Naval Air Station / Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility requirements, and Marine Corps Air Station mission requirements.  Decrease in inventory objective due to incorrect system count.  8 remote tower configuration were inadvertently counted as full STARS Tech Refresh systems and not as part of the parent facility STARS Tech Refresh System.  Remote towers will be procured as part of the parent facility.  Additionally, NAS Willow Grove and NAS Brunswick were included in the inventory objective.  NAS Willow Grove and NAS Brunswick were disestablished in 2011 as part of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).">2.1.1) End Item - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>The Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) is a joint (DoD) and Department of Transportation FAA program to modernize terminal air traffic control automation systems. The STARS contract was awarded by the FAA on September 16, 1996, and ends September 30, 2017.  The FAA anticipates the award of a contract for system maintenance, system technical refresh, and system enhancements through fiscal year 2019.   The FAA began the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative in FY2008.  A major component of this capability is Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, which will provide aircraft position information in place of ground-based radar.  The DoD version of STARS DAAS must be upgraded to meet this requirement. Inventory objective is 38.

Procurements, installations and associated support costs for this effort prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2840.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Efforts for Shipboard Air Traffic Control (SATC) and Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) were previously funded under BLIs OPN 2831 and OPN 2832, respectively.  Beginning in FY 2017, this consolidated line item (OPN 2830, Afloat ATC Equipment) continues efforts previously executed under OPN 2831 and OPN 2832 and is not considered a new start.  

DESCRIPTION:
Shipboard Air Traffic Control (SATC):
     SATC systems are responsible for safe and expeditious control of air traffic within 50 Nautical Miles of a ship.  SATC systems include the air traffic surveillance radar (ASR), AN/SPN43 and the air traffic control processing and display system, AN/TPX-42A(V), which has three major configurations: AN/TPX-42A(V)14/15/16. v14 and v16 configurations comprise of Carrier Air Traffic Control Center - Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (CATCC-DAIR), Amphibious Air Traffic Control Center - Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (AATCC-DAIR); both (V)14 and (V)16 DAIR systems use AN/SPN-43 and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) inputs to track and control aircraft.  The third configuration, AN/TPX-42A(V)15 interfaces with next generation multipurpose radars and IFF to perform the same mission. Obsolescence problems are being addressed through various upgrades in a phased approach.  The major upgrades include a series of AN/TPX-42A(V) modification kits requiring various combinations of  OL-541processor rehost, track processor upgrade, OD-220  console, audio/video recorder, flat panel display, embedded trainer, and other components to bring the AN/TPX-42A(V)14  system to AN/TPX-42A(V)16  configuration and eventually to the Air Traffic Control Multifunction Console configuration.  The ASR capability provided by the AN/SPN-43 radar system is required for the service-life of CVNs and LHA/LHD class ships.  Obsolescence problems are being addressed through various upgrades in a phased approach until the capability is replaced by the AN/SPN-50 Shipboard Air Traffic Radar.


Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS):
      ACLS program comprises three legacy systems (AN/SPN-46, AN/SPN-41, and AN/SPN-35C) that provide the primary and secondary precision electronic guidance for landing suitably equipped aircraft under all weather conditions on CVNs, LHA/LHD class ships, and selected Naval Air Stations. Many of the components in the system have been in service for more than twenty years. This program funds maintainability, reliability, modernization and supportability improvements to existing equipment components that can no longer be maintained, procured or supported, as well as items providing upgraded operational capability. Life Cycle Extension (LCE) sustainment efforts for ACLS systems will be completed to address obsolescence and supportability issues, leverage Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology, address cyber-security updates and requirements, and support external system interface requirements. The LCE efforts by systemare planned to be conducted in blocks, to address the most critical obsolescence, supportability, and emergent requirements first and to group remaining improvements into logical block upgrade packages that minimize multiple,duplicative repair efforts and reduce costs while delivering hardware in a time phased approach to meet ship maintenance availability schedules.

AN/SPN-46 Precision Approach Landing System (PALS) provides aircraft position information to the Final Control Workstation in Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC), and provides the pilot with the capability of selecting
a fully automatic, instrument landing, or talk down approach. This system is certified to provide the carrier with an all-weather flight operational capability. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the AN/SPN-46 was in 1985, and
the system has exceeded its design life. There are significant obsolescence issues. AN/SPN-46 Block IV upgrade is designed to correct known obsolescence issues in the antenna pedestal, 50KW Ka band modulator/transmitter, and
various Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs). If this effort is not accomplished, replacement parts will not be available to support the system, thereby, negatively affecting Operational Availability (Ao) and safety of flight on the aircraft
carrier.

AN/SPN-41 Transmitting set provides all weather instrument approach guidance from the ship to the aircraft equipped with AN/ARA-63 Receiver Group. It is a secondary precision electronic landing system and safety of flight back
up to provide azimuth and elevation alignment information to suitably equipped aircraft aboard CVN and LHA/LHD class ships. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the AN/SPN-41 was in 1970 and the system has exceeded its design life. AN/SPN-41 LCE upgrades include the Transmitter, Coder, Electronics Drawer, and Radome hardware to ensure continued operational availability of and extended the service life of the AN/SPN-41, and is the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) back-up system. 

AN/SPN-35C is the Precision Approach Radar aboard LHA/LHD class ships and is used for Mode III aircraft recovery which ensures the safe approach and landing of AV-8B and various helicopters during adverse weather and night
conditions. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the AN/SPN-35C was in 2004. The AN/SPN-35C Block I upgrade includes replacement of common failure items, obsolete components, and analog system components, including
the Radar Processor Controller (RPC), the Main Input/Output Processor (MIOP), and replace some obsolete Control-Indicator Displays to ensure continued operational availability of and extended the service life of the AN/SPN-35C.

Procurement, installations and associated support costs with these efforts prior to FY2017 were funded under BLI 2832.

Type Modification: Reliability

The equipment and installation costs on this P-3a are for individual modifications part of the AN/SPN-46 Life Cycle Extension program. The current AN/SPN-46 receiver houses both Ka and X-band components that are densely
packaged and RF components that are obsolete technology and are no longer manufactured. The Radar Set Group re-packages the RF components using more modern and smaller components making the unit able to be supported and maintained. The inventory objective for this item is 13, of which 11 are OPN-funded and 2 SCN-funded.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Modernization

AN/SPN-41 Transmitter MOD (LCE) PN416. The equipment and installation costs on this P-3a are for individual modification programs though it must be installed in conjunction with ECP SPN41-030 and SPN41-034 in order to be
fully functional as part of the AN/SPN-41 Life Cycle Extension (LCE) program. The existing transmitter is an older technology two-channel Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) line type modulator that is experiencing maintainability and obsolescence issues. The transmitter is the number one maintenance cost driver and system performance degrader. This change will improve logistic supportability and system maintainability. Line Repairable Units (LRUs) Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) and Built-In Test (BIT) capabilities will be incorporated in the transmitter thus reducing cost for shipboard repairs and maintenance.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Modernization

AN/SPN-41 Radome Hardware Upgrade (LCE) PN419. The equipment and installation costs on this P-3a are for individual modification programs. This is part of the AN/SPN-41 Life Cycle Extension program. This change will
improve overall AN/SPN-41/41A Operational Availability (Ao) by addressing extreme environmental issues currently being experienced by the systems in the field. This change increases overall thermal resistance while
decreasing solar absorptivity thereby reducing the ambient operating temperature for the equipment inside the radome, prolonging component life and reducing failure rates.</proc:Remarks>

Identify and replace the current SPN-46 EGI GPS units aboard ship which are experiencing extremely high failure issues and low reliability throughout the Fleet. 3. Establish and purchase an alternate cooling system for the SPN-46 to replace the Vortex Chiller currently in use which has supportability issues in the Fleet. 4.

Assemblies (CCAs). This effort is designed to extend the supportability of the AN/SPN-46 beyond its current design life that is exceeded. If this effort is not accomplished, replacement parts will not be available to support the
fielded AN/SPN-46 systems, thereby, negatively affecting Operational Availability (Ao) and safety of flight on the aircraft carrier. The inventory objective for this item is 16.

[AN/SPN-46 Block IV] The AN/SPN-46(V) Precision Approach Landing System (PALS)provides aircraft position information to the Final Control Workstation in Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC), and provides the pilot with the capability of selecting a fully automatic, instrument landing, or talk down approach.  This system is certified to provide the carrier with an all-weather flight operational capability.  This system is operational in all weather conditions with minimal degradation due to sea state.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the AN/SPN-46(V) was in 1985, and the system has exceeded its design life.  There are significant obsolescence issues.  Block IV is designed to correct known  obsolescence issues in the antenna pedestal, 50KW Ka band modulator/transmitter, and various Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs). This effort is designed to extend the supportability of the AN/SPN-46(V) to the 2040 timeframe.  If this effort is not accomplished, replacement parts will not be available to support the system, thereby, negatively affecting Operational Availability (Ao) and safety of flight on the aircraft carrier. The inventory objective for this item is 16.  PMA-213 configuration control board approves inventory objectives.</proc:Description>

DESCRIPTION:  Shipboard Air Traffic Control (SATC) systems are responsible for safe and expeditious control of air traffic within 50 Nautical Miles of a ship.  SATC systems include the air traffic surveillance radar, AN/SPN-43, and the air traffic central tracking and control system, AN/TPX-42, which has two major configurations: Carrier Air Traffic Control Center-Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (CATCC-DAIR) and Amphibious Air Traffic Control Center-Direct Altitude and Identity Readout (AATCC-DAIR).  Both DAIR systems use AN/SPN-43 and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) inputs to track and control aircraft.  Obsolescence problems are being addressed through various upgrades in a phased approach.  The major upgrades include a series of AN/TPX-42 modification kits requiring various combinations of AN/UYK-44 processor rehost, track processor upgrade, AN/UYQ-70 console, audio recorder, flat panel display, and other components to bring the predecessor system to AN/TPX-42A(V)14 with field changes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 configuration and eventually to the Air Traffic Control Multifunction Console configuration.  The AN/SPN-43 radar system is required for the service-life of CVN68-CVN77 &amp; LHA/LHD class ships with no replacement system identified.

            <proc:Description>Beginning in FY 2017, effort continues in OPN Line Item 2830, Afloat ATC Equipment

The Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) provides the primary precision electronic guidance for landing aircraft under all weather conditions on CVNs, LHAs, LHDs and selected Naval Air Stations.  Many of the components in the system have been in service for more than twenty years.  This program funds maintainability, reliability and supportability improvements to existing equipment components that can no longer be maintained and supported, as well as items providing upgraded operational capability.  AN/SPN-46 Life Cycle Extension (LCE) sustainment efforts will be supplemented with other changes, as necessary, to offset obsolescence and supportability issues, the need for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) refresh, and to support system interface requirements.  LCE efforts include Radar Control Group Unit 19, Embedded Global Positioning System and Inertial Navigation System (EGI) replacement, Computer Group replacement, Radar Receiver set replacement, Peripheral Display replacement, and Common Console replacement efforts.  AN/SPN-41 LCE sustainment efforts will be supplemented with other changes, as necessary, to offset obsolescence and supportability issues and to support systems interface requirements.  Additionally, the AN/SPN-41 system is the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) back-up system.

            <proc:Description>The Joint DoD/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Airspace System (NAS) Modernization (MOD) program upgrades the DoD Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems at Approach Control Facilities in concert with the FAA's upgrade of the National ATC System.   These funds will procure ATC systems for the Navy/Marine ATC facilities.

The Air Force is the DoD lead activity for the Joint Acquisition Program.  The Joint Program Office is located at Hanscom AFB, MA.

The NAS Mod program received a full rate production decision on 7 June 2005 and is in the production and deployment phase following Milestone C.

*Prior years total includes funding associated with cost elements no longer funded by this program.

Funding for procurements, support costs and associated installs for FY2017 and beyond have been realigned to Ashore ATC Equipment (BLI 2820).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative in FY2008.  A major component of this capability is Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, which will provide aircraft position information to augment ground-based radar.  Existing DoD Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities interface with FAA's facilities, therefore the military must maintain interoperability and retain vital special-use airspace for combat readiness training. The DoD Advanced Automation System must be upgraded to meet this requirement.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) tasked Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) with the requirement to provide shore based Air Traffic Control (ATC) terminal facilities and equipment that are required to efficiently and safely monitor and direct military and commercial air traffic in national and international air space.  Many of these systems are required to interface through automated means with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  Additionally, NAVAIR has material support responsibility for Air Navigation Aid Systems, Mobile ATC Equipment, Special Instrumentation Systems, and Ancillary Equipment used for ATC and Landing Systems (LS) by the Navy and Marine Corps.  This Landing Systems program, in conjunction with the Fleet ATC Systems and the National Airspace System Modernization program provide the three pillars by which the Navy supports and meets established requirements to modernize and ensure reliable, safe and effective operations of ATC &amp; LS used at the Navy and Marine Corps air stations worldwide.

Landing Systems budget provides funding to modernize and ensure the reliability of Precision Approach Radars (PAR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) systems, Instrument Landing System (ILS), and other air navigation aids used by the Navy and Marine Corps.

PAR Commercial-off-the-shelf (FPN-68) Upgrade replaces obsolete PAR systems (FPN-63) continuing fleet shore based Precision Approach capability. Additionally PAR (FPN-63) ECP's  consist of the Modulator Board Upgrade ECP, the Antenna Upgrade ECP, the Configuration Upgrade ECP, the Turntable Upgrade ECP, the Fiber Optic Inter-site System (FOIS) ECP, the Angle Voltage Generator (AVG) Upgrade ECP, and the Technology Refresh Upgrade ECP currently known as PAR COTs. These ECPs will extend the life of the FPN-63 until they are replaced, by the FPN-68.
TACAN Upgrade ECPs update old technology and extend the service life of the TACAN. The TACAN sustainment consists of the Antenna Upgrade ECP, the Shelter Upgrade ECP and the Beacon Upgrade ECP.
ILS Systems provide the Navy and Marine Corps with a self-contained Precision Landing capability at selected Air Stations, to meet fleet requirements for safe aircraft recovery.

            <proc:Description>FY 2018 funding request reflect a reduction of $3.074 million to account for the availability of prior year funds.

The Identification Systems program funds procurements, installations, and certifications for the following systems: AN/UPX-37, AN/UPX-41, and AN/UPX-45 Digital Interrogators, AN/APX-118 and AN/APX-123 Common Digital Transponder, AN/UPX-29 Interrogator System (comprised of the Interrogator Set AN/UPX-24, OE-120()/UPX Antenna Group, and Mark XII or Mark XIIA equipment), Mark XIIA Mode 5, Identification Friend Foe (IFF) support equipment,  AN/UPX-34A Radar Track Discriminator System, and AN/URN-25 Ship Tactical Air Navigation.

The Air Traffic Control Radio Beacon System, IFF, Mark XII/XIIA System AIMS is a DoD directed tri-service program designed to provide a universal air traffic control radar beacon system compatible with the National Airspace System Program. It provides a secure identification system for military use on all combatant ships, selected auxiliaries, patrol craft, and selected Coast Guard ships by allowing all friendly forces to identify each other and neutral forces. The Mark XII/XIIA system supports several missions such as anti-air warfare, aerial bombardment, and naval attack.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The purpose of the AN/UPX-37 and AN/UPX-41(C) Digital Interrogators (DI) and AN/APX-118 and AN/APX-123 Common Digital Transponder (CXP) program is to replace 20-25 year old hardware and software with reliability and maintenance enhancements through the use of Commercial Off The Shelf / Non Developmental Item COTS/NDI form/fit/function improvements.  Incorporation of the Mark XIIA (Mode 5) capability occurred in FY08 and changes nomenclatures from AN/UPX-37 and AN/APX-118(V) to AN/UPX-41(C) and AN/APX-123(V), respectively.   Incorporation of the Mark XIIA (Mode S) capability into the AN/UPX-41(C) DI is currently ongoing and will change the DI nomenclature from AN/UPX-41(C) to AN/UPX-45(C).

AN/UPX-24(V) Field Changes will provide hardware updates to accommodate Mode 5 and Mode S functionality in fielded systems.  AN/UPX-24(V) Mode S upgrades will provide improved shipboard combat identification by increasing the probability of identification of commercial and neutral aircraft.  The AN/UPX-29(V) Interrogator System is deployed on high capability, state of the art surface platforms that require IFF operational performance beyond that provided by a standard Mark XII system for combat identification.  Mark XIIA Mode 5 and Mode S provide improved secure cooperative combat identification throughout IFF. Mode 5 and Mode S are product improvements designed to be installed through engineering changes to digital Mark XII interrogators and transponders including AN/APX-118/123(V), AN/UPX-37/41(C), and AN/UPX-24(V). 

Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) Beacon Upgrade funds a replacement of 1970s technology and eliminates pending parts obsolescence.</proc:Justification>

Type Modification: Reliability

Current Mark XII transponder systems no longer meet operational reliability and maintainability (R&amp;M) requirements due to use beyond their intended life cycle and they suffer a high cost of ownership due to parts obsolescence.  Current surface ship Mark XII transponders will be replaced to continue incremental digital and R&amp;M upgrades to the Mark XII IFF system. The common digital transponder uses an open architecture that allows for future growth, including Mode 5 (AN/APX-123(V)) and Mode S which was incorporated into the production line beginning with the FY 2005 procurement. Inventory Objective of 375 is derived from the Naval Data Environment (NDE) database, the Ships &amp; Aircraft Supplemental Data Table (SASDT) and ship/submarine Ship Program Manager (SPM) procurement plans and schedules. Incorporation of the Mark XIIA (Mode 5) capability occurred in FY08 and changed the nomenclature from AN/APX-118(V) to AN/APX-123(V). LRIP AN/APX-123(V) units were installed and operated in legacy-only modes until successful completion of the Mode 5 OPEVAL (MT037) and Full Rate Production decision. Full Rate Production was approved July 2012.</proc:Remarks>

Type Modification: Capability Improvement

Adds Mode Select (S) Beacon System commercial aircraft interrogation capability to shipboard IFF Digital Interrogators (DIs).  Incorporation of a Mode S capability in the AN/UPX-41(C) will result in a nomenclature change to AN/UPX-45(C).  In some installations, such as Aircraft Carriers, incorporation of the Mode S capability in the DI will include an interface with a ship's Air Traffic Control System. Mode S provides improved aircraft surveillance and communications necessary to support air traffic control automation in the dense traffic environments. Mode S provides more accurate aircraft positional information and minimizes interference by discrete interrogation of each Mode S transponder-equipped aircraft and improved processing of aircraft replies. In addition, Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link, which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases. Inventory Objective of 321 is derived from the Naval Data Environment database, the Ships &amp; Aircraft Supplemental Data Table and ship/submarine Ship Program Manager procurement plans and schedules.</proc:Remarks>

Hardware unit costs include ancillary equipment throughout the FYDP.  The number of kits and necessary ancillary hardware required is dependent upon the class of ship; therefore unit costs fluctuate from year to year based on the number of installs planned for the following year(s).  Delta between procurements and installations is due to the (procurement only) Naval Special Warfare units.  The Support Equipment (SE) line consists of buying USM-719 (Test Sets) and KIV-78 (crypto appliques).  Deliveries occur on a sliding basis, beginning 12 months after contract award and completing 24 months.  Install of equipment can not occur until receipt of all 3 pieces of equipment have been delivered from manufacturer.  Install costs vary from year to year due to ship availability, ship classification and location of the install.  Hardware requirements vary based ship classifications.  Inventory Objectives are as follows:  Mode 5 CXP kits is 427, Mode 5 UPX-24(V) Kits is 110, and Mode 5 DI Kits is 293.

Deliveries from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) commence 12 months after contract award and conclude 24 months after award (i.e. the delivery date on the P-3a is the date of the first delivery, not the date when all items are delivered); installations then occur within the allotted 12 months from when each kit is delivered.  Once delivered, additional efforts are required by the In-Service Engineering Activity to produce ready for issue units from kits, and build and test complete systems with ancillary hardware prior to fleet installs.">BAE Systems LP</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>This line item provides funding to procure Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) workstations, Software/Production Engineering Support and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS).  JMPS is the Chief of Naval Operation's (CNO) designated automated mission planning system for the Navy, supporting over 40 T/M/S.  Future JMPS platforms include: MQ-4C (Triton), P-8, C/KC-130,and CH-53K.  JMPS enables weapon system employment by providing the information and decision aids needed to rapidly plan aircraft, weapon or sensor missions, load mission data into aircraft and weapons, conduct mission rehearsal and post mission analysis.  JMPS consists of two types of workstations - Maritime (JMPS-M) and Expeditionary (JMPS-E).  JMPS-M is the primary product within the Naval Mission Planning System (NavMPS).  The Navy's modern aircraft need data loaded from JMPS-M to fly their missions.  As weapons become increasingly advanced, they will require increased quantity and fidelity of data to support mission planning.  These data requirements will require additional advanced processors and greater amounts of continuous memory.  JMPS-M flight planning seats refer to the computer workstations that employ the JMPS framework software.  JMPS-E is a tailorable and collaborative web-based mission planning system for the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON).  Program cost is not directly related to FY hardware quantity; software is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost.  Funding profile accounts for required four year workstations refresh to preclude aging hardware, increased failure rates, emerging technology; such as Electronic Kneeboard (EKB) and increased memory requirements.  

Prior to FY17, the EKB was funded in BLI 4268.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Items to be funded in this line include:

Workstation Components - JMPS-M and JMPS-E procure tactical computer hardware through a non-developmental item acquisition strategy.  Tactical computer equipment is used to plan and analyze expeditionary missions and aircraft routes under various mission configurations and operational threat environments.  Primary outputs are tasking orders, courses of action (COAs), route plans, and mission essential data loads for mission execution.  New workstations consist of aircraft unique data transfer devices and interfaces, Memory Data Loader Receptacles (MDLR) Small Computer Standard Interface (SCSI) (MDLR-S), Electronic Kneeboard (EKB), Common Munitions Bit Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE), Ogden Data Device Ethernet Crypto (ODD-EC), Data Storage Unit Receptacle SCSI (DSUR-S), network hubs, printers, fleet training school workstations, JMPS Application Central Access Library (JACAL), training assets, and other peripheral devices for USN/USNR/USMC/USMCR missions.  Legacy data loader receptacle failures in addition to computer interface obsolescence and an inability to influence airframe changes for legacy aircraft in sustainment, drive a need to obtain a new data loader using a more extensive interface. JMPS Authority to Operate (ATO) requires compliance with Naval Network Warfare Command (NNWC)-issued Information Assurance (IA) mandates and Communications Tasking Orders (CTOs).

Software/Production Engineering Support - The NavMPS program produces software releases via an evolutionary development process.  These releases contain enhancements based on fleet inputs and technology challenges.  They also contain changes required to retain compatibility with supported platforms, associated weapons, and threat and imagery databases providing input to NavMPS.  Software releases are independent of hardware buys.  Cost element includes production support services, engineering support services, independent verification and validation test and acceptance, site activation, IA compliance and quality assurance efforts.

Integrated Logistics Support - Site surveys, prepare site installation drawings, on-site engineering and logistics evaluations for installations and delivery systems comply with the specified configuration.  This includes the production and delivery of technical documentation and training materials such as OPNOTES, installation instructions, user manuals required during the fielding of NavMPS products. ILS is a cost factor independent of FY hardware quantity and cost.

FY18 provides funding to procure seven hundred fifty (750) JMPS-M flight planning seats, and five (5) JMPS-E workstations, Electronic Kneeboards (EKB), training assets, and other JMPS support equipment; the continuation of enhancements of software releases based on fleet inputs, emerging technologies, IA compliance and associated logistics support.  FY18 laptop procurement supports MH-53E, CNATRA (training aircraft),C-2, E-2C, E-2D, VH-3/60, NLH, AH-1, UH-1, AV-8B, JMPS-E, CH-53E, and CH-53K.  Additionally, funding provides for database systems with storage space capable of storing National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) world-wide map data with associated network hardware. This will provide the Fleet with the required storage for map data, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and imagery necessary to plan missions. EKB provides inflight mission planning, flight administration, and situational awareness data in a tablet form.

FY18 OCO funding supports the Common Munitions Bit and Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE) for the upgrade and procurement of units and spares to support fleet operations.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) provides a self-contained, standardized, rapidly deployable, modular, scalable, and reconfigurable joint command and control (C2) capability to designated Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs).  DJC2 is the materiel solution to Defense Planning Guidance that called for the development of standing Joint Task Forces (JTF) with a deployable C2 capability.  DJC2 will ensure that Joint Force Commanders (JFC) are equipped as well as trained and organized to carry out their C2 responsibilities.  DJC2 provides GCCs and JFCs a mission critical, integrated family of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute and assess operations.  It is designed to deploy rapidly, set up within hours and quickly provide necessary C2 mission and collaboration functionality across the full spectrum of JTF operations.  The DJC2 has also been deployed in support of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts.  The capability is intended for all levels of conflict and will be reconfigurable to meet specific GCC and JTF mission requirements.  This capability is interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces.

DJC2 sites are as follows: 6 DJC2 core systems garrisoned at USSOUTHCOM Tampa, Florida (1), USEUCOM Stuttgart, Germany (1), AFRICOM (SETAF) Vicenza, Italy (1), USPACOM Camp Smith, Hawaii (1),  Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) Camp Hansen, Japan (1), and NAVEUR-NAVAF, JFC Naples, Italy (1).

Note that DJC2 is not a follow-on or replacement system for the Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J); rather, DJC2 employs a suite of applications, ensuring interoperability with the worldwide-installed base of GCCS-J.

Funding has been moved to BLI 2906 starting in FY 2017 as part of the BLI consolidation effort.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) funding Increase in FY18 procures an MTOC C4I gear set to support increased operations with Allied Forces.  Global Force Management policies have increased requirements for P-8A aircraft operations in EUCOM. This additional funding provides ability to conduct multi-site P-8A surveillance operations in USEUCOM Area of Responsibility to counter/monitor growing threats.   The P-8A surveillance program ensures unfettered access of Sea-Lines of Communication and freedom of navigation for the United States and her Allies.   Funding maximizes communications (C4I) and inter-operability with Allied forces.

Commencing in FY17, OPN line item 2246 (PE 0204271N) was consolidated with OPN line item 2906 to align Tactical Mobile (TacMobile) C4I procurements with TacMobile MPRF P-8A Aircraft Support Systems procurements. Additionally in FY17, DJC2 funding from line item 2804 was realigned to line item 2906 as part of the Budget Line Item Consolidation effort.

Tactical/Mobile (TacMobile) C4I Systems: The Tactical Mobile program provides evolutionary systems and equipment upgrades to support the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force Commanders with the capability to plan, direct and control the tactical operations of Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) and other assigned units within their respective area of responsibility. Looking ahead, TacMobile provides critical reach-back capabilities between the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft, primarily the P-8A/Poseidon, and MQ-4C/Triton, and the Maritime Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Enterprise. These operations include littoral, open ocean, and over land long-dwell surveillance, anti-surface warfare, over-the-horizon targeting, counter-drug operations, power projection, anti-submarine warfare, mining, search and rescue, indications and warnings, and special operations. The missions are supported by the fixed-site Tactical Operations Centers (TOCs) and Mobile Tactical Operations Centers (MTOCs). Each TacMobile unit is a system-of-systems. TOCs provide sensor and tactical data communications systems; mission planning/mission support, sensor analysis capabilities; avionics and weapons system interfaces, media devices and data handling capabilities, at fixed-site locations. MTOC is a scalable, mobile version of the TOC for contingency operations and for support of MPRA operations from remote forward operating base airfields.

7 TOCs: 6 operational systems (located at Jacksonville Florida, Sigonella Italy, Kaneohe Bay Hawaii, Whidbey Island Washington, Kadena Japan, and Bahrain), and 1 laboratory system (the "TacMobile Systems Integration Lab" (TMSIL), collocated at SSC Atlantic detachment Patuxent River Maryland with PMA-290's P-8A "Pax River Systems Integration Lab" (PAXSIL)).

15 MTOCs: 9 operational systems (home ported at Jacksonville Florida (4 sites), Whidbey Island Washington (4 sites), and Coronado (North Island) California (1 site)), 1 laboratory system (an aircraft integration lab located at Navy Detachment Dallas), 1 C4I engineering and maintenance support system (located at the In Service Engineering Activity (ISEA), SSC Atlantic), 1 C4I mobile systems schoolhouse (located at the Center for Naval Air Technical Training (CNATT) Jacksonville Florida), 1 system undergoing End -2- End production, and 2 legacy systems awaiting End-to-End refresh/recapitalization to meet current operational configuration/requirements (SSC Atlantic).

The TacMobile program uses an evolutionary development strategy consisting of incremental upgrades to meet new and emergent Fleet requirements, while retaining current capabilities. Increments are planned and resourced to support the MPRF Family of Systems aircraft: P-8A Poseidon aircraft and its upgrades; Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS); and MQ-4C Triton.

Tactical/Mobile C4I Systems fund TacMobile Command, Control, Computer, Communications and Intelligence (C4I), network, and reach back communications systems modernization. Additionally, the line item funds TacMobile interfaces with P-8A (including Advanced Airborne Sensor (AAS)) and MQ-4C aircraft systems and sensors, and tactical communications modernization. Together these separate capabilities are combined to provide the TOCs and MTOCs with an Integrated Warfighting Capability to support Maritime Patrol P-8A operation requirements and pace aircraft modernization requirements.

TacMobile C4I/P-8A modernization are synchronized to provide Technical Refreshes and Incremental Capability upgrades which provide the underlying C4I Infrastructure components and aircraft support capabilities components that ride on the C4I infrastructure. There are five major TacMobile components comprised of currently twenty three distinct subsystems that are developed in synchronization to work together, and are therefore fielded together. New or modernized aircraft interfaces are built specifically to integrate onto the new or modernized C4I infrastructure. They operate together as an overarching system of systems.

Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) provides a self-contained, standardized, rapidly deployable, modular, scalable, and reconfigurable joint command and control (C2) capability to designated Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs). DJC2 is the materiel solution to Defense Planning Guidance that called for the development of standing Joint Task Forces (JTF) with a deployable C2 capability. DJC2 will ensure that Joint Force Commanders (JFC) are equipped as well as trained and organized to carry out their C2 responsibilities. DJC2 provides GCCs and JFCs a mission critical, integrated family of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute and assess operations. It is designed to deploy rapidly, set up within hours and quickly provide necessary C2 mission and collaboration functionality across the full spectrum of JTF operations. The DJC2 has also been deployed in support of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) efforts. The capability is intended for all levels of conflict and will be reconfigurable to meet specific GCC and JTF mission requirements. This capability is interoperable with higher and adjacent echelons of command (to include coalition allies) as well as with supporting elements to include joint forces. 

DJC2 sites are as follows: 6 DJC2 core systems garrisoned at USSOUTHCOM Tampa, Florida (1), USEUCOM Stuttgart, Germany (1), AFRICOM (SETAF) Vicenza, Italy (1), USPACOM Camp Smith, Hawaii (1), Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) Camp Hansen, Japan (1), and NAVEUR-NAVAF, JFC Naples, Italy (1).

Note that DJC2 is not a follow-on or replacement system for the Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J); rather, DJC2 employs a suite of applications, ensuring interoperability with the worldwide-installed base of GCCS-J.

FY18 funding procures DJC2 system enhancements for six sites, focusing on delivering Next Generation Enclave (NGE). FY18 funds also includes delivering NGE enhancements with the addition of Command and Control in a Communications Denied Environment (C2CDE) equipment. These enhancements reduce DJC2 size, weight, and power requirements and also enhances DJC2 cyber security posture.">4.1) DJC2 Increment I System Enhancements</proc:Name>

Quantities represent separate Command &amp; Control &amp; Intelligence (C2I), Communications, Aircraft Interface, and Mobility/Facility component system upgrades of TacMobile systems.    2. TacMobile Tech Refresh consists of refreshing 5 major components (made up of 23 individual subsystems) that range in cost from $850K to $2,500K. The Tech Refresh hardware composition is dependent upon the requirements of the site at the time of refresh.  As an example, in FY16, the unit cost was $1,979K, with the only component scheduled for procurement being the C4I component (at $1,979K).  The average unit cost ranges from $1,319K in FY17 to $1,855K in FY18, due to varying costs of components being procured: Tactical Data Links (TADILs) ($850K) and Facilities ($1,788K) in FY17;  Aircraft Interfaces ($1,087K), C4I ($1,979K), and Communications ($2,500K) in FY18.  3. FY17 installs include 1 unit procured in FY16 in BLI 2906 and 2 units procured in FY16 BLI 2246 due to line item consolidation.">MTOC -- Procurement</proc:Name>

The tech refresh hardware composition is dependent upon the requirements of the site at the time of refresh.  As an example, in FY16, the average unit cost was $707K, with the primary component procured being the C4I component (at $770K).  The average unit cost ranges from $919K in FY17 to $1,027K in FY18, in part due to more expensive primary components, to include Person portable Common Data Link (PCDL) ($1,100K) and Higher Than SECRET (HTS) Enclaves ($980K).  3.

            <proc:Description>The Distributed Common Ground System - Navy (DCGS-N) is the Navy's portion of the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence (USD (I)) DCGS Family of Systems (FoS). The Department of Defense (DoD) has defined a DCGS architecture that will be compatible and interoperable across all of the Services' Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and operations. DCGS accesses and ingests data from space borne, airborne, subsurface, and surface ISR collection assets, intelligence databases and intelligence producers. This collected data is shared across a Joint enterprise using the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) and in time, the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) to enhance access and sharing of ISR information across Joint forces through the use of common enterprise standards and services. DCGS FoS supports Joint Task Force (JTF)-level and below combat operations with critical intelligence for battle management and information dominance across the full spectrum of operations, including peace, conflict, war, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). DCGS is a cooperative effort between the services, agencies, and DoD to provide systems capable of receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data from airborne and national reconnaissance platforms. DCGS-N core components include the Analyst Work Station from the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) - Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3), Generic Area Limitation Environment (GALE) Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Common Geo-positioning Services (CGS), Image Product Library (IPL), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), Joint Concentrator Architecture (JCA) and Track Management Services.

The DCGS-N system represents the integration of 1) The processing and exploitation of tactical and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) and SIGINT; 2) Precision target geopositioning, mensuration, and imagery dissemination capabilities; 3) Selected national IMINT requirements and processing capabilities from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); and 4) Sharing of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) and Command and Control information via DIB, DI2E, and Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) standards with a wide range of customers (e.g., Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M)), Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), and many others.

The DCGS-N Enterprise Node (DEN), which incorporates current DIB standards and DI2E policy, facilitates interoperability and data sharing among the DCGS FoS. DCGS-N ensures compliance with the DoD DCGS network architecture.

The Navy is establishing an ISR Enterprise way ahead that will emphasize a reach back strategy to provide intelligence products to support deployed ship and shore operations. The Navy will also migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires the development, integration, and testing of a Maritime ISR Enterprise capability, development and migration of ISR SOA applications, and development and integration to leverage a Common Computing Environment (CCE) and the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE). Additionally, DCGS-N will become the focal point for migration of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) fusion and analysis Maritime Fusion &amp; Analysis (MFAS) tool applications for the Navy.

DCGS-N Increment 2 addresses a critical shortfall in Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) capability and capacity to support operational, tactical planning, and execution across the full range of joint military operations. Existing TCPED shortfalls will be exacerbated by planned Navy, Joint, and Allied fielding of new ISR platforms. Currently fielded systems provide localized processing capabilities that will be overwhelmed in future years without a significant change in the way the Navy processes, exploits and disseminates intelligence data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will deliver all source fusion and analytical capabilities; provide MDA capabilities and integrate TCPED capabilities to improve the use and analysis of sensor and platform data. DCGS-N Increment 2 will be based on an enterprise solution to share this information across commands, services, and agencies to promote shared situational awareness. DCGS-N Increment 2 consists of multiple releases. The first release provides an enhanced Navy ISR enterprise that converges and builds on the DCGS-N Increment 1 and Maritime Domain Awareness Enterprise Nodes; leverages the DI2E; is compliant with the CCE and the IC ITE; federates ISR and TCPED workflow and production improving throughout the automation; exploits new and evolving unmanned systems sensor data; provides Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) cross-queuing and modular tools. The second release enhances afloat ISR capabilities by providing a set of software centric tools providing Multi-INT fusion and analysis, behavior prediction and intelligent knowledge management designed to operate in disconnected or denied communications environment. Follow-on releases will be developed based on Fleet requirements.

Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) is a suite of multi-source intelligence and analytical capabilities which includes an integrated Three-Dimensional (3-D) operational picture displaying intelligence and other data sources to provide a richer and more complete picture of the battle space on Unit Level platforms. The system supports a full motion video capability that receives, processes, exploits, and disseminates organic and non-organic data as well as the ability to process and correlate Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and external Communications Intelligence (COMINT Externals). It integrates mature Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) applications with shared storage and communication paths to reach back to the DEN, and it provides data sharing to the Maritime Operations Centers (MOC) and national ISR systems, making tactical users a part of the larger ISR enterprise.
  
ICOP is subset to DCGS-N capabilities for Unit Level platforms. DCGS-N only fields on Force Level platforms. There are currently Unit Level platforms identified to receive permanent ICOP Partial or Full Foundation Kit installations. ICOP Foundation Kits include all cabling and mounting plate foundations for antennas and ICOP workstations. The Unit Level platforms will pull from a ICOP workstation or ICOP workstation and Communications Module 3s (CM3s) System rotatable pool based on deployment. ICOP fielding strategy requires both partial foundation kit and ICOP workstations without CM3s or ICOP workstations, (2) CM3s and full foundation kits based on fleet prioritization. Unit level platforms include cruisers (CG), destroyers (DDG), and amphibious transport docks (LPD-17) platforms. Crypto Modifications (Mods) were added to the CM3 production unit end item in FY16 to meet the new mandate for Type 1 Encryption transmission of sensor data.

            <proc:Justification>DCGS-N Increment 1 planned procurements in FY18 include (9) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (2) 2-rack Ashore technical refreshes, (4) 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes, (2) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades, and (1) End-of-Life Ashore Hardware Upgrades. These DCGS-N installations will replace the currently fielded legacy systems and leverage the Navy's CCE as applicable as well as provide upgrades to extend service life.

OCO: 
Due to Operation Enduring Freedom In Theater (OEF T) requirements in Central Command (CENTCOM), including the requirements for all deploying maritime assets to support overall theater Strategic Communications objectives, there is a theater demand for unit level intelligence Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capability, specifically for full motion video (FMV). Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F) requires ICOP capabilities to respond to CENCOM and NAVY-wide OPTASK Visual Information (VI) and multi-intelligence requirements to address current and emerging threats. ICOP will replace legacy IDIS laptops and improve current capabilities to warfighters at the unit level, including direct downlink of intelligence information from a wide-range of theater airborne sensors (e.g. P-3, Predator, Reaper, Scan Eagle, F/A-18, etc.) resulting in 90% improvement in battlespace awareness for the deployed unit. Due to its enhanced capability to process and stream intelligence data from airborne platforms and shipboard video sensors, ICOP has transformed unit level ships into intelligence producers, leading to C5F requesting that ICOP be fielded on all unit level platforms deploying into theater.  
Specifically, C5F requires 25 ICOP systems (system = 1 ICOP box + 2 CM3s) and associated ICOP foundation kits. The materiel solution at the time consisted of a non-standardized IDIS laptop, which could not meet operational OPTASK VI requirements to disseminate off board FMV/ISR data due to shipboard bandwidth constraints. The initial response to these requirements messages resulted in OPNAV resourcing four ICOP prototypes, a system that was designed to rapidly facilitate data dissemination efforts within current shipboard bandwidth allocations. Only four systems were funded at the time due to risk reduction activities associated with a lack of a completed formal Operational Test event. Since the original requirements messages were released, resourcing the full C5F requirement has become even more critical, as C5F has seen a proliferation of new sensors coming on-line in their AOR, and the expansion of data that is required to get back to fleet commanders has dramatically increased. This not only requires an increased number of ICOP workstations from four to 25, but it also mandates transitioning out the legacy antenna/receivers, which does not ingest Type 1 transmissions inherent with the new manned and unmanned sensor data. Due to the additional sensors and sensor data types, continued requirements are further being levied on every platform to meet OPTASK VI requirements, such as the Fleet Visual Information CONOPs, and the Promulgation of the Visual Information Concept of Operations. C5F requires the requisite materiel solutions (ICOP and CM3s) to meet this growing demand. Also, ICOP has been deemed operationally effective and suitable, and was recommended for fleet release by COMOPTEVFOR. 

Due to European Reassurance Initiative (ERI); this request supports the planned C6F Forward-Deployed Naval Forces (FDNF) DDG FY20 rotation with full Intelligence Carry-On Program (ICOP) ISR capability.  In order to support this rotation cycle, it is necessary to receive funding in FY18 to meet Navy Modernization Process timelines.   FY18 activities include shipboard installation drawings (SIDs), and installation contracting. Currently, the following DDGs are planned for rotation:  USS Arleigh Burke (DDG 51), USS Roosevelt (DDG 80), USS Bulkeley (DDG 84) and USS Oscar Austin (DDG 79).  The USS Oscar Austin is already planned, within the current ICOP budget profile, to receive full ICOP capability.  However, the three remaining platforms would require an upgrade, which is not included in the current budget outlay. It is critical to outfit all C6F FDNF ships with full ICOP ISR processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) capability to address NATO Reassurance Measures and theater maritime and ballistic missile threats.  As demonstrated during the C6F/Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) hosted "At-Sea-Demonstration 2015," the ICOP capability significantly enhanced C6F's ability to rapidly provide situational awareness and common tactical pictures with the C6F Maritime Operations Center, maritime units supporting NATO's Readiness Action Plan and the European Phased Adaptive Approach.

The FY18 OCO request adds an additional (3) platforms (11 total) towards meeting the original 25 workstation requirement to enable C5F to meet operational requirements in theater. In addition, The FY18 OCO request includes (3) platforms (3 total) towards meeting the original 4 workstation requirement to enable C6F to meet operational requirements.

This accounts for the difference in prior year funding.  FY18 increase in Afloat product improvement procurement unit cost is a result of FY17 procuring (4) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (1) 1-rack Afloat technical refresh and (3) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades whereas FY18 consist of (6) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (4) 1-rack Afloat technical refresh and (2) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades. The procurement of fewer End-of-Life Afloat Hardware upgrades and more 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes in FY18 drive the cost closer to the more expensive 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes. Procurement costs range from $450K for a End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrade to $1,080K for a 1-rack Afloat technical refresh. FY18 increase in Afloat product improvement installation unit cost is a result of FY17 installing (3) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (0) 1-rack Afloat technical refresh and (3) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades whereas FY18 consist of (5) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (4) 1-rack Afloat technical refresh and (1) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades. The installation of fewer End-of-Life Afloat Hardware upgrades and more 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes in FY18 drive the cost closer to the more expensive 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes. Installation costs range from $300K for a End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrade to $950K for a 1-rack Afloat technical refresh. DCGS-N Inc 1 Block 1 and 2 unit costs represent an average cost based on 3 Rack, 2 Rack, 1 Rack, and End-of-Life Hardware Upgrade configurations dependent on specific platform (CVN, LHD, LCC, LHA), network, infrastructure versions, and alignment with the Navy's Network Infrastructure CCE. In addition, unit costs continue to be updated based on actuals costs, locality and availability of platforms, and specific integration tasking associated with external dependent systems (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), Radiant Mercury (RM), and others).  DCGS-N Increment 1 planned procurements in FY18 include (9) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (2) 2-rack Ashore technical refreshes, (4) 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes, (2) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades, and (1) End-of-Life Ashore Hardware Upgrades. These DCGS-N installations will replace the currently fielded legacy systems and leverage the Navy's Common Computing Environment (CCE)to extend service life. 1st QTR installations reflected in the Installation Schedule are funded in the PY in order to be able to fund the installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work. 90 days are needed to allow sufficient time for the contractor to plan the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication.">DCGS-N Tech Refresh/Upgrade -- Procurement</proc:Name>

This accounts for the difference in prior year funding. DCGS-N Inc 1 Block 1 and Block 2 unit costs represent an average cost based on 5 Rack, 3 Rack, 2 Rack, 1 Rack, and End-of-Life Upgrade configurations dependent on specific platform (CVN, LHD, LCC, LHA), network, infrastructure versions, and alignment with the Navy's Network Infrastructure (Common Computing Environment (CCE)). In addition, unit costs continue to be updated based on actuals costs, locality and availability of platforms, and specific integration tasking associated with external dependent systems (e.g. Global Command and Control System - Maritime (GCCS-M), Radiant Mercury (RM), and others).  DCGS-N Increment 1 planned procurements in FY18 include (9) DCGS-N Increment 1 technical refreshes that consist of (2) 2-rack Ashore technical refreshes, (4) 1-rack Afloat technical refreshes, (2) End-of-Life Afloat Hardware Upgrades, and (1) End-of-Life Ashore Hardware Upgrades. These DCGS-N installations will replace the currently fielded legacy systems and leverage the Navy's Common Computing Environment (CCE) as applicable as well as provide upgrades to extend service life.">DCGS-N Tech Refresh/Upgrade -- Procurement</proc:Name>

Procurement cost range from $15K for a Partial and $55K for a Full Foundation Kit.  After PB17, the ICOP fielding strategy was updated to include a mixture of partial and full ICOP workstation and Foundation Kit configurations. Unit Cost and Quantities have been updated to reflect the new fielding strategy. Fleet prioritization determines which unit level platform receives a partial or full ICOP workstations and Foundation Kit configuration.  ICOP Foundation Kit procurements include all cabling and mounting plate foundations for an ICOP workstation and antennas/receivers. Quantities consist of two configurations depending on the platform receiving the capability.  The first configuration is a full foundation kit with cabling and mounting plate foundations for both the ICOP workstation and antennas/receivers.  The second configuration is a partial foundation kit with mounting plate foundations for an ICOP workstation only. Foundation Kit unit price varies depending on platform and Full or Partial Foundation Kit, which is determined based on fleet prioritization.   ICOP Partial and Full Foundation Kits will be permanently installed on Unit Level platforms. The Unit Level platforms with permanent Foundation Kits will pull from the ICOP workstation and CM3 rotatable pool when deploying.">1.1.1) ICOP Foundation Kit Procurement</proc:Name>

Procurement costs range from $50K for a partial to $450K for a Full (without Crypto Mods (Prior Years)). Crypto Mods were added to CM3s starting in FY16 and therefore increased Full procurement unit cost to $490K in FY16 and out.  ICOP System procurements include an ICOP workstation or an ICOP workstation and (2) CM3 Antennas. (2) CM3 Antennas provides the platform with approximately 360 degree coverage to receive non-organic sensor data. ICOP Systems will not be permanently installed on a Platform. After procurement, ICOP workstations and ICOP workstations with CM3s Systems will become a part of a rotatable pool for deploying Unit Level Platforms.  ICOP quantities consist of two configurations depending on the platform receiving the capability.  The first configuration (Full) is a ICOP unit made up of an ICOP workstation and (2) CM3 antennas.  The second configuration (partial) is an ICOP unit without any CM3s. ICOP system unit price varies depending on whether the platform will receive an ICOP workstation and CM3s (antennas/receivers) or just an ICOP workstation, which is determined based on fleet prioritization.">1.1.2) ICOP System Procurement</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) is the Navy's only Program of Record to replace existing afloat networks and provide the necessary infrastructure for applications, systems, and services to dominate the cyber warfare domain. CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing, separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS), Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks, and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.

The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside.  CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware, software, processing, storage, and end user devices for Unclassified, Coalition, Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email, web, chat, collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants, submarines, Maritime Operations Centers (MOC), Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSC) and Aircraft. In addition, hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Information Operations, Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through application integration, the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and Navy-validated applications, systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs, such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy, Global Command and Control System - Maritime, Naval Tactical Command Support System, and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System, are dependent on the CANES common computing environment to field, host, and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.

CANES will develop technical updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline to ensure no cyber security vulnerabilities exist due to hardware and software obsolescence.  Fielding of CANES hardware and software baselines will be in alignment with the Chief of Naval Operation's Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP).  Technology refresh of existing CANES systems will be inclusive of both the latest CANES hardware and software baselines and will be executed on each ship no later than every six years.  CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition, contracting, and test events, and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines, logistics, and training efforts into a unified support structure.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY18 increase in the CANES funding profile optimizes a larger percentage of Chief of Naval Operations ship availabilities to mitigate heightened cyber security threats across Navy tactical networks and supports the Deputy Secretary of Defense direction to remove End of Life (EOL) Windows Operating Systems software from the Fleet as quickly as feasible.  Microsoft's end of cyber security support for legacy versions of Windows, as well as networks that rely on obsolete hardware and software, are driving increased sustainment costs, reducing operational availability and creating critical cyber security vulnerability in Navy Tactical Networks. Replacing these legacy networks and modernizing the tactical environment with CANES is the cornerstone for all C4ISR investments. The program has demonstrated a robust production and installation industrial base capable of executing the planned work in FY18.  

FY 2018 - CANES funds are for the procurement of (24) Afloat production units (2 Force Level, 11 Unit Level, 11 Subs), (13) Technical Insertion units (1 Force Level, 9 Unit Level, 3 Subs), and (1) Afloat First Article, with integration and associated costs for pre-installation design and the installation of (13) Afloat production units and (11) Technical Insertion units. CANES funds will also be used for the procurement and installation of (1) Ashore production unit.

It is important to note that procurement quantities across the FYDP are the same CANES end item product referenced in CANES Intell LI 2925. Installation quantities represent sites receiving CANES as also referenced in LI 2925. The associated dollars in this exhibit represent the non-MIP portions of the CANES enclave.

The decrease in average unit installation cost from FY17 to FY18 is due to a reduced number of more expensive Force Level (CVN, LHD) units in the FY18 installation plan. FY17 quantities were adjusted from PB17 due to fact of life fielding plan changes driven by installation availability schedules, resulting in a different mix of platforms procured and installed.

First Articles are defined as necessary production design drawings, environmental (shock and vibration) qualifications, logistics and training artifacts as well as a certified tested baseline provided to the government for each platform first of its kind. All following articles of the same variant require a Production Lead Time of 5 months for Ashore units and 6 months for afloat units. Total Ashore lead time, including 1 month Admin lead time, is 6 months. Ashore production lead times require one month less than Afloat production lead times due to the long lead time afloat production quality racks and minimized shock and vibration requirements for shore facilities. CANES First Articles are not installed. First Article average unit cost fluctuations are attributable to variances in system configuration requirements among shore sites. A shore training unit (TTE) has fewer users and runs fewer applications than a shore Maritime Operations Center (MOC). MOCs are larger in scale compared to the shore training sites and represent a super set of users, applications and connected systems.

This procedure allows installations to be scheduled in the first quarter, supporting Fleet availabilities.  - CANES installations are conducted across several fleet concentration areas supported by six installation Multiple Award Contract (MAC) holders. The SPAWAR Installation Management Organization (IMO) has ensured sufficient Alteration Installation Teams (AIT) resources are available to meet the FY18 - 22 CANES installation plan.  - CANES Afloat production units require an additional 4 months after delivery for integration, assembly and testing prior to installation start.  Installations do not begin until 10 months after contract award (6 months production lead time (PLT) + 4 months integration). Total lead time, including admin lead time, is 11 months.  - The procurement average unit cost fluctuation is due to variance in system configuration requirements for each CANES platform type.  Furthermore, because CANES production units and installations are procured through separate multiple award contracts, there are unit cost fluctuations associated with the contracting process.  A CANES unit level platform (DDG/CG/LSD) requires a smaller system, supporting fewer users and applications than force level platforms with a greater number of users and applications. For example, a CANES DDG design consists of 18 equipment racks and ~400 workstations, while a CANES CVN system consists of 48 equipment racks and ~3000 workstations. The average procurement cost (hardware, software, integration, and engineering support) for a unit level ship ranges from $5.2M to $7.5M, while the average procurement cost for a force level platform ranges from $11.8M to $15.6M, and submarine unit procurement costs range from $2.7M to $4.6M. These costs include both the MIP and non-MIP components of the CANES units.  - Installation cost fluctuations are attributed to and dependent on ship class, variant of predecessor system the hull currently has installed .As an example of variant differences, if a CVN has an ISNS Delta variant installed, a CANES installation is estimated to be $18.2M. If that same CVN had a legacy Asynchronous Transfer Mode Local Area Network (ATM LAN) the CANES installation is estimated to be $22.4M.   FY17 quantities were adjusted from PB17 due to fact of life fielding plan changes driven by installation availability schedules, resulting in a different mix of platforms procured and installed.">1.1.1) CANES - Afloat 5F010/5F777 (Non-MIP) - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

First articles are separate from production units and must be bought prior to the procurement of the corresponding production units. Procurement Lead Time (PLT) is 8 months for First Articles (DDG,CVN, submarines, etc). All following production articles of the same variant require a PLT of 6 months. CANES First Articles are not installed. Average unit cost fluctuations are attributable to variances in system configuration requirements among platforms. A DDG/CG/LSD (unit level platforms) has fewer users and runs fewer applications than a LHD/CVN/LPD (force level platforms). Force level platforms are larger in scale compared to the unit level ships and represent a super set of users, applications and connected systems.">1.2.1) CANES - Afloat First Articles (Non-MIP) - Organic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>The Radiation Detection, Indication and Computation (RADIAC) Program is responsible for providing radiation monitoring instruments that detect and measure ionizing radiation.  These instruments are used on all Navy, Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels, and at every Navy shore installation, in order to ensure the safety of personnel, continuity of operations in radiological or nuclear contingencies, and protection of the environment.

[P40A / M2100 - Survey Meters]: M2100.  Radiation survey meters, required by 10CFR20 and the Navy's mission, are used to detect, measure and monitor radiation levels in support of operations involving radioactive materials.  Navy operations associated with radioactive materials include operation of nuclear reactors, maintenance on radioactive systems or components, testing of components for structural integrity (X-ray), research, and medical diagnostics and treatment.  Additionally, radiation survey meters are used to search for, locate and intercept radioactive material, and in responding to casualties involving radioactive materials.  Where radiation survey meters are used to support operations involving radioactive material, they provide real-time information used to control personnel radiation exposure and to identify and control the spread of radioactivity.  When used to search for radioactive material, they provide an extremely reliable method of identifying radioactive material while minimizing the risk to personnel conducting these operations.

[P40A / Radiological Detection System]: M2100, Radiological Detection System (RDS):  This is a basic RADIAC instrument used in Consequence Management and Occupational Safety and Health applications by all ships (U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command) and shore commands.  It is used to survey for radioactive surface contamination pursuant to nuclear plant operations or nuclear plant maintenance; following medical procedures involving radioactive isotopes; or casualties and events that release radioactivity into the environment such as after a nuclear reactor accident or the use of weapons involving nuclear devices or radioactivity.  It is also used to perform surveys for various types of radiation in order to monitor environmental conditions in areas and spaces immediately adjacent to where radioactive material is stored or used during routine operations; where nuclear plant operations occur; and where radioisotopes are used for maintenance, such as during industrial radiography operations.

The RDS consists of a control unit and a suite of probes that survey for different types of radioactivity (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Neutron).  The control unit is necessary for all applications but the four probes are used for different situations.  That means the control unit will have the highest procurement objective and the four probes will be bought in varying quantities.  The probes will be configured as a separate unit of issue and provided to customers dependent upon the intended end use.

This instrument will replace the Navy's 30-year old IM-265/PDQ Multi-Function RADIAC control unit and its ancillary probes, of which there are several thousand control units and probes in the inventory.  The procurement will be phased over multiple years.  The RDS is being developed by the Joint Project Manager, Radiological &amp; Nuclear Defense in order that the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force will have a Joint instrument that will enable interoperability and surge support of assets from all the components to forward deployed units.

[P40A / M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2100 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.

[P40A / M2200 - Dosimetry]: M2200.  Dosimetry consists of radiation sensitive materials that are used for detecting and measuring an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation and to aid in minimizing this exposure.  Dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity or by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity.  Most dosimeters are small devices that are worn on the belt, on a lanyard around the neck or attached to a shirt.  Some dosimeters provide direct readout enabling the wearer to monitor and control radiation exposure.  Other types of dosimeters must be removed from the wearer to be evaluated in special dosimeter readers that extract the recorded radiation exposure value from the dosimeter.  Radiation exposure measured by dosimetry is recorded in individual medical records when formal tracking of the radiation exposure is required. 

In accordance with 10CFR20, dosimetry is required to be worn by personnel who work with sources of radioactivity.  In the Navy this includes personnel in the Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, and Medical and Radiological Affairs Support programs.  In these programs radiation exposure is measured by dosimetry and recorded in individual medical records for tracking purposes.  Dosimetry is also worn by personnel responding to casualties involving radioactivity to control their exposure within acceptable levels.

[P40A / DT-702 Card]: M2200, DT-702 Card:  The DT-702 Thermoluminescent Dosimeter (TLD) is a small metal card, a little smaller and thinner than a domino, that contains four circular slots containing different elements that are sensitive to various types of radioactivity.  The card is placed in a plastic holder so it is protected and able to be worn by personnel on a lanyard or on their clothing.  It is issued to sailors and civilians who are occupationally exposed to radiation.  This includes Navy programs such as Nuclear Propulsion, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Nuclear Weapons, Industrial Radiography and Medical.  The DT-702 provides primary dosimetry, whereby dosage accumulated on this card can be entered into the respective person's permanent medical files.  The processes associated with the DT-702 also are compliant with 10CFR20 by being approved by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which is administered by the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST).  The cards are issued to individuals and tracked by serial numbers.  The cards are periodically turned in (and another card is issued so there is no coverage gap) to have the dose extracted by an 8800 Reader.  The process by which the cards are read include several heating cycles that eventually make the receptor elements unusable, so the life of a TLD is finite -- about 100 reads -- and then they have to be replaced.  Cards are procured approximately every two to three years in order to achieve the lowest unit price available when buying in quantity.  Under the current contract the most cost effective price is achieved at no fewer than 20,000 units.

[P40A / DT-702 Card Holder]: M2200, DT-702 Card Holder:  A plastic case into which the DT-702 card is placed for the card's protection and so it can be worn on a lanyard or on a belt.  It has four circular windows made of specific materials of various thickness to allow the proper filtration of radiation to the dosimeter elements under each of the windows.

[P40A / Extremity Dosimeter]: M2200, Extremity Dosimeter:  An extremity dosimeter is used to measure concentrated exposure to the hands when a radiation worker is reaching into a glove box or medical personnel are performing fluoroscopy tasks.  This item is composed of three inexpensive pieces:  1) a plastic ring ($2) to wear on a finger; 2) a dosimeter ($36) that measures exposure; and 3) a cap that secures the dosimeter to the ring.  The ring is made to a specific thickness depending on the type of radiation the dosimeter is intended to measure ($3).  These items will be procured in quantities of 3,000 each.  An average unit cost for the three items is used and all 9,000 components are shown on this one Cost Element.

[P40A / Battlefield Dosimeter]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter:  A dosimeter designed for use during nuclear or radiological events involving high energy gamma and neutron irradiation.  The concept of operations for such a dosimeter is that it is issued at MOP (Military Operational Posture) III to allow the commander to manage the exposure received by members of recovery teams.  It is also used to perform triage on casualties, allowing medical personnel to effectively allocate their ministrations.

[P40A / Battlefield Dosimeter Cases]: M2200, Battlefield Dosimeter Cases:  The Battlefield Dosimeter will spend much of its time aboard ships stored in Damage Control Lockers.  The instrument will also have to be shipped to and from a RADIAC Calibration Laboratory to undergo periodic calibrations.  Because allowances for the instruments on the various ship classes range from 12 on an LCS to 700 each on a CVN, cases configured to hold different quantities (25, 50, 100) will be procured to afford the necessary protection for storage and shipping while maximizing shipboard storage space efficiency.  The price shown in FYs 2015 and 2016 were for cases that hold 100 units.  Thereafter, cases in all three sizes will be procured and costs will vary.  All configurations will be shown on one Cost Element.

[P40A / Electronic Personal Dosimeter]: M2200, Electronic Personal Dosimeter (EPD):  An electronic dosimeter that includes a real-time digital display of radiation dose being received.  These so-called secondary dosimeters are normally used in conjunction with the DT-702 primary dosimeter in order to provide the wearer with real-time radiation dose information and alarm features that aid workers in controlling their radiation exposure.  The DT-702 (Cost Element 2.1) is the Navy's approved dosimeter to record dose of record in each individual's medical record, but it is a "passive" device; i.e., it does not immediately display the dose being received.  Instead, the dose is stored on the card on four different elements. It must be turned in and read by a machine (the 8800 Reader), a process that takes weeks, and therefore does not indicate if the wearer is in imminent danger.

[P40A / M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2200 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.

[P40A / M2400 - Other RADIAC]: M2400.  Other RADIAC.  The RADIAC Program fields 70 different families of instruments, consisting of a total of almost 43,000 instruments and 400,000 dosimeters.  Those families that fall into similar functionality have been grouped here into the M2100, M2200, M2500 and M2600 Cost Codes.  This Cost Code consists of instruments that have specialized functions that only they perform, and therefore would require an unmanageable and meaningless number of additional Cost Codes if each were addressed individually.  In the context of the family metaphor used here, these instruments are no less important but are orphans in the sense there are not many of similar functionality that they could be grouped with.
This Cost Code also supports replenishment of Ready for Issue (RFI) stocks when instruments in any Cost Code fall below stock levels sufficient to meet quarterly demand.  This Cost Element (Spares) is a Continuing element that varies year-to-year based on emergent requirements and the quantity and unit cost of the item(s) being replenished.

Supports instruments that are disparate in functionality and cannot be readily grouped into the other RADIAC Cost Codes.

[P40A / Criticality Monitor]: M2400, Criticality Monitor:  Radiation detection system used to continuously monitor general area radiation levels and designed to detect an uncontrolled reactor criticality event.  This system is used in reactor construction and overhaul facilities to ensure compliance with 10CFR20.

[P40A / Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard]: M2400, Criticality Monitor Technical Repair Standard:  Technical Repair Standard data, calibration software and initial spare parts for the Criticality Monitor.

[P40A / Tool Contamination Monitor, Shore]: M2400, Tool Contamination Monitor:  Used to scan tools and other equipment prior to release from a radiological work area to a general work area in order to ensure the equipment did not become contaminated with radiation while being used in the radiological area.

[P40A / Tool Contamination Monitor, Ship]: M2400, Tool Contamination Monitor Ship:  Certification that the units procured for shipboard use will meet DoD Standard 1399 for pitch and roll.

[P40A / Spares]: M2400, Spares:  Purchase of additional quantities of existing models of RADIACs to replenish or supplement stocks of spare items due to minor increases in program allowances, minor inventory losses, or due to items being beyond economical repair.

[P40A / M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2400 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.

[P40A / M2500 - Air Sampling Systems]: M2500.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is done to detect leaks from nuclear reactors or associated systems to ensure that radioactivity is not inadvertently released to the environment from these operations.  Additionally, monitoring for airborne radioactivity is performed during maintenance on radioactive components or during events that might cause radioactivity to be released to the air.  Monitoring for airborne radioactivity is normally done by drawing air across filter paper to collect airborne radioactive particles.  This filter paper is then evaluated by radiation detectors and the concentration of airborne radioactivity is calculated.  The types of airborne radioactivity monitoring systems include fixed systems and portable systems.
Fixed systems sample air from pre-determined locations and normally include built-in radiation detectors for determining the airborne radioactivity concentration.  Portable systems can be used to sample air at any desired location, but normally require the use of separate radiation detection instruments to measure the radioactive particles deposited on the filter paper to determine the airborne radioactivity concentration.

[P40A / Air Particle Detector (APD) Ship Frames]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship, Frames:  Government Furnished Material (GFM) to be provided to the manufacturer of the APD Ship (IM-272/WDQ).  This material consists of the housing and specific internal components from the IM-239/WDQ.  The housings and identified internal components from the IM-239/WDQ will be prepared in the depot level maintenance facility for the item and provided to the manufacturer of the IM-272/WDQ. Use of these housings and components reduces the overall cost of the IM-272/WDQ and avoids the cost of a ship alteration by ensuring the IM-272/WDQ will have the same shipboard footprint as the IM-239/WDQ.

[P40A / APD Ship]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship:  Airborne radioactivity monitoring system for use on CVNs and all submarines.   This system (IM-272/WDQ) is a replacement for the existing IM-239/WDQ used on all Navy nuclear ships.   The IM-272/WDQ incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance.

[P40A / APD Ship Engineering Change Proposal]: M2500, APD Ship Engineering Change Proposal (ECP):  Naval Reactors has directed an ECP be designed and incorporated that will reduce noise and vibration for the IM-272/WDQ in order that it will meet (classified) specifications for COLUMBIA class submarines.  No further production units will be ordered until the ECP is incorporated into the design.

[P40A / APD Ship Data]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship Data:  Upon award of the contract in September 2014, the cost of Contract Data Requirements List and Contract Line Item Number data became known.  This data includes a one-time cost for Technical Manuals in FY15.  Subsequent years include the Technical Repair Standard, drawings, and production reports with every delivery order.

[P40A / APD Ship Initial Spare Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Ship, Initial Spare Parts:  In FY17 procure initial spare parts to support fielding.  In FY18-FY20, procure parts to upgrade the initial 40 units procured in FY14 to a new acoustic standard directed by Naval Reactors.

[P40A / APD Ship Provisioning]: M2500, APD Ship Provisioning Conference:  The contractor hosted a Provisioning Conference.  At the Provisioning Conference, the equipment was broken down to Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SM&amp;R) codes and maintenance philosophies were established for each part.  Prior to the conference, preliminary copies of the following items were provided:

1. Provisioning Parts List
2. APD-Ship Interim Spare Parts List
3. Product Drawings and Associated Lists
4. Electronic Equipment Interactive Electronic Technical Manual
5. HM&amp;E Equipment Technical Repair Standard (TRS) for IM-272/WDQ RADIACMETER
6. Detail Specification Documents (DSD) 
7. Logistics Data Product, Special Equipment Long Lead Time Items List (SELLTIL)
8. Special Equipment Tools and Test Equipment List (SETTEL)
9. Logistics Data Product, Special Equipment Common and Bulk Items List (SECBIL) 
10. Engineering Data for Provisioning (EDFP)

[P40A / APD Shore]: M2500, Air Particle Detector (APD) Shore:  This system is a replacement for the existing IM-239/WDQ designed for ships that is also currently used in radiological maintenance facilities ashore.   The APD Shore incorporates significant technology enhancements that will reduce spurious false alarms and reduce operator maintenance, and since it does not need to be hardened for shipboard use, it will be cheaper to procure and maintain than the new IM-272/WDQ units (Cost Element 4.2) being procured for ships.

[P40A / APD Shore Initial Spare Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Detector, Shore, Initial Spare Parts:  Initial spare parts and Tc-99 check sources.

[P40A / Air Particle Sampler]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler:  Portable airborne radioactivity sampling system.  Used during radiological work or during radiological casualties to draw air across a filter paper to collect radioactive particles.  The filter paper is then evaluated using separately provided radiation detectors to determine the concentration of airborne radioactivity.

[P40A / Air Particle Sampler Data &amp; Parts]: M2500, Air Particle Sampler Data &amp; Parts:  Technical Repair Standard, drawings, initial spare parts and First Article Test Report for the Air Particle Sampler.

[P40A / Tritium Monitor]: M2500, Tritium Monitor:  The AN/PDR-73 Tritium Monitor is used at nuclear weapons storage facilities and research laboratories to sample the air for the presence of tritium, which is a toxic radiation hazard if inhaled. The current instrument is 30 years old and cannot be repaired due to obsolete components. At the current loss rate due to normal wear and tear there will be insufficient assets to meet operational requirements, so a replacement must be procured.

[P40A / Tritium Monitor Testing, Data, Parts &amp; Training]: M2500, Tritium Monitor Initial Spare Parts Testing, Data &amp; Training:  In FY17 procure Electro Magnetic Interference testing, Technical Manuals, and Technical Repair Standard.  In FY18 procure initial spare parts to support fielding and factory training of RADIAC Calibration Laboratory Electronic Technicians and program engineers.

[P40A / M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2500 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.

[P40A / M2600 - Laboratory Test Equipment]: M2600.  This Cost Code supports specialized equipment usually found in laboratories, hospitals and test facilities.  This kind of equipment is distinct enough to warrant separating it for management purposes from the M2400 Cost Code.

[P40A / Gamma Counter Upgrade]: M2600, Gamma Counter Upgrade:  This laboratory equipment provides the capability of detecting loose contamination and the advantage of distinguishing if there is beta or gamma radiation/contamination present in the area.  It provides automation in both the actual counting of samples and their automatic analysis.  The upgrade is to software and hardware to improve performance and increase functionality.  The upgrade will change the detecting medium to increase the counting efficiency.

[P40A / Calibrators]: M2600, Calibrators:  Calibrators are the basic tool used to calibrate all Navy radiological detection equipment.  They consist of a high energy radiological source (Cs-137) in a shielded container that is located in a specially constructed room, or "range." A technician places the instrument to be calibrated at a specific calibration point in the range and remotely operates the calibrator by raising the source out of its container so that the radiological source becomes exposed and it irradiates the instrument. The instrument's response to the radiation is measured so that it can be calibrated to specific tolerances. The current suite of AN/UDM-1B calibrators is over 30 years old, and the natural decay of the strength of the radioactive source over time restricts calibration effectiveness by limiting the scale of calibration points below American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements that are followed in accordance with Navy policy. Also, due to the age of the calibrators, there are several parts no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a malfunctioning calibrator (e.g., where the source gets stuck in the exposed position) poses a very high safety risk.

[P40A / Calibrator Initial Spare Parts &amp; Training]: M2600, Calibrator Initial Spare Parts &amp; Training:  Initial spare parts and vendor training at each of the seven RADIAC Calibration Laboratories where the equipment will be installed.

[P40A / M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2600 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for hardware acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code hardware acquisitions.

[P40A / M2830 - Support - Production Engineering]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government and contractor personnel who prepare the acquisitions.

[P40A / Production Engineering Carderock]: M2830, Production Engineering:  Labor cost of the government Engineers, Health Physicists, Scientists and others who prepare the acquisitions.

[P40A / Production Engineering ISEA]: M2830, Production Engineering In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA):  Labor cost of the contractor Engineers, Logisticians, Technical Writer, Program Analyst, and Systems Analysts who help prepare the acquisitions.

[P40A / M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee]: M2830 NWCF Contract Service Fee:  The PCO for acquisitions is a Navy Working Capital Fund activity that charges a set fee for each contract award and modification.  The applicable fee for a given year is applied to the total value of the Cost Code services acquisition.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20 (10 CFR 20) requires RADIAC instruments be used to ensure the safety of personnel who work with or are exposed to radioactive materials in their work.  Additionally, the Navy's mission requires personnel and ships to have the ability to operate in radiological environments and the ability to identify and interdict radiological Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Navy programs that require RADIAC instruments for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (OSH) reasons under the provisions of 10 CFR 20 include Naval Nuclear Propulsion, Nuclear Weapons, Medical, and Radiological Affairs Support.  Non-OSH programs include Radiological Defense, Consequence Management, Training, Technical (RADIAC calibration, shielding evaluation, research, etc.) and Radiological Search (maritime interdiction to locate or intercept WMD).</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) is the Navy's only Program of Record to replace existing afloat networks and provide the necessary infrastructure for applications, systems, and services to dominate the cyber warfare domain. CANES is the technical and infrastructure consolidation of existing, separately managed afloat networks including Integrated Shipboard Network Systems (ISNS), Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System - Maritime, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Networks, and Submarine Local Area Network. These legacy afloat network designs are currently End of Life and CANES will replace these unaffordable and obsolete networks.

The fundamental goal of CANES is to bring Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service, within which current and future iterations of Navy Tactical Network computing and storage capabilities will reside.  CANES will provide complete infrastructure inclusive of hardware, software, processing, storage, and end user devices for Unclassified, Coalition, Secret and SCI for all basic network services (email, web, chat, collaboration) to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants, submarines, Maritime Operations Centers (MOC), Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSC) and Aircraft. In addition, hosted applications and systems inclusive of Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Information Operations, Logistics and Business domains require the CANES infrastructure to operate in the tactical environment. Integrating these applications and systems is accomplished through application integration, the engineering process used to evaluate and validate compatibility between CANES and Navy-validated applications, systems and services that will utilize the CANES infrastructure and services. Specific programs, such as Distributed Common Ground System - Navy, Global Command and Control System - Maritime, Naval Tactical Command Support System, and Undersea Warfare Decision Support System, are dependent on the CANES common computing environment to field, host, and sustain their capability because they no longer provide their own hardware. CANES requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) field prior to or concurrently with CANES due to architectural reliance between the two programs.

CANES will develop technical updates on a rolling four year hardware baseline and a two year software baseline to ensure no cyber security vulnerabilities exist due to hardware and software obsolescence.  Fielding of CANES hardware and software baselines will be in alignment with the Chief of Naval Operation's Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP).  Technology refresh of existing CANES systems will be inclusive of both the latest CANES hardware and software baselines and will be executed on each ship no later than every six years.  CANES is based on the overarching concept of reducing the number of afloat networks and providing enhanced efficiency through a single engineering focus on integrated technical solutions. This will allow for streamlined acquisition, contracting, and test events, and significant lifecycle efficiencies through consolidation of multiple current configuration management baselines, logistics, and training efforts into a unified support structure.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The FY18 increase in the CANES funding profile optimizes a larger percentage of Chief of Naval Operations ship availabilities to mitigate heightened cyber security threats across Navy tactical networks and supports the Deputy Secretary of Defense direction to remove End of Life (EOL) Windows Operating Systems software from the Fleet as quickly as feasible.  Microsoft's end of cyber security support for legacy versions of Windows, as well as networks that rely on obsolete hardware and software, are driving increased sustainment costs, reducing operational availability and creating critical cyber security vulnerability in Navy Tactical Networks. Replacing these legacy networks and modernizing the tactical environment with CANES is the cornerstone for all C4ISR investments. The program has demonstrated a robust production and installation industrial base capable of executing the planned work in FY18.  A reduction in this investment results in increased operational risk to legacy network sustainment and leaves the Navy's tactical domain vulnerable to existing and projected near term nation-state cyber threats.

FY 2018 - CANES funds are for the procurement of (24) Afloat production units (2 Force Level, 11 Unit Level, 11 Subs), (13) Technical Insertion units (1 Force Level, 9 Unit Level, 3 Subs), and (1) Afloat First Article, with integration and associated costs for pre-installation design and the installation of (13) Afloat production units and (11) Technical Insertion units. CANES funds will also be used for the procurement and installation of (1) Ashore production unit.

It is important to note that procurement quantities across the FYDP are the same CANES end item products referenced in CANES LI 2915. Installation quantities represent sites receiving CANES as also referenced in LI 2915. The associated dollars in this exhibit represent the MIP portions of the CANES enclave.

The decrease in average unit installation cost from FY17 to FY18 is due a reduced number of more expensive Force Level (CVN, LHD) units in the FY18 installation plan. FY17 quantities were adjusted from PB17 due to fact of life fielding plan changes driven by installation availability schedules, resulting in a different mix of platforms procured and installed.

This procedure allows installations to be scheduled in the first quarter, supporting Fleet availabilities.  -CANES installations are conducted across several fleet concentration areas supported by six installation Multiple Award Contract (MAC) holders. The SPAWAR Installation Management Organization (IMO) has ensured sufficient Alteration Installation Teams (AIT) resources are available to meet the FY18 - 22 CANES installation plan.  -CANES Afloat production units require an additional 4 months after delivery for integration, assembly and testing prior to installation start.  Installations do not begin until 10 months after contract award (6 months production lead time (PLT) + 4 months integration). Total lead time, including admin lead time, is 11 months.  -The procurement average unit cost fluctuation is due to variance in system configuration requirements for each CANES platform type.  Furthermore, because CANES production units and installations are procured through separate multiple award contracts, there are unit cost fluctuations associated with the contracting process.  A CANES unit level platform (DDG/CG/LSD) requires a smaller system, supporting fewer users and applications than force level platforms with a greater number of users and applications. For example, a CANES DDG design consists of 18 equipment racks and ~400 workstations, while a CANES CVN system consists of 48 equipment racks and ~3000 workstations. The average procurement cost (hardware, software, integration, and engineering support) for a unit level ship ranges from $5.2M to $7.5M, while the average procurement cost for a force level platform ranges from $11.8M to $15.6M, and submarine unit procurement costs range from $2.7M to $4.6M. These costs include both the MIP and non-MIP components of the CANES units.  -Installation cost fluctuations are attributed to and dependent on ship class, variant of predecessor system the hull currently has installed. As an example of variant differences, if a CVN has an ISNS Delta variant installed, a CANES installation is estimated to be $18.2M. If that same CVN had  a legacy Asynchronous Transfer Mode Local Area Network (ATM LAN) the CANES installation is estimated to be $22.4M.   -FY17 quantities were adjusted from PB17 due to fact of life fielding plan changes driven by installation availability schedules, resulting in a different mix of platforms procured and installed.">1.1.1) CANES - Afloat Production Units - MIP - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

Total lead time, including admin lead time, is 11 months.">1.1.2) CANES Afloat Technical Insertion - MIP - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

First articles are separate from production units and must be bought prior to the procurement of the corresponding production units. Procurement Lead Time (PLT) is 8 months for First Articles (DDG,CVN, submarines, etc). All following production articles of the same variant require a PLT of 6 months. CANES First Articles are not installed. Average unit cost fluctuations are attributable to variances in system configuration requirements among platforms. A DDG/CG/LSD (unit level platforms) has fewer users and runs fewer applications than a LHD/CVN/LPD (force level platforms). Force level platforms are larger in scale compared to the unit level ships and represent a super set of users, applications and connected systems. The FY15 and FY17 units are Unit Level procurements. The FY16 procurement is a force level system.">1.2.1) CANES - Afloat First Articles - MIP - Organic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>This program provides for the initial procurement and distribution of General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE).  This equipment is essential to the operational readiness of the Navy for repair, installation, and maintenance (preventive and routine) of electronic systems and equipments, both afloat and ashore.  The GPETE procured must meet rigid technical requirements, be cost effective and satisfy valid deficiencies in authorized allowance. Within the TMDE program, GPETE is classified under 4 functional groups: Fiber Optics (M600), Signal Generators (M6001), Oscilloscopes &amp; Meters (M6002), and Passive/Ancillary/Mechanical (M6004). The program also breaks out a fifth cost code (M6003) for non-equipment (i.e. labor) tasks including engineering, procurement and integrated logistics support. The TMDE program procures Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS; i.e. non-government manufactured test equipment that is available to the general public) GPETE to address the maintenance requirements across shipboard/shore- based activities and programs. Approximately 80% of the annual test equipment requirements are procured through the DOD Supply System, or MILSTRIP, process. When the program procures through MILSTRIP, DLA or NAVSUP WSS fills the requisition. The remaining 20% of procurements are Simplified Acquisition Purchase (SAP) contracts or purchase card (P-card) buys. SAP and P-card requisitions are utilized only for obsolete test equipment that is no longer available for procurement through MILSTRIP. Any variance in unit costs and quantity across fiscal years is attributable to the diversity and varying complexity of the Commercial-off-the-Shelf GPETE to be procured from year to year to address the maintenance requirements across shipboard/shore- based activities and programs.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL) provides network interface capability, wideband encryption, and command link upgrades to the Communication Data Link System (CDLS).  Primarily, NTCDL provides multiple networked, simultaneous links to support surface to air, air to surface, air to air, and surface to surface platform Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) communications, where CDLS is a single link, point to point, air to surface/surface to air capability. The current NTCDL program budget begins in FY22, and supports the fielding of NTCDL Increment 1 on surface platforms to include CG, DDG, LCS, CVN, LHA, LHD, LCC.

Communication Data Link System (CDLS) Technical Refresh (TR) provides fielding link management computer upgrades to meet Fleet Windows 10 Operating System IA requirements, a second 360 degree data link, as well as the inclusion of digital distribution of ISR, Full Motion Video (FMV), and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) data in both Cypher Text (CT) and Plain Text (PT) to Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) for shipboard dissemination to support Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD). Supports various Common Data Link (CDL) air platforms including MH-60R, MQ-4 Triton, MQ-8B/C Fire Scout, P-3, P-8, and Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) vehicle, to include command and control of the aircraft during flight operations. The CDLS TR upgrade includes Flight Deck Checkout test link between aircraft on the deck through CDLS to end-user prior to flight operations to ensure End-to-End connectivity of organic assets prior to missions.

Link 16 Antenna will be applied as part of the back-fit modification that are intended for the Expeditionary Mobile Base-3 and 4 (formerly Mobile Landing Platform Afloat Forward Staging Base - MLP-3 and 4 AFSB) to handle various special operations mission sets after delivery.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 Funding supports procurement and installation of 4 Communication Data Link System (CDLS) Technical Refresh (TR) systems for CVN platforms. Due to increased fleet Common Data Link (CDL) operations and obsolescence issues, a technical refresh is required to extend the life of the system beyond its intended design. CDLS TR addresses whole system reliability, sub-component obsolescence, and emerging Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) Fleet requirements that are significantly degrading Fleet readiness, including Operational Availability (Ao), and system supportability. CDLS TR also provides IA/Cyber security upgrades to Windows 10 OS.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program supports various Navy Land Based Test Sites (LBTS) required to support integration and interoperability testing. Sites include, but are not limited to: Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Dahlgren, Surface Combat System Center (SCSC) Wallops Island, and NSWC Dam Neck.

The United States Navy has a requirement to fully test and certify computer programs for maturity, Interoperability and Integration (I&amp;I) prior to delivery to the Fleet.  Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (CFFC) provided specific direction to develop a unified modernization process and certify all combat system baselines for integration and interoperability as an integral step in the CNO Optimized Fleet Response Plan (O-FRP). Various Navy facilities, serving as LBTS, conduct the required testing in support of CVN, DDG, CG, LHD, LHA, LPD17 and LSD class ships. These sites also comprise the Navy's Distributed Integration &amp; Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) (supported through the use of JMETC network) alliance, which performs Interoperability Assessment and Systems Engineering Events (SEEs) for deploying Strike Groups.

These facilities also provide combat system in-service support to respond to emergent fleet problems. This capability tests and certifies new combat system baseline in a lab based environment, which has significantly reduced the cost of corrective action and shifted the burden of problem discovery away from the operator at sea.  It also provides support to the acquisition community to conduct interoperability (shift to the left) testing earlier in the acquisition cycle. 

As existing system experience parts obsolescence issues and tech refresh updates, the LBTS must procure and install existing test beds to accurately replicate the Command, Control, Communication, Computer, Combat System and Intelligence (C5I) configuration that are designed for the fleet. In addition, new combat systems architectures are under development for new ship classes such as LCS, CVN 78, DDG 1000, as well as new Open Architecture (OA) variants of legacy suites. Procurement of production representative systems of these OA combat systems being delivered to operational fleet units is critical to ensure that testing and subsequent certification of both current and newly installed combat systems is in accordance with NAVSEAINST 9410.2 Naval Warfare Systems Certification Policy (NWSCP) and the O-FRP Program.

The basic procurement outlined herein is directed at expanding various facilities capability to support Interoperability Integration and Stressful Endurance testing. Procurement requirements are directly tied to the interoperability testing schedule and establish independence between test beds allowing for parallel certification efforts. Procurements are required to build the necessary test beds and for laboratory support equipment. This budget procures lab support equipment that various facilities are able to support the new tactical subsystems that use COTS equipment. 

In addition, the basic program provides for equipment/upgrades for the Navy's Distributed Integration &amp; Interoperability Assessment Capability (DIIAC) needed to conduct interoperability assessment testing. The DIIAC consists of 14 land based sites networked to certify computer programs prior to their delivery to the fleet and provides support to the acquisition community to conduct interoperability and integration (shift to the left) testing earlier in the acquisition cycle. Interoperability Assessment and Stressful Endurance testing is required for all deploying strike groups per the Joint Fleet Instruction.

[P40A / M8400 - SESEF Electronic Equipment]: The Shipboard Electronic Systems Evaluation Facilities (SESEF) are Navy owned and operated test sites. The SESEF Program mission is to provide electromagnetic system tests and evaluations to afloat and shore commands for upgraded systems, to validate system performance following new construction and overhaul/availability, and to provide real-time assessment of material readiness in an operational environment. Also provided are: system modernization and integration, system and equipment component procurement and software (S/W) upgrades for test systems to include for Tactical Control and Navigation (TACAN), Antenna Radiation Pattern systems (ARP), Information Friend or Foe (IFF),  Direction Finder (DF)/Radio Direction Finder (RDF), LINK 11/16, Electronic Warfare/ Electronic Attack (EW/EA) and HF/VHF/UHF communication systems including secure voice. SESEFs have been used effectively to conduct TACAN certifications, support AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare (EW) Planned Maintenance System (PMS), Ship Signals Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) and to detect and isolate shipboard system deficiencies leading to maintenance action to increase ship material readiness at the completion of construction, delivery availabilities, during routine ship operations, and prior to deployment.

[P40A / M8500 - Interoperability Assessment Equipment]: M8500 - INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT EQUIPMENT KNOWN AS DISTRIBUTED INTEGRATION &amp; INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT CAPABILITY (DIIAC) Procures upgrades to support the 14 sites that comprise the Navy's DIIAC sites. Procures hardware that provides the DIIAC Operations Center (DOC) the ability to support monitoring and execution of events providing data collection and distribution. Funds are also allocated for site upgrades to meet current standards and allow scalability for DIIAC requirements. In addition, to enable the DIIAC to maintain efficiency and product improvement to interface with other Joint communities using Joint Mission Environment Test Community (JMETC) network.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Funding supports procurements and installations for the modernization of the eight operational sites across the AORs to support the surface fleet spectrum requirements.  FY17 and follow on funding requirements are to maintain the upgrades conducted in FY16 and the addition of the 8th site in Guam.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The EMI Control Instrumentation Program is supported by OPNAV N2N6, OPNAV N95, OPNAV N96, OPNAV N97 and OPNAV N98. The EMI Control Instrumentation Program provides Cradle to Grave Systems Engineering for Mission Assurance by implementing Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) hardware solutions, Spectrum Management (SM) software solutions, and by procuring specialized test equipment used in the characterization/quantification of EMI problems aboard US Navy platforms. This ensures equipment, systems, and platforms meet their Operational Mission Requirements and goals within their intended operational Electromagnetic (EM) environment. 

MA004 - EMI (HARDWARE) FIXES: Procurement and installation of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Hardware Solutions (i.e. Fixes) will achieve Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) among and between shipboard electronic/electric systems and/or equipment. This will be accomplished by determining the optimal EMI fix hardware, evaluating the effectiveness of the EMI solution, then procuring and installing the required hardware with full integrated logistic support (ILS) as part of the system hardware (ECP, OA, FC, etc). The fixes may include various types of radio frequency (RF) filters, limiters, blankers, radar absorbing material (RAM) and shielding methods.  MA004 - EMI (Hardware) Fixes is supported by OPNAV N95, OPNAV N96, OPNAV N97 and OPNAV N98.

MA104 - EMI (SOFTWARE) FIXES: Procurement and installation of EMI Software Fixes for platform/strike group/Area of Operation. These specific spectrum procedures (software application capabilities) and frequency management techniques (software modules) will be used to eliminate and reduce EMI when hardware solutions are unacceptable. Funds will also be used to provide engineering support to the enhancement of spectrum software applications through the procurement of models and other capabilities, including ILS for software tools/utilities/applications that correct/mitigate operational EMI.  MA104 - EMI (Software) Fixes are supported by OPNAV N95, OPNAV N96, OPNAV N97 and OPNAV N98.

MA204 - EMI CONTROL INSTRUMENTATION:  EMI Control Instrumentation will procure specialized test equipment used in the characterization and quantification of EMI problems aboard US Navy platforms. In addition, instrumentation will be procured for use in identifying the sources of EMI and determining the extent of EMI so that effective corrective measures can be applied.   The instrumentation procured will include automated and special EMI test equipment (e.g., for spectrum analysis, mapping field intensities, etc.).  EMI Control Instrumentation can include both hardware and software products that will enhance or streamline data collection efforts, including the ability to provide remote access capability.  MA204 - EMI CONTROL INSTRUMENTATION are supported by OPNAV N2N6.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>OPN Funds are used to procure and install (P/I) EMI Fixes on deploying ships and submarines.  The number of EMI Fixes procured, MA004 Hardware Fixes, are dependent on the number of ships/subs in the fleet and when they deploy.  Between FY2017 and FY2018, according to the Ship and Aircraft Supplemental Data Tables (SASDT) force structure projections for the US Navy, there is an overall increase in commissioned ships/subs of 8 (i.e., 296 to 304).  EMI Hardware fixes vary in cost; based on complexity, and ship/sub class/types.  The increase in cost for MA004 will cover the projected increase in EMI Fix P/I requirements for FY2018.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>[P40A / DC004 CALIBRATION STANDARDS]: These funds procure calibration equipment for intermediate and organizational maintenance levels. Test And Monitoring Systems (TAMS), which include test equipment and gauges, must be calibrated to ensure the equipment is operational, accurate and precise. Funds are used to procure Calibration Standards. Calibration Standards are equipments which ensure the accuracy of test equipment used to install, align, and maintain all navy weapons systems shore and afloat. Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) mechanical standards programs provide various new and replacement calibration equipment for instrument repair and calibration shops aboard tenders and shore based intermediate maintenance activities. The shipboard gauge calibration program provides the organization maintenance level aboard ship with portable calibration equipment to provide calibration support in only specific areas of measurement. Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment) computer-based system that provides real-time, on-line machinery condition monitoring and failure detection, diagnosis, trending for failure prognosis and expert troubleshooting capability. ICAS is linked through data networks to other critical ship systems, such as machinery control, damage control and bridge systems to receive necessary sensory information.

[P40A / DC019 RADAR RESTORATION AN/SPS-67 ANTENNA]: Funding in this line establishes an antenna manufacturing capability at Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane needed to provide additional rotatable pool antennas and associated engineering changes for the AN/SPS-67(V)3 to support the restoration of installed fleet antennas. The current number of available antennas is insufficient to support the fleet population. This has led to antennas operating in the field beyond their periodicity, resulting in decreased detection and tracking capability.

[P40A / DC020 DUAL BAND RADAR (DBR)]: Funding is required to establish the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA), Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) production services and support for Configuration Management.  Funding also implements the DBR Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) and infrastructure, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) Plan, associated hardware and software obsolescence mod kits, procurement of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs), associated logistics products and on-board allowance requirements to enable system operation. Production Support is also required to assist with DBR Combat System Integration and Technical Documentation. Additional limitations will be identified during CVN78/DDG1000 Shipboard Activation, Integration and At-Sea Testing. Additionally, as a result of DBR land based testing at the Wallops Island Engineering Test Center (WIETC) limitations were identified in the Dual Band Radar (DBR) performance that directly impacted CVN 78 and DDG 1000 class readiness.  These limitations require ECPs to correct the performance areas of the radar for Air Traffic Control and Integrated Combat Systems (e.g., False Clutter Tracks, Short Range Tracking, General Tracking, Slow Air Tracking, Waveform Scheduling, and code stability).   The Prime Contractor and Government Technical Team have documented critical radar issues that require correction via ECPs in FY17-FY21. Funding for these ECP efforts increases in FY17 due to the engineering and technical complexity of the change proposal needed to satisfy combat system qualification requirements.

[P40A / DC021 AN/SPS-67(V)5 MARITIME RADAR PROCESSOR (MRP)]: The Maritime Radar Processor (MRP) was developed to improve the detection of small boats/targets by USN ships. Funding in this line will be used to integrate and field small boat detection software improvements to AN/SPS-67(V)5 Surface Search Radar.

[P40A / DC022 RADAR RESTORATION MATERIAL]: DC022 - Radar Restoration Materials - Funding in this line procures components to support radar restoration (AN/SPS-48 Arrays and miscellaneous Antenna Sub-Assemblies) and Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to address obsolescence and improve supportability.

[P40AMOD / DC001 - SPS-73 RADAR]: The AN/SPS-73(V) Radar provides navigation and general surface search radar functionality on all U.S. Navy ships.  The AN/SPS-73(V)12 is the Program of Record (POR) Automatic Radar Plotting Aid (ARPA) Navigation Radar for the U.S. Navy.  Funding will be utilized for engineering changes which will improve surface combatant's ability to engage fast attack craft/fast in shore attack craft (FAC/FIAC) tracking and periscope detection and discrimination, as well as addressing cybersecurity shortfalls and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence of the legacy AN/SPS-73 systems.   The AN/SPS-73 Next Generation Surface Search Radar (NGSSR) will update the current AN/SPS-73(V)12 and may in the future obviate the need for the AN/SPS-67(V) and all Commercial Navigation Radars fielded in the fleet. Next Generation non-recurring engineering (NRE) has increased in FY17-FY21 due to the revised program direction to mitigate fast attack craft/fast in shore attack craft (FAC/FIAC), to address cybersecurity shortfalls and to capitalize on periscope detection and discrimination capabilities.

[P40AMOD / DC015 - TACTICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSOR (TEP)]: Provides real-time valunumeric wind profiles, convective weather detection/display, and radar refractivity assessments from AN/SPY-1 radar returns.  TEP will be an adjunct processor and display, tapping radar data from weather and refractivity data, with users able to access information through Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR).  TEP installations began in FY13, are aligned with AEGIS Modernization in FY14 and will continue beyond the FYDP.

[P3A - 2 / DC009 - AN/SPS-48G RADAR OBSOLESCENCE AND AVAILABILITY RECOVERY (ROAR)]: The AN/SPS-48G 3-D Air Surveillance Radar is a follow-on to the existing AN/SPS-48E onboard Aircraft Carriers and large-deck Amphibious ships.  AN/SPS-48G was initiated in response to Fleet complaints regarding AN/SPS-48E reliability and supportability.  Upgrade of the AN/SPS-48E with the AN/SPS-48G remains a high Fleet priority as it will reduce Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs and improve Operational Availability.  Both factors are cited by the Fleet as unsatisfactory for the AN/SPS-48E.  The goal is to replace the AN/SPS-48E as rapidly as possible so the Fleet can realize these cost savings.  Current efforts include the manufacturing of the AN/SPS-48G upgrade kits with associated production support as well as modifications to the AN/SPS-48G brought about by initial Fleet introduction and Fleet operations. Production lead time is 24 months for the initial unit with subsequent units delivered at two month intervals after initial delivery. Equipment delivery for installation is required thirty days prior to FMP availability start in accordance with Navy Modernization Process Management.   Engineering Change Order funding is included to address Fleet recommended modifications/ requirements and Information Assurance, Obsolescence, and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  FY13 and beyond Engineering Change Proposal funding is to initiate incorporation of High Diver Detection and Tracking functionality. This capability was designed and incorporated into the AN/SPS-48E after design of the AN/SPS-48G had been initiated. This change now needs to be translated into the different hardware and software architectures of the AN/SPS-48G. The variances in FY17 and FY18 ECP, ECO, Production Support, and Installation costs from PB17 are due to realignments that were caused by more accurately matching the budget to the actual installation schedule for LPDs 22 and 23, and by the need to fund completion of Information Assurance, High Diver, and AEM/S functionality requirements.

[P3A - 5 / DC018 - AN/SPY-1 RM&amp;A IMPROVEMENTS]: DC018 AN/SPY-1 RM&amp;A IMPROVEMENTS - These Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&amp;A) improvements are intended to reduce cascading failures, mitigate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability in support of Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions while still providing AN/SPY-1 Radar Total Ownership Cost (TOC) reductions. The improvements include, but are not limited to, installation for Sidewall Capacitor Circuit Protection and 10kW Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) Monitoring Circuits Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTS) for AN/SPY-1; B (V), D, D (V), OUCG and DDGs. Solid State Switch Assemblies (SSSA) will replace legacy switch tube modulator deck via an ORDALT.  Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) is the signal processor for the AN/SPY-1 radar.  MMSP Refresh (MMSP-R) cabinets will be procured to provide production representative configurations for land-based testing and training to support AEGIS ships at AEGIS Training and Readiness Center (ATRC) and Surface Combat System Center (SCSC) Wallops Island.  Increased funding in FY18 includes the procurement of two MMSP-R cabinets for Virginia sites, procurement of assets and shock qualification testing of SSSA and SPY-1D(V) Final Power Amplifier (FPA) cabinet required by MILSPEC 901-D.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: AN/SPS-73

The AN/SPS-73(V) Radar provides navigation and general surface search radar functionality on all U.S. Navy ships.  The AN/SPS-73(V)12 is the Program of Record (POR) Automatic Radar Plotting Aid (ARPA) Navigation Radar for the U.S. Navy.  Funding will be utilized for engineering changes which will improve surface combatant's ability to engage fast attack craft/fast in shore attack craft (FAC/FIAC) tracking and periscope detection and discrimination, as well as addressing cybersecurity shortfalls and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) obsolescence of the legacy AN/SPS-73 systems.   The AN/SPS-73 Next Generation Surface Search Radar (NGSSR) will update the current AN/SPS-73(V)12 and may in the future obviate the need for the AN/SPS-67(V) and all Commercial Navigation Radars fielded in the fleet. Next Generation non-recurring engineering (NRE) has increased in FY17-FY21 due to the revised program direction to mitigate fast attack craft/fast in shore attack craft (FAC/FIAC), to address cybersecurity shortfalls and to capitalize on periscope detection and discrimination capabilities.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>The AN/SPS-48G 3-D Air Surveillance Radar is a follow-on to the existing AN/SPS-48E onboard Aircraft Carriers and large-deck Amphibious ships.  AN/SPS-48G was initiated in response to Fleet complaints regarding AN/SPS-48E reliability and supportability.  Upgrade of the AN/SPS-48E with the AN/SPS-48G remains a high Fleet priority as it will reduce Operation and Support (O&amp;S) costs and improve Operational Availability.  Both factors are cited by the Fleet as unsatisfactory for the AN/SPS-48E.  The goal is to replace the AN/SPS-48E as rapidly as possible so the Fleet can realize these cost savings.  Current efforts include the manufacturing of the AN/SPS-48G upgrade kits with associated production support as well as modifications to the AN/SPS-48G brought about by initial Fleet introduction and Fleet operations. Production lead time is 24 months for the initial unit with subsequent units delivered at two month intervals after initial delivery. Equipment delivery for installation is required thirty days prior to FMP availability start in accordance with Navy Modernization Process Management.   Engineering Change Order funding is included to address Fleet recommended modifications/ requirements and Information Assurance, Obsolescence, and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  FY13 and beyond Engineering Change Proposal funding is to initiate incorporation of High Diver Detection and Tracking functionality. This capability was designed and incorporated into the AN/SPS-48E after design of the AN/SPS-48G had been initiated. This change now needs to be translated into the different hardware and software architectures of the AN/SPS-48G. The variances in FY17 and FY18 ECP, ECO, Production Support, and Installation costs from PB17 are due to realignments that were caused by more accurately matching the budget to the actual installation schedule for LPDs 22 and 23, and by the need to fund completion of Information Assurance, High Diver, and AEM/S functionality requirements.  

Installation funding for advanced planning (AP) and planning yard design services allocation (DSA) is required up to one year prior to the year of installation.  DSA funds are used for Ship Installation Drawings (SIDs), Alteration Installation Team (AIT) contracting fees, and shipchecks.</proc:Description>

Additionally, procurement costs increased due to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) component price increase. ORDALT kit quantities decreased in FY18 from 7 to 4 due to higher kit costs. Installation costs for Sidewall and 10KW TWT DDG Hardware increased due to additional shipyard costs being incurred in FY16 which was used as a basis of estimate for FY17-18 shipyard cost estimates. Production lead time for SWCs and 10KW are different. Production Lead Time for TWTs is 12 months. Production Lead Time for SWCs in FY16 and FY17 is 20 months due to major vendor manufacturing requalification.

                    <proc:Description>DC018 AN/SPY-1 RM&amp;A IMPROVEMENTS - These Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RM&amp;A) improvements are intended to reduce cascading failures, mitigate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability in support of Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) missions while still providing AN/SPY-1 Radar Total Ownership Cost (TOC) reductions. The improvements include, but are not limited to, installation for Sidewall Capacitor Circuit Protection and 10kW Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) Monitoring Circuits Ordnance Alterations (ORDALTS) for AN/SPY-1; B (V), D, D (V), OUCG and DDGs. Solid State Switch Assemblies (SSSA) will replace legacy switch tube modulator deck via an ORDALT.  Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP) is the signal processor for the AN/SPY-1 radar.  MMSP Refresh (MMSP-R) cabinets will be procured to provide production representative configurations for land-based testing and training to support AEGIS ships at AEGIS Training and Readiness Center (ATRC) and Surface Combat System Center (SCSC) Wallops Island.  Increased funding in FY18 includes the procurement of two MMSP-R cabinets for Virginia sites, procurement of assets and shock qualification testing of SSSA and SPY-1D(V) Final Power Amplifier (FPA) cabinet required by MILSPEC 901-D. 

Installation costs for Sidewall and 10KW TWT DDG Hardware increased due to additional shipyard costs being incurred in FY16 which was used as a basis of estimate for FY17-18 shipyard cost estimates.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Funding provides for the procurement and installation of Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems and IW and MUOS capable upgrade kits.  DMR with IW and MUOS capable hardware is a four or eight-channel software defined radio that provides satellite communications, Line of Sight (LOS) and High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) communication capability to surface, submarine, and shore facilities.  This variant of the DMR, including upgrade kits, provides hardware that is IW/MUOS compatible, and will allow for IW and MUOS software update when the development and integration is complete.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 funding of $3.77M was realigned from OPN 3010 to RDTEN 0604280N  in order to complete the testing and delivery of DMR IW and MUOS SATCOM capability, the Navy's technical solution for the IW/MUOS requirement.

FY18 funding provides for the procurement of 29 Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable upgrade kits and 7 IW and MUOS capable DMR systems.</proc:Justification>

Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable Digital Modular Radio (DMR) Systems. Quantities between radios and kits may change from year to year as a result of ship availabilities and fleet priority.
FY18 Shore procurements reflect procurement of four (Qty 4) DMRs to support NCTAMS LANT relocation project. Installation costs will be supported by overall project dollars.
FY 18 is procuring three (3 QTY) Afloat units of DMR IW &amp; MUOS System. There are 4 different configurations of DMR IW &amp; MUOS System  (2 surface, 1 subsurface &amp; 1 shore) and 5 different configurations of DMR IW &amp; MUOS Upgrade Kit configurations (3 surface &amp; 2 subsurface). Annual Unit Cost variances are driven by system configurations.   

For the DMR IW &amp; MUOS System, the configuration ranges from 1 - 3 DMR systems and requires a unique set of ancillary equipment dependent upon ship class (racks, power amplifiers &amp; antenna upgrades). For example, a CVN requires 3 DMR systems and would need 4 racks to complete installation. When comparing to a small ship such as LCS, which needs only 1 DMR system and 2 racks to complete installation. A single DMR system will range in cost depending on the configuration and Economic Order Quantity Pricing relevant at time of contract award.

All ancillary equipment is procured via separate contracts that will be subject to re-compete over the next two years. Components are provided to SSC Pacific for integration, assembly and test which comprises the 24 month lead time.

In FY18 DMR program plans to procure 7 DMR systems (3 subsurface and 4 shore). 

Twenty four (24) month Production Lead Time (PLT) for DMR System delivery due to varying PLT's from multiple sub-component vendors that are then integrated into the final product. Seven (7) month Administrative Lead Time (ALT) for DMR System procurements allows for the identification and receipt of other customer funds in order to take advantage of favorable quantity pricing when available.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>Integrated Waveform (IW) and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable Digital Modular Radio (DMR) Upgrade Kits. Quantities between radios and kits may change from year to year as a result of ship availabilities and fleet priority.

[DMR IW and MUOS Upgrade Kits Procurement] There are 4 different DMR IW &amp; MUOS System configurations (2 surface, 1 subsurface &amp; 1 shore) and 5 different DMR IW &amp; MUOS Upgrade Kit configurations (3 surface &amp; 2 subsurface). Annual Unit Cost variances are driven by system configurations.   

For the DMR upgrade kit configuration ranges from 1 - 3 DMR systems and requires a unique set of ancillary equipment dependent upon ship class (racks, power amplifiers &amp; antenna upgrades).  A single DMR upgrade kit will range vary in cost depending on the configuration and Economic Order Quantity Pricing relevant at time of contract award.

All ancillary equipment is procured via separate contracts that will be subject to re-compete over the next two years. Components are provided to SSC Pacific for integration, assembly and test which comprises the 24 month lead time.

In FY18 DMR program plans to procure 29 upgrade kits (11 subsurface and 18 surface).

Twenty four (24) month Production Lead Time (PLT) for DMR System delivery due to varying PLT's from multiple sub-component vendors that are then integrated into the final product. Seven (7) month Administrative Lead Time (ALT) for DMR System procurements allows for the identification and receipt of other customer funds in order to take advantage of favorable quantity pricing when available.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Ship Communication Automation (52PQ):  With the evolution of afloat networks programs migrating into the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) program , the Ship Communications Automation budget line will continue to support Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Legacy Network Operation Rolling Tide (ORT), Command and Control Official Information eXchange (C2OIX) (formerly Tactical Messaging), and Shore Tactical Assured Command and Control (STACC) (formerly Tactical Switching) programs.

Automated Digital Network System (ADNS): ADNS provides routing, switching, baseband, configuration and monitoring capabilities for interconnecting naval and coalition enclaves worldwide. ADNS utilizes Commercial Off-the-Shelf/ Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) equipment and network protocols as specified by the joint technical architecture. ADNS Increment (INC) I provides ship to shore IP connectivity, separation of enclaves, reuse of unused enclave bandwidth, and ship to tactical shore IP connectivity. ADNS INC II provides capabilities of network to Satellite Communications, Load Balancing, Radio Frequency (RF) restoral, and Quality of Service (QoS) to include application prioritization, Traffic Management, compression and enhancements designed to maximize use of "effective" available bandwidth for surface, shore, and airborne platforms. ADNS INC III combines all Navy Tactical Voice, secure Communications Interoperability Protocol Inter-Working Function, Video, and data requirements into a converged IP data stream. This includes Secure Communication Interoperability- Protocol Interworking Function (SCIP-IWF) for secure telephony over IP. In addition, the INC III architecture will incorporates an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack and a Cipher-Text security architecture to align to the Global Information Grid (GIG) in order to mesh Navy tactical surface, subsurface, and airborne platforms into a single IP environment with gateway functions to joint and coalition networks. 

Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/Operation Rolling Tide (ORT): ORT is a Navy-wide cyber remediation effort to secure government databases and improve the overall security protocols for Navy computer networks. Specifically, Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT will fund planned legacy network upgrades and mitigate security vulnerabilities on the highest End of Life platforms that are not targeted to be replaced by a Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) system. These upgrades will mitigate known targeted cyber vulnerabilities and include eradication of old Windows Operating Systems, critical End of Life (EOL) firewalls and routers and improved anti-malware solutions. Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT will improve the networks ability to detect known and unknown vulnerabilities and attacks by upgrading sensor and monitoring technologies and accelerate post-attack containment and recovery. Starting in FY16, Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT transferred to LI 3050 from CANES/ORT under LI 2915.

Command and Control Official Information eXchange (C2OIX) (formerly Tactical Messaging): C2OIX consolidates the Tactical Messaging and Defense Messaging System (DMS) programs and manages the Official Information Exchange (OIX) of organizational record message traffic, providing sustainment support and modernization for all afloat and ashore platforms. The modernization effort within C2OIX for afloat platforms replaces older Naval Modular Automated Communication System (NAVMACS) that lacked adherence to current cyber security requirements.  It also automates and increases the speed and efficiency of handling organizational message traffic aboard ships and submarines, as well as replaces ten NAVMACS surface shipboard variants distributed across United States Navy (USN), Military Sealift Command (MSC) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) ships with a single shipboard variant.  The ashore component of C2OIX Project is the IP-based C2OIX Shore Gateway system.  C2OIX will virtualize all Government Official Information Exchange System (GOES) software suites on shore gateway UNCLASSSIFIED, SECRET and TOP SECRET message enclaves and provide an integrated Cross Domain Solution (CDS) at the two Naval Computer Telecommunication Area Master Stations (NCTAMS PACIFIC and NCTAMS ATLANTIC).  C2OIX shore and afloat will satisfy Navy record messaging requirements and implement products that are developed with an open system architecture.

Shore Tactical Assured Command and Control (STACC)(formerly Tactical Switching): STACC is the Navy's ashore Program of Record to consolidate and modernize the Tactical Ashore Network, including the Network Operations (NETOPS) /Enterprise Network Management System (ENMS), Internet Protocol (IP) Services, and Transport for Fleet Commanders and their forces, as well as coalition forces, into a single program across five enclaves: Unclassified, SECRET, Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System-Maritime  Navy Operations Center (CENTRIXS-M NOC), Sensitive Compartmented Information Networks Operations Center (SCI NOC), and Virtual Secure Enclave (VSE) Application Service Points (ASP). 

STACC ENMS provides the mechanism for dynamic managed real-time information assurance, security and vulnerability mitigation within the tactical ashore networks. Network Management provides users with access to geographical real-time network situational awareness of cyber threats; and provides the operators the ability to understand what is and is not normal on the network and provide a pre-emptive cyberspace capability to fight and win in a cyber-denied information environment. STACC IP service offerings provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), within current and future iterations. STACC's ashore infrastructure is comprised of hardware, software, computing/processing, storage, and automated patching for Unclassified, Secret, CENTRIXS-M NOC (used by Coalition), SCI NOC and VSE for all network core services to a wide variety of Navy surface combatants. STACC transports Navy tactical data, providing seamless fail over and recovery capability.STACC requires that Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) and Computer Network and Defense System (CNDS) field in conjunction with STACC to provide a complete end-to-end capability from shore-to-ship and ship-to-shore.

STACC's modernization plan is designed to eliminate cyber security vulnerabilities due to hardware and software obsolescence. STACC's systems are located in 5 regions, at 40 plus sites supporting the Fleet Commanders and their forces: 1)Eastern Pacific supporting Commander Pacific Fleet and Commander Third Fleet (Naval Computer &amp; Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMS PAC) and Naval Computer &amp; Telecommunications  Station San Diego (NCTS San Diego); 2) Western Pacific supporting Commander Seventh Fleet; 3) Indian Ocean supporting Commander Fifth (NCTS BAHRAIN); 4) European supporting Commander Sixth Fleet (NCTS NAPLES); and 5) Atlantic supporting US Fleet Forces Command, Commander Tenth Fleet and Commander Fourth Fleet (NCTAMS LANT); and Joint and Coalition Partners within each region. STACC systems will also be procured in support of NCTAMS LANT's new integrated Communications Center.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2018, ADNS funds are for the procurement of (22) INC III Afloat units, (42) INC III Afloat Technical Insertion units, (4) Ashore INC I/INC II units, and (6) Ashore INC III units, with integration, and associated costs for pre-installation design. In addition, the FY18 ADNS investment will fund installation of (18) INC III Afloat units, (42) INC III Afloat Technical Insertion units, (4) Ashore INC I/INC II units, and (6) Ashore INC III units. The increase in ADNS units is driven by the need to field additional ADNS capabilities required by other programs.   

In FY 2018, Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT funds are for the procurement of (11) Legacy Network Afloat ORT units and (2) Legacy Network Ashore ORT units. In addition, the FY18 Legacy Network ORT funds are for the installation of (12) Legacy Network Afloat ORT units and (2) Legacy Network Ashore ORT units.

In FY 2018 C2OIX will fund NAVMACS (11) equipment procurement and (11) installations with integration and associated costs for pre-installation design to replace old legacy equipment onboard ships and submarines.

FY18-FY22 Fluctuation in installation costs is due to cost decrease when C2OIX installations are combined with CANES installations.

FY18 funding for STACC to engineer, integrate, procure, and install hardware and software to: connect to Global Information Grid (GIG) Point of Presence and provide internal timing and synchronization; transition legacy serial transport to an IP environment; expand IP services (Unclassified, SECRET, CENTRIXS-M NOC, SCI NOC and VSE ASP) to include application hosting services and expand storage capability; and enhance Network Operations monitoring and management and ORT cyber remediation solutions to detect, deter and mitigate network threats.  STACC modernization is required at the five major regions, including the NCTAMS LANT new integrated communications facility. Increased funding is for for EHF transport from Navy Multiband Terminals to core tactical operational shore sites for ADNS Inc II and III ships/units; and equipment for the NCTAMS LANT new Communications Center.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: Tactical Messaging / C2OIX / NAVMACS

Command and Control Official Information eXchange (C2OIX) (formerly Tactical Messaging): C2OIX consolidates the Tactical Messaging and Defense Messaging System (DMS) programs and manages the Official Information Exchange (OIX) of organizational record message traffic, providing sustainment support and modernization for all afloat and ashore platforms. The modernization effort within C2OIX for afloat platforms replaces older Naval Modular Automated Communication System (NAVMACS) that lacked adherence to current cyber security requirements.  It also automates and increases the speed and efficiency of handling organizational message traffic aboard ships and submarines, as well as replaces ten NAVMACS surface shipboard variants distributed across United States Navy (USN), Military Sealift Command (MSC) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) ships with a single shipboard variant.  The ashore component of C2OIX Project is the IP-based C2OIX Shore Gateway system.  C2OIX will virtualize all Government Official Information Exchange System (GOES) software suites on shore gateway UNCLASSSIFIED, SECRET and TOP SECRET message enclaves and provide an integrated Cross Domain Solution (CDS) at the two Naval Computer Telecommunication Area Master Stations (NCTAMS PACIFIC and NCTAMS ATLANTIC).  C2OIX shore and afloat will satisfy Navy record messaging requirements and implement products that are developed with an open system architecture.</proc:Remarks>

Average unit cost fluctuations for procurement and installation are due to varying system configurations required for surface and submarine platforms. INC III units require 3 months integration, assembly, testing and shipping after delivery, prior to installation start.  Installs do not begin until 10 months after procurement contract award (7 months production lead time + 3 months integration).  First quarter installations reflected in the Installation Schedule are funded in the prior year to meet the requirement to fund installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work.  90 days are needed to provide sufficient time for the contractor to develop the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication.  This process allows installations to be scheduled in the first quarter thereby supporting Fleet availability.   In FY16, funding was realigned into BLI 3050 for Major Automated Information System (MAIS) transparency compliance. Prior year Procurement quantity were procured under BLI 2915, therefore BLI 3050 prior year procurement cost is $0.00. Whereas, the FY15 procurement installed in FY16 (23) and FY17 (3) is funded under BLI 3050.">1.1.1) Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) - Afloat- INC III - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

The associated installations for FY16 and FY17 procurements(27) are funded under BLI 3050.  First quarter installations reflected in the Afloat Installation Schedule are funded in the prior year in order to be able to fund the installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work. 90 days are needed to allow sufficient time for the contractor to plan the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication. This procedure allows installations to be scheduled in the first quarter thereby supporting Fleet availability.  Average unit cost fluctuations are attributable to variances in system configuration requirements among platforms.    The average procurement unit cost for larger deck unit level platforms range: $.1M-$5.7M. Smaller deck unit level platforms range: $.1M-$.6M. Installation cost fluctuations are attributed to and dependent on class, level of the platform, variant of predecessor system the hull currently has installed, geographic location of the installation, and length of the availability. Installation cost range: $.1M - $2.8M.">1.1.1) Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT Afloat - Equipment - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Description>Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/Operation Rolling Tide (ORT): ORT is a Navy-wide cyber remediation effort to secure government databases and improve the overall security protocols for Navy computer networks. Specifically, Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT will fund planned legacy network upgrades and mitigate security vulnerabilities on the highest End of Life platforms that are not targeted to be replaced by a Consolidated Afloat Networks &amp; Enterprise Services (CANES) system. These upgrades will mitigate known targeted cyber vulnerabilities and include eradication of old Windows Operating Systems, critical End of Life (EOL) firewalls and routers and improved anti-malware solutions. Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT will improve the networks ability to detect known and unknown vulnerabilities and attacks by upgrading sensor and monitoring technologies and accelerate post-attack containment and recovery. Starting in FY16, Legacy Network Cyber Resiliency/ORT transferred to LI 3050 from CANES/ORT under LI 2915.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Justification>NU239 - PORT NSW:  FY18 funding procures 136 portable Hand Held and 61 Man Pack radios. 

NU295 - Battle Force Tactical Network (BFTN):  FY18 OPN funding procures and installs 1 unit.

NU019 - EPLRS-DR/EMUT: FY18 funding procures and installs 8 units. A complete unit consists of one AN/VRC-114(V)2 radio mount, two RT-1949 (PRC-117G) radios, one RF-5055PS power supply, and associated equipment.  The quantity procured in any given year is determined by the fleet's demand signal and platform availability. In FY18, 8 platforms will receive the installation for additional capabilities. FY18 unit cost increase per radio is due to a cost increase on the PRP contract to cover the MUOS Firmware required for the radios.

NU385 - Expeditionary Mobile Base Special Operations Forces (ESB SOF):  FY 18 funding procures and installs radio antennas and bandwidth increase equipment (total of 13 antennas) in support of SOF upgrade for ESB 4.  The cost delta between the ESB 3 and ESB 4 are for the refurbished CBSP asset (ESB 3) vs new system (ESB 4) and the difference in labor rates (East Coast vs West Coast) for the Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) efforts.

NU790 - Navy Expeditionary FY18 funding is for procurement of service-common support communications and Automated Data Processing (ADP) equipment directly supports forward deployed SEALs.  Investment in communications equipment, to include but not limited to, portable hand held devices, man pack radios, ruggedized laptops, and encryption-decryption devices are essential to the readiness and battlefield effectiveness of NSW in winning the current fight against ISIS and other extremist elements.  Additionally, it  ensures the warfighter is optimally equipped with cutting edge communications equipment for the future fight.  

Increase reflects establishment and funding of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) service-common table of allowance (TOA) to begin correcting shortfalls and bring NSW forces into alignment with required outfitting standards in accordance with SOCOM-USN Memorandum of Agreement.  Naval Special Warfare requires an immediate  increase in procurement of tactical communications radios to replace legacy equipment that are rapidly approaching obsolescence and, more importantly, are in many cases, incompatible with modern communication devices in use by sister services and coalition forces.</proc:Justification>

                                    <proc:Name footnote="Production costs for LBUCS equipment vary due to unique site configurations. Since PB 17, the LBUCS bill of materials was finalized after conducting site surveys and completing LRIP installations and testing. The LRIP activities and site surveys demonstrated a need to adjust the unit cost for both BCA and BTS procurements.  LBUCS will procure all full rate production hardware in a single buy in FY2017 so that it may field through FOC with a standard configuration. LBUCS Transmit hardware components from COTS manufacturers are on short product lifecycles.   Cost and duration for LBUCS Broadcast Control Authority (BCA) installations are greater than Broadcast Transmitter Stations (BTS) due to complexity of the BCA system. Additionally, install costs for BCA equipment vary due to unique site configuration and mix of CONUS and OCONUS locations. For example, OCONUS (Puerto Rico, Australia, Japan, Iceland, Hawaii, and Italy) install costs are higher due to international coordination, modifications (e.g. international power modifications, travel and shipping.)   With FY17 funds, LBUCS will install 10 production and installation support facility systems for which the cost is significantly lower than the operational BCAs and BTSs, as no international coordination, modification, shipping or travel will be required. Additionally, several FY17 funded sites leverage LRIP equipment and require minimal modification to the existing structure.  LBUCS Transmit equipment and cables will be installed in racks and must go through acceptance and integration testing prior to installation. This process can take up to 15 months due to complexity of each site's unique system configuration and special considerations (For example, international power modifications, adjustments for space availability, and extended shipping times for OCONUS sites). Installation schedule was arranged to accommodate sites with shorter integration timelines first and longer integration timelines later. The 14 installations taking place in FY17 have shorter integration timelines and therefore can be installed at that point. Nearly all of the installations taking place in FY18 are at OCONUS sites which require additional integration time, coordination, travel, and shipping, and therefore must be procured in one year and installed in the following year.">Broadcast Keying Station (BKS)/Broadcast Control Authority (BCA) -- Procurement</proc:Name>

Procurement and Installation unit costs vary due to procuring and installing different components each fiscal year.   FY17 ANTENNA funding procures six (6) components:  one (1) bushing, three (3) tower lighting systems, two (2) Tower Lighting Isolation Transformers (TLIT), each on separate task orders on the same contract which awards in March. Specifically, the first item, one (1) tower lighting system, is delivered three months after award, two (2) tower lighting systems and the TLITs deliver eight months after award and the bushing delivers eleven (11) months after award. Therefore, only the first tower lighting system will be installed in FY17. The remaining items will install in FY18.  The bushing will be installed in Q4 of FY18 due to weather conditions and operational availability at NCTAMS LANT (Cutler, ME).    FY18 ANTENNA funding procures two (2) components:  One (1) base arc gap, and (1) bushing, both on separate task orders on the same contract which awards in March. Specifically, the first item, the base arc gap delivers three months after award and the bushing delivers eleven (11) months after award. Therefore, only the base arc gap will be installed in FY18.  The bushing will be installed in Q4 of FY19 due to assembly requirements prior to install, weather conditions and operational availability at NCTAMS LANT (Cutler, ME).">1.1.2) Antennas - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

Procurement and Installation unit costs vary due to procuring and installing different components each fiscal year.   FY17 TRANSMITTER funding procures a quantity buy of 35 Laptops with Windows 10 operating systems (configuration identical) to upgrade capabilities and comply with DoD CIO memo dated November 20, 2015 that directed migration to Windows 10 system by FY17. The Transmitter equipment procured in FY17 requires a 5 month lead time. After delivery, this equipment must go through certification and accreditation prior to install. This process takes 3-5 months and all equipment must have the same configuration baseline. Fifteen of the laptops will complete certification, accreditation, and installation in FY17 and the remaining 20 will install shortly after in FY18.    FY18 TRANSMITTER funding procures (9) components: (4) Network Switch and Link Protectors, (4) Solid-State Variable Power Amplifier Plates and (1) Auto-Tune Power Amplifier on separate task orders on the same contract which awards in January. Specifically, the first items, the Network Switch and Link Protectors and the Auto-Tune Power Amplifier deliver five (5) months after award and the Solid-State Variable Power Amplifier Plates deliver nine (9) months after award. Therefore, the Network Switch and Link Protectors and the Auto-Tune Power Amplifier will be installed using FY18 funding and are subject to site availabilities. The Solid-State Variable Power Amplifier Plates will install in FY19 due to assembly and shipment requirements prior to the installation.">1.1.3) Transmitters - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>PROGRAM COVERAGE:  The Submarine Communications Program mission is to create a common, automated, open system architecture radio room for all submarine classes.  The program provides for the procurement and installation of systems incorporating the technical advances of network centric warfare to allow the submarine force to communicate as part of the Battle Group.  The program addresses the unique demands of submarine communications, stealth, obsolescence issues and higher data rate requirements.

[P40A / L0035 Antenna Modifications]: - Antenna modifications provide for the procurement and installation of field change kits of legacy antenna equipment (OE-315, AN/BRA-24, AN/BRA-6B, BRT-1/1A). These modifications address performance issues, improve reliability and maintainability, decrease vulnerability, and provide cost effective technology refresh.  Modifications are applicable to all submarine classes (LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, OHIO SSBN/SSGN, and VIRGINIA) and are implemented on a Fleet priority basis. Procurement and Installation unit costs vary due to procuring and installing different components each fiscal year.

[P40A / L0099 Towed Buoy Antenna BRR-6/6B Reliability Improvements]: - The AN/BRR-6/6B Towed Buoy Antenna system is installed on the OHIO-class Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN). Each boat has two (2) towed communications buoys with the sole function of supporting Navy Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) strategic requirements, connecting the President of the United States (POTUS) to Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) communications reception for the strategic deterrent mission.  The  AN/BRR-6/6B Towed Buoy Antenna system receives transmission across the LF,VLF, HF frequency range.  The buoy system provides significant operational flexibility by providing a means to passively receive communications while remaining at depth with minimal impact on boat's maneuverability or detectability.   

The Towed Buoy Antenna BRR-6/6B reliability improvements provide for the procurement and installation of field change kits of the Towed Buoy Antenna BRR-6/6B to improve system performance (measured by operational availability Ao) and reliability (measured by mean time between failures MTBF); improvements are applicable to SSBN only. The Towed Buoy Antenna BRR-6/6B is a key component of the NC3 system and the primary means of receiving Emergency Action Messages (EAMs). 

The Antenna BRR-6/6B Reliability Improvements program does not follow a traditional acquisition life cycle. Procurement and installation unit costs vary due to the phased approach as prescribed in the AN/BRR-6/6B Towed Buoy Antenna Lean Event Final Report of 30 September 2011 for procuring and installing different components each fiscal year in order to meet platform installation availabilities without degrading SSBN operational readiness.

[P40A / L0097 Submarine Local Area Network (SUBLAN)]: Provides a robust shipboard backbone Information Technology (IT) network with multiple classification enclaves that, along with the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) and Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), provides end-to-end wideband connectivity to the global Defense Information System Networks (DISN)  (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network and Nonclassified Internet Protocol Router Network).  SubLAN is designed in accordance with the IT for the 21st Century fleet initiative, and thus SubLAN will support greatly improved connectivity to, and interoperability with, the carrier strike group (CSG) and expeditionary strike group (ESG) commander, thereby achieving network-centric warfare, and with shore commands.  The SubLAN network is enhanced for mission-critical tactical applications, and as such SubLAN forms the medium that will interconnect Sonar, Combat, Electronic Surveillance Measures, Radio, etc., and permits the seamless exchange of warfighting tactical data between these systems and with the CSG/ESG commander.  The SubLAN tactical backbone replicates the functionality of the United States Ship (USS) VIRGINIA class network architecture, allowing back fit of VIRGINIA class tactical subsystem modernization into existing submarines.  The SubLAN shipboard IT infrastructure is being designed as an all-Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), open-system architecture such that it will permit other electronic subsystem programs to rely on SubLAN for subsystem interconnectivity (rather than having each subsystem install its own IT network); the revolutionary approach of treating the shipboard network as a basic utility (like water, power and lighting) will support the efficient and economic modernization of the various electronic subsystems.

[P40AMOD / L0087 Submarine High Data Rate Antenna]: SUBMARINE HIGH DATA RATE (SubHDR) SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM - The Submarine HDR system provides submarines with antennas that have the bandwidth, gain, and flexibility to meet the stated Commander, Submarine Force, United States Atlantic Fleet/Commander, Submarine Force, US Pacific Fleet  (COMSUBLANT/COMSUBPAC) requirements for HDR communications in the Super High Frequency (SHF) and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) frequency spectrums. The Radome provides a watertight enclosure for the antenna and associated electronics, as well as being a transparent window for Radio Frequency, (RF) communication signals to pass through. This radome needs to be replaced with a newly designed radome because the existing radome is experiencing severe cracking after only 3 to 4 years of service, at which time it is required to be pulled from service in order to prevent an implosion. This new design will prevent those cracks from occurring.

[P3A / L0080 OE-538/BRC Inc 2]: OUTBOARD ELECTRONICS (OE)-538 &amp; OE-592 ANTENNA GROUP - The OE-538 System is currently installed on all submarine classes except SSBN. The OE-592 system is currently installed on SSBNs. The OE-538 Inc 2 consists of  two configurations: OE-538A and OE-538B. The OE-538A effort upgrades the OE-538 system from FY15-FY20 to support Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Link-16 Tactical Data Link and Iridium capabilities. The OE-538B efforts upgrades the OE-538A from FY20-FY27 to support Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam and GPS Military Coded capabilities.

[P3A - 3 / L0084 CSRR-SSBN (OHIO)]: COMMON SUBMARINE RADIO ROOM (CSRR) (L0084) - The CSRR is an interoperable submarine communications system operating within the Information Dominance architecture, which provides consistent and reliable two-way, modern, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity to joint and combined forces. This evolutionary system achieves unmatched capability, cost reduction, and future technology integration via a multimedia, circuit sharing, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based open architecture that serves as the shipboard automated communications control system. Procurement in this line is for the radio room workstations, chassis, Radio Frequency Distribution and Control System (RFDACS), common power supplies, power distribution units, cabling, mounting kits and ancillary components required to integrate communications equipment for submarines. The RFDACS technology update for LOS ANGELES class submarines brings COTS functionality and supportability to the submarine external communications system. The CSRR Program supports LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, VIRGINIA and OHIO (SSBN and SSGN) class submarines.

CSRR modernization activities bring new capabilities, address new requirements, resolve End-of-Life (EOL) and obsolescence issues or correct known system deficiencies.  The unit cost variance between the CSRR Increment 1 Version 3-6 is due to different capabilities/configurations. For example, CSRR Increment 1 Version 3 is a more complex upgrade to the CSRR suite. CSRR Increment 1 Version 4 is planned to address equipment obsolescence and EOL issues. CSRR Increment 1 Version 5 will be another more complex modernization to the CSRR suite. 

The Undersea Platforms Special Communications program provides a fully integrated and tested Low Probability of Intercept / Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) communications systems enabling command and control (C2) in an environment where traditional communications are not available, thereby reducing platform susceptibility of detection and attack by the adversary.

The Link 16 program provides an enhanced submarine communication system by providing a two-way Tactical Data Link (TDL) processing capability on all Submarine (Nuclear) (SSN), Guided Missile Submarine (Nuclear) (SSGN) and Ballistic Missile Submarine (Nuclear) (SSBN) platforms.  The Link 16 program provides submarine Command &amp; Control systems with Link 16 tactical network communications capabilities for situational awareness in a contested environment and is a key element in naval tactical networking.  The new technology ensures the submarine's continued ability to participate in network-centric warfare and exploit its inherent stealth capabilities in support of the Navy, Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3), Joint, and allied/coalition fight to achieve total battlespace information dominance.</proc:Description>

Procurement and installation unit costs vary due to the phased approach as prescribed in the AN/BRR-6/6B Towed Buoy Antenna Lean Event Final Report of 30 September 2011 for procuring and installing different components each fiscal year in order to meet platform installation availabilities without degrading SSBN operational readiness. FY16 procured 41 reliability improvements (34 Full Production Seated Switches, 2 Antenna/Amplifiers, and 5 Multi-Reconfigurable Training Systems (MRTS) modules) and the antenna/amplifiers unit cost was $153K which elevated the average unit cost.  FY18 will procure 134 reliability improvements ( 56 Antenna/Amplifiers, 66 Tow Cable Boxes, and 66 Tow Cables)  and 122 tow cables has an average unit cost of $40K, causing a unit cost decrease of $24.26 from FY 16. The unit cost fluctuation is based on procurement of completely different items and associated costs each fiscal year and is not related to inflation or prior year unit cost.

The number and class of submarines available in any given year are very limited and consequently, the ability to shift installations from one submarine to another is often not possible. Installation funds are required by the installing activity 3 months prior to the start of the installation. CSRR modernization activities bring new capabilities, address new requirements, resolve End-of-Life (EOL) and obsolescence issues or correct known system deficiencies.  The unit cost variance between the CSRR Increment 1 Version 3-5 is due to different capabilities/configurations. For example, CSRR Increment 1 Version 3 is a more complex upgrade to the CSRR suite. CSRR Increment 1 Version 4 is planned to address equipment obsolescence and EOL issues. CSRR Increment 1 Version 5 will be another more complex modernization to the CSRR suite.">1.1.3) Equipment - Mod Kits Increment 1 Ver 4 - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>The Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Systems P-1 line provides funds for procurement of shipboard terminal equipment for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and ship-to-aircraft tactical communications via earth orbiting relay satellites.   This includes Radio Frequency (RF) equipment and baseband equipment assembled and grouped into systems and subsystems structured to address specific naval communications requirements. These systems provide modem processors and peripheral equipment that control the RF links for message traffic, direct data transfer and secure voice communications.  They are selected and oriented by communications traffic levels, types of communications and operational missions. Technical refresh of system modems will directly support Assured Command and Control (C2) posture, SATCOM reliability, space resiliency via band diversity and redundancy.

[P3A / (NR117) Global Broadcast Service (GBS)]: GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE (GBS - NR117): GBS is a Joint Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) program with the Air Force as Executive Agent for all services. GBS provides a continuous, high speed, one way information flow of high volume data to units ashore, afloat or special operations. GBS supports routine operations, training and military exercises, special activities, crises, situational awareness, weapons targeting, reconnaissance and the transition to and conduct of opposed operations short of nuclear war. Deployment of GBS internet protocol (IP) terminals will allow expanded use of military intelligence collection in a broader spectrum using MILSATCOM architecture. The Navy GBS Split IP effort enables near-real-time duplex asymmetric communications connectivity to ships/subs. GBS plays a pivotal role in an Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) scenario.

[P3A - 2 / (NR112) Commercial Broadband Satellite program (CBSP) - Afloat]: The Navy's next generation Commercial Satellite Communications (SATCOM) program provides the only source of wideband SATCOM to Patrol Coastal (PCs) and Mine Countermeasure Ships (MCMs), diversity for MILSATCOM on Unit Level Variant (ULV) ships, and augments MILSATCOM on Force Level Variant (FLV) ships. CBSP will support the procurement and installation of a commercial terminal and service architecture that significantly increase data throughput, Navy Anti-Access Area Denial posture, and SATCOM reliability and space resiliency by providing band diversity, assured access, and redundancy for MILSATCOM. Included in the program are Small Ship Variant (SSV - Patrol Coastal or Mine Countermeasure Ships), Unit Level Variant (ULV - examples are Guided Missile Destroyers or Guided Missile Frigates), and Force Level Variant (FLV - large combatant ships such as carriers).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 continues the procurement and installation of Global Broadcast System (GBS) Afloat Receive Terminals as well as the procurement of GBS Turn Key Portable Receive Terminals.  FY18 begins procurement and installation of modem technical refresh, and continues procurement of Force Level Variant (FLV) Commercial Broadband Satellite Program (CBSP) terminals.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) System provides funds for procurement of ship, submarine, and shore protected and wideband Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) terminals via earth orbiting relay satellites in the Super High Frequency, Ka, and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) bands. The NMT provides warfighters with the assured, jam resistant, secure SATCOM for message traffic, data transfer and secure voice communications. These procurements are scheduled to meet the satellite communications requirements established by the Chief of Naval Operations in the Fleet Communications Planning and Programming documents.

NAVY MULTIBAND TERMINAL (NMT - NS108):  The NMT program is the next generation maritime military satellite communications terminal.  The NMT Program is the required Navy component to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Program for enhancing protected and survivable satellite communications to Naval forces.  NMT multiband communication capabilities will communicate two way Ka-Band on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and shipboard and submarine terminals to communicate with X-Band using the Defense Satellite Communications System and WGS.  NMT is compatible with today's Navy Low Data Rate/Medium Data Rate  terminals, X-Band terminals and will sustain the MILSATCOM architecture by providing connectivity across the spectrum of mission areas, to include land, air and naval warfare, special operations, strategic nuclear operations, strategic defense, theater missile defense, and space operations and intelligence.  The NMT system will replenish and improve on the capabilities of both the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay System (MILSTAR) and WGS system by equipping the warfighters with the assured, jam resistant, secure communications as described in the Operational Requirements Document (Wideband Gapfiller System ORD, AFSPC ORD 004-99, May 3, 2000) for the joint AEHF Satellite Communications and WGS System.

The NMT protected system AN/WSC-9 V (Variant) is comprised of three configurations for ships, submarines and shore sites known as Communication Groups.  Terminal Communication Groups will integrate protected and wideband signal processing to multiband Antenna Groups.  The Antenna Groups align to the specific Terminal Variant for ship, submarine and shore platforms and provides the SATCOM capabilities known as Q/Ka and X/Ka assigned to platforms.  NMT includes the Advanced Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Interface Processor (IP) and supports increased data transfers for the Automated Digital Network System (ADNS) router architecture supporting improved Quality of Service (QoS) capability, smaller form factor and easier integration into operational environments, further supporting network user access to protected MILSATCOM connectivity.  Technical refresh of modems and the associated architectures will directly support Assured Command and Control (C2) posture, SATCOM reliability, space resiliency via band diversity and redundancy.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The NMT Budget has been restructured to identify and break out other costs previously consolidated against procurement and installation line items.  FY18 begins procurement and installation of Assured C2 modems, continues the procurement and installations of full NMT capability terminals and continues installation of the Advanced Time Division Multiple Access Interface Processor (ATIP) on ship terminals procured in prior years.  X/Ka back-fit and Ashore Antenna installations are provided on separate P3a sheets.</proc:Justification>

FY17 increased Install Average Unit Cost (IAUC) compared to FY18 IAUC accounts for infrastructure modifications required at NCTAMSPAC (Hawaii), NCTS (Guam) and NRTF (Awase, Japan).    2.  Procurement hardware pricing reflects Raytheon current contract pricing.  Integration, Assembly and Test (IA&amp;T)  and System Operational Verification Test (SOVT) engineering services are required to deliver and install the NMT Terminal System.  3.  FY18 Ashore IA&amp;T engineering services cost reflect delivery completion of FY15 procured terminals,  For larger quantity buys, the Procurement Lead Time (PLT) is 15 months to deliver the first terminal.  Deliveries continue over a 12 month period with the last delivery occurring 27 months after award. Apr 2016 marked the delivery of the first terminal and the last terminal delivers in Mar 2017.  4. SOVT engineering services cost represent completion of SOVT reports to coincide with the end of installation at the Shore sites.  Prior year equipment installed in FY16-FY18 is due to Fleet directed fielding schedule adjustments.  5. FY18-FY21 Ashore installation updates represent a re-prioritization of hardware units to support Afloat ship availabilities.">Ashore -- Procurement</proc:Name>

NMT Procurement budget updates include Integration, Assembly and Test (IA&amp;T).  IA&amp;T efforts are required once terminals and antennas are delivered from Raytheon Production Facilities to the government site SSC Atlantic, Charleston SC.  SSC Atlantic serves as the lead integrator and performs Pre-Installation, Test and Check-Out (PITCO) of the terminals, antennas and ATIPs required for NMT shore platforms.  NMT Installation updates are performed by SSC Atlantic and SSC Pacific, San Diego, CA to provide the System Operational Verification Test (SOVT) required to validate the NMT system is operational post installation on shore sites.

Fielded platforms with the Q/Ka configuration require an X/Ka backfit, which has additional costs dependent on platform (large vs small deck).  2.  FY17 increased Installation Average Unit Cost (IAUC) compared to FY18 IAUC is due to a CG Afloat Variant that requires a large antenna group and is double the cost of a small antenna group (ie DDG Ship Platform).  3.  FY16-FY18 Procurement Integration, Assembly and Test (IA&amp;T) engineering services cost are required prior to terminal delivery to platforms.  For larger quantity buys, the Procurement Lead Time (PLT) is 15 months to deliver the first terminal.  Deliveries continue over a 12 month period with the last delivery occurring 27 months after award.    4.  FY16-FY22 System Operational Verification Test (SOVT) costs represent the effort to operationally verify the capability following the completion of installation and are tied to the end of the installation availability.  NMT scheduled installations are dependent on limited ship availabilities as the program nears FOC.      5. Per Fleet Modernization Program (FMP) first quarter installations reflected in the Installation Schedule are funded in the prior year in order to fund the installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work. 90 days are needed to allow sufficient time for the contractor to plan the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication.">X/Ka Backfits -- Procurement</proc:Name>

FY18-FY22 continues the procurement of NMT terminals and installation of Advanced Time Division Multiple Access Interface Processors (ATIP) hardware.  Costs reflect Raytheon current contract pricing.  Installation costs are based on current program office estimates. Integration, Assembly and Test (IA&amp;T) and System Operational Verification Test (SOVT) engineering services are required to deliver and install the NMT Terminal System.    2.  IA&amp;T costs are budgeted in the year of the hardware delivery and support the completion of delivered terminals associated with larger quantity buys procured in prior years. Procurement Lead Time (PLT) is 15 months to deliver the first terminal.  Deliveries continue over a 12 month period with the last delivery occurring 27 months after award.  For example, the last terminal delivery from the FY15 prior year buy is scheduled March 2017. FY18-FY21 IA&amp;T costs support delivered terminals associated with FY16-FY20 procured terminals.   3.  The FY18 Ship Procurement Average Unit Cost (PAUC) is higher due to a single buy and reduced Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) savings.     4.  FY16-FY22 System Operational Verification Test (SOVT) costs represent the effort to operationally verify the system capability following the completion of installation and is tied to the end of the installation availability.  NMT scheduled installations are dependent on limited ship availabilities as the program nears FOC.      5.  Per Fleet Modernization Program (FMP) first quarter installations reflected in the Installation Schedule are funded in the prior year in order to fund the installation contracts 90 days prior to the beginning of shipboard installation work. 90 days are needed to allow sufficient time for the contractor to plan the work schedule, order material, and perform necessary fabrication.   6.  Install cost fluctuations are driven by the configuration of the NMT system and the platform type. For example, estimated installation cost for a LHD 1 class (large deck) platform with dual Q/X/Ka capability is approximately three times greater than a DDG 51 class platform (small deck) with the same Q/X/Ka capability. Large deck ships consist of 2 Terminal Communication Groups with 4, 5, or 6 antennas.  The antenna mix ties to the specific configuration requirement for each ship.  Small deck ships consist of 1 Terminal Communication Group with 2, 3, or 4 antennas. There are 13 variants of the NMT and antenna size varies by class (ranging from 54&quot; to 96&quot;).">1.1.1) Afloat Ship - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

NMT Procurement budget updates include Integration, Assembly and Test (IA&amp;T). IA&amp;T efforts are performed once terminals and antennas are delivered from Raytheon Production Facilities to the government site SSC Atlantic, Charleston SC.  SSC Atlantic serves as the lead integrator and performs Pre-Installation, Test and Check-Out (PITCO) of the terminals, antennas and ATIPs required for NMT ship and submarine afloat platforms.  NMT Installation updates include System Operational Verification Test (SOVT).  SOVT efforts are performed by SSC Atlantic, Charleston, SC and SSC Pacific, San Diego, CA and validate the NMT system is operational post installation on afloat platforms.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE) Program is responsible for procuring hardware and software to support Defensive Cyber Operations, Transport technologies (narrowband, wideband and protected satellite communications), C4 Architecture (network elements that provide access to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) cloud), and C2 On-The-Move (land, air and ground based tactical capabilities) in concert with Strategic Planning Guidance.  JCSE's Modernization Program is structured around Combatant Command (CCMD) requirements using emerging technologies. Services formally influence JCSE's acquisition plan through semi-annual program reviews and make recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid.

This line funds the Department of the Navy's portion of the JCSE Program.  This program is jointly funded by Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in support of Joint Tactical Force and Joint Special Operations Task Force Headquarters.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) ensures the protection of Navy and joint cyberspace systems from exploitation and attack.  Systems include wired and wireless telecommunications systems, cybersecurity systems, and the content processed, stored, or transmitted therein. ISSP includes protection of the Navy's National Security Systems (NSS).

The rapid change in the underlying commercial and government cyber infrastructures makes cybersecurity an increasingly complex and dynamic problem. ISSP provides the Navy's warfighter the essential information trust characteristics of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Cybersecurity capabilities must evolve quickly to meet the rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities.

Programs within the ISSP budget include:

P5 / Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):  PKI implements a secure infrastructure for the generation, management, and delivery of digital certificates for secure electronic transactions, hardware certificate-based two-way authentication to networks, applications, web servers, and secure email.  

P5 / Cybersecurity Virtual Secure Enclave (VSE): Cybersecurity VSE is the follow-on limited transition of capabilities from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) / Pacific Command (PACOM) sponsored VSE Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD). The technology provides a virtual secure enclave within existing networks that create a two-way encrypted tunnel between locations. Client Nodes (CN) and deployable Fly Away Kits (FAK) expand user level access to the existing system architecture which is required for the execution of various operational plans.

P5 / Navy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA): NCSA was previously budgeted under CND but broken out in FY18 for greater visibility into cybersecurity.  NCSA is a command and control infrastructure that provides Navy commanders with timely, trusted, and comprehensive Situational Awareness (SA) of the cyberspace domain to include tailored, near real-time visualization of network health, vulnerabilities, and operational readiness through the correlation of data from multiple sources.  NCSA enables early threat detection and timely decision making.  NCSA ashore systems will enable Navy commanders to monitor, assess, plan, and direct Navy networks to provide a high-level of confidence that operational missions can be executed as planned in adverse cyber conditions.  Cyber SA will be provided via web-accessible services generated from a primary core suite fielded at Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC).  Visualizations and analytics will be customized based on end user needs, shareable and tailorable between different end users.  End users include Fleet Cyber Command / Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC/C10F), Fleet Maritime Operations Centers (MOCs), NCDOC, and Navy Network Warfare Command (NNWC).  NCSA procures equipment to collect, curate, analyze, and visualize maritime Cyber Key Terrain (CKT) critical for providing Navy commanders with timely, trusted, and comprehensive SA of the cyberspace domain; Data as a Service (DaaS) which provides the ability to ingest disparate data from numerous data sources; Analytics suite of software and logic to integrate and translate the data ingested by the DaaS component; Visualization / user interface to display cyber SA data that are relevant to the unique needs of the Cyber Commander and for display via common visual services; as well as equipment for platforms conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications Navy (NC3-N) missions. The data that is collected and analyzed via SHARKCAGE will be presented and visualized via the NCSA capability.

P3A / Computer Network Defense (CND): CND provides capabilities to secure the Cyber Domain.  CND is a set of processes and protective measures that use computer networks to detect, monitor, protect, analyze and defend against network infiltrations resulting in service/network denial, degradation and disruptions. CND enables a government or military institute/organization to defend against network attacks perpetrated by malicious or adversarial computer systems or networks.

P3A / Navy Cryptography (Crypto):  Navy Crypto modernizes legacy cryptographic equipment which includes families of Communications Security (COMSEC) and Transmission Security (TRANSEC) devices that are divided into crypto voice, crypto data, crypto products and associated ancillary devices.  These devices provide modern cryptographic solutions to replace obsolete, legacy devices within the crypto categories.

P3A / Key Management (KM) is a collection of Tier 2 security equipment, Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), and Tier 3 equipment Simple Key Loader (SKL).  Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) will be a single, automated, network-accessible, electronic-based Key Management (KM) and predominantly electronic cryptographic product delivery infrastructure. It will provide Net Centric, reliable, timely, and secure Communications Security (COMSEC) material management and distribution. It will additionally provide the means for secure ordering, generation, production, distribution, management and auditing of cryptographic products.

P3A / SHARKCAGE:  SHARKCAGE is a global, federated Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) enclave consisting of shore sensor nodes, DCO analysis workbenches, and analytic nodes.  Utilizing one-way passive taps in a protected, isolated, classified environment, SHARKCAGE consolidates cyber event data from multiple platforms and networks, providing Navy DCO forces with a shared environment and common platform for integrated workflow, collaboration, and analysis.  SHARKCAGE efficiently detects, correlates, and analyzes nation and non-nation state attacks against maritime Cyber Key Terrain (CKT) and the Naval Networking Environment (NNE). The data that is collected and analyzed via SHARKCAGE will be presented and visualized via the NCSA capability.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Computer Network Defense (CND): CND provides capabilities to secure the Cyber Domain.  CND is a set of processes and protective measures that use computer networks to detect, monitor, protect, analyze and defend against network infiltrations resulting in service/network denial, degradation and disruptions. CND enables a government or military institute/organization to defend against network attacks perpetrated by malicious or adversarial computer systems or networks.

CND afloat systems that have not transitioned to Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) include: system and host-based protection tools, system vulnerability tools, cyber remediation tools, supporting hardware and software for Department of Defense (DoD) mandated tools, Operating System Environment (OSE), enhanced data correlation tools, switches, ancillary devices and other related security tools.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Key Management (KM) is a collection of Tier 2 security equipment, Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), and Tier 3 equipment Simple Key Loader (SKL).

KMI is the next generation Tier 2 product to replace the legacy Local Management Device/Key Processor (LMD/KP) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI includes the Management Client (MGC), Advanced Key Processor (AKP) and High Assurance Internet Protocol Equipment (HAIPE) devices. KMI provides a net-centric, web based architecture for the ordering, management and distribution of all cryptographic key material to support Navy users. KMI Tech Refresh will be required to upgrade all KMI Spiral 2 systems in a 5 year cycle. KMI Capability Increment (CI)-3 Spiral 3 will be the next capability build to replace KMI CI-2 Spiral 2.

The AN/PYQ-10 SKL is a ruggedized, portable, hand-held fill device, for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data between compatible cryptographic and communications equipment.  The SKL is backward-compatible with existing End Cryptographic Units (ECU) and forward-compatible with future security equipment and systems, including KMI.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Key Management (KM) ashore sites include: United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Coast Guard (USCG) facilities, production integration sites, and training sites. KM ashore systems include:  Simple Key Loader (SKL), Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) Spiral 1 &amp; 2 and KMI Tech Refresh.

KMI is the next generation Tier 2 product to replace the legacy Local Management Device/Key Processor (LMD/KP) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). KMI includes the Management Client (MGC), Advanced Key Processor (AKP) and High Assurance Internet Protocol Equipment (HAIPE) devices. KMI provides a net-centric, web based architecture for the ordering, management and distribution of all cryptographic key material to support Navy users.  KMI Tech Refresh will be required to upgrade all KMI Spiral 2 systems in a 5 year cycle. 

The AN/PYQ-10 SKL is a ruggedized, portable, hand-held fill device, for securely receiving, storing, and transferring data between compatible cryptographic and communications equipment.  The SKL is backward-compatible with existing End Cryptographic Units (ECU) and forward-compatible with future security equipment and systems, including KMI.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>SHARKCAGE procurements were previously budgeted under CND and have been broken out for greater visibility into cybersecurity beginning in FY18.

SHARKCAGE is a global, federated Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) enclave consisting of sensor nodes, DCO analysis workbenches, and analytic nodes.  Utilizing one-way passive taps in a protected, isolated, classified environment, SHARKCAGE consolidates cyber event data from multiple platforms and networks, providing Navy DCO forces with a shared environment and common platform for integrated workflow, collaboration, and analysis.  SHARKCAGE efficiently detects, correlates, and analyzes nation and non-nation state attacks against maritime Cyber Key Terrain (CKT) and the Naval Networking Environment (NNE).

SHARKCAGE Afloat Suite includes laptops, servers, switches, storage, network taps/cables, and forensic equipment to enable deployed DCO forces to conduct localized mobile analysis.  Afloat systems also include supporting hardware and software for enhanced data correlation tools, ancillary devices, and other related security tools.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>SHARKCAGE procurements were previously budgeted under CND and have been broken out for greater visibility into cybersecurity beginning in FY18.

SHARKCAGE ashore systems represent multiple SHARKCAGE architectures and variants that are specifically designed to each site in accordance with Fleet and Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) requirements based on emergent threats in the tactical environment.  Capabilities provided include network tapping, sensing, and analytic toolsets for passively monitoring multiple Navy networks to detect and assess cyber threats across multiple security enclaves.  Ashore sites include Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), Navy Information Operations Commands (NIOC), Fleet Cyber Command / Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC/C10F), Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications Navy (NC3-N) sites, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) sites (i.e., Aegis Ashore), and SHARKCAGE production labs, as well as other network concentration facilities.

Line item procures equipment to establish the SHARKCAGE Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) enclave to address emerging threats in the tactical environment.  Procurements within the SHARKCAGE equipment line include hardware and software such as servers, storage, taps, switches, laptops, accessories, and appliances that provide the following capabilities: passive network sensor nodes that collect live network traffic and use signature-based and heuristic intrusion detection systems (IDS) to conduct initial analysis and alerting; analytic nodes which consist primarily of systems supporting ingest, storage, retention, retrieval, correlation, and real-time alerting of network traffic packet capture (PCAP) and event data; and analysis workbenches which provide an environment and suite of tools for DCO analysts to support all aspects of the DCO mission, local to DCO forces at Fleet Cyber Command / Commander Tenth Fleet (FCC/C10F), Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), Navy Information Operations Commands (NIOC), Naval Computer and Telecommunications Stations (NCTS), and Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Stations (NCTAMS).  Hardware and software will also be procured to support platforms conducting Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications Navy (NC3-N) missions.

NCDOC Suite: The primary SHARKCAGE suite that supports the entire Navy enterprise and provides the capability to analyze active cyber threats and take actions to contain/stop actual or potential threat activities.

Analytic Site: Provide a regional/AOR capability to analyze active cyber threats and take actions to contain/stop actual or potential threat activities.

Sensor Site: Provide analysts with the ability to conduct data ingest, data storage, data retention, data retrieval, data correlation, and real-time alerting of event-based data to support the DCO mission.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>Computer Network Defense (CND) ashore systems represent multiple CND architectures/capabilities within each build that are specifically procured for each site based on the site mission and latest cyber threat.  CND builds and variants are specifically designed to each site in accordance with CND's rapid Information Technology (IT) fielding construct. Shore sites include IT for the 21st Century (IT-21) Networks Operation Centers (NOC), Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net) Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSC) and Local Network Service Centers (LNSC), Broadcast Control Authorities (BCA), Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC), and CND production labs. CND also provides ashore infrastructure to provision the latest cyber security updates to all afloat tactical units (including CANES, ISNS and other networks) and roll up data to NCDOC. CND will deploy technologies to shore commands and the shore-based afloat infrastructure to improve network defense and security wholeness, countering intruders and attacks aimed at disrupting tactical communications at the afloat gateways and shore commands; this will accelerate the Navy's ability to prevent, constrain, and mitigate cyber-attacks and critical vulnerabilities, as well as provide greater resiliency, awareness, data analytics, redundancy, and diversity into the Navy's Defense-in-Depth (DiD) strategy. CND shore sites will have modern network sensors, improving the ability to detect unusual network patterns and prevent/deter malicious attacks. The Virtual Training Environment (VTE) initiative supports equipment upgrades at the Navy schoolhouses. The Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) initiative replaces end-of-life equipment at NCDOC with more robust capability. CND will upgrade NCDOC's sensor grids and data correlation tools, and enhance the command's Cyber Defense Mission Support System (CDMSS) architectural framework to provide the necessary storage capability and processing power to ingest and analyze increased volumes of data from additional sources; NCDOC will then disseminate information to Navy decision makers as their roles require. CND will continue to support Cybersafe control points and protect IT-enabled systems.

CND Inc 2 ashore procurement/installation quantities represent multiple CND architectures with an assortment of builds that are specifically designed to each site. Costs vary by site and variant.

SHARKCAGE procurements previously budgeted under CND have been broken out into a separate P-3a for greater visibility into cybersecurity beginning in FY18.</proc:Description>

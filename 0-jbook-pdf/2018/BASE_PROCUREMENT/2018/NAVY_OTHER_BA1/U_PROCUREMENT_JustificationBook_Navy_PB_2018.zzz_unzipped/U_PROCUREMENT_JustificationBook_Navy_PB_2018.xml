            <proc:Description>Beginning in FY17, the Department established Surface Power Equipment BLI 0131 to consolidate the LM-2500 Gas Turbine BLI 0110 and Allison 501K Gas Turbine BLI 0120 along with their associated efforts into one budget line.

Program FY21 DFC procurement decreased quantity from five (5)to three (3) due to DDG modernization program schedule change.

Surface Power Equipment budget line provides life-cycle support for the following Marine Gas Turbine systems:

The General Electric LM2500 Marine Gas Turbine provides main propulsion for the Navy's surface combatants including the CG 47 TICONDEROGA Class, DDG 51 ARLEIGH BURKE Class, and LCS-2 (Austal) Class. The LM2500 is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The LM2500+ Marine Gas Turbine and its associated Engineering Control Systems provide main propulsion power for the Navy's amphibious assault ships including the LHD-8 USS MAKIN ISLAND, LHA-6 USS AMERICA and LHA-7 USS TRIPOLI. The LM2500+ is composed of two major sub-assemblies: the gas generator and power turbine sections. It is coupled to the ship drive-train by a high speed coupling shaft. The control system for both engines provides for both local and remote engine operations.

The Rolls Royce (Allison) 501-K Series Gas Turbines are used to drive electrical generators in Ship Service Gas Turbine Generators (SSGTG). The 501-K17 is used on the CG-47 Class ships. The 501-K34 is an upgraded version used on the DDG-51 Class ships and is not interchangeable with the 501-K17. The MT5S is a higher-power derivative of the 501-K engine family (utilizing Rolls Royce's new "Marine Trent" or "MT" naming convention vice the older "501-K" naming convention) used for auxiliary electrical generation on DDG-1000 class ships; the MT5S is not interchangeable with the 501-K17 or 501-K34. The Rolls Royce MT-30 is used on LCS-1 (Lockheed) Class for main propulsion and DDG 1000 for electrical generation. Rolls Royce 250-KS4 is used as a starter gas turbine for the 501-K34 on DDG 79 and follow.  The Rolls Royce MT7 gas turbine is used for both lift and propulsion fan power on the next generation of LCAC landing craft.

[P40A / PE014 Special Support Equipage]: PE014 Special Support Equipage Procurement of Special Support Equipment allows for increased depot repair capability, thereby stabilizing or reducing the cost to overhaul engines at the depot. This tooling is generally associated with depot modifications being made to the engine to increase engine reliability. This increased capability reduces engine overhaul costs.

[P40A / PE015 LM2500 DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL]: PE015 - DIGITAL FUEL CONTROL (DFC)This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG/DDG modernization schedules. Procurement and installations are budgeted to correspond with CNO ship availabilities. One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.   The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. This modification is estimated to be 75% more reliable than the old system. 
This upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft; with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall detection and shutdown capability.

[P40A - 2 / PE001 STOCK ROTATING SPARES]: PE001 - STOCK ROTATING SPARES
This cost code procures the MT-30 &amp; MT-5 gas turbines for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and Zumwalt DDG 1000 program, the 250-KS4 SSGTG starter engines for the DDG 79 and follow, and the 501-K34 gas turbines DDG 51 class ships. The procurement of these engines includes all required shipping/storage containers.

MT-30 Gas Turbines
Based on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 6 spares are required to support the fleet.  Current MT-30 spares on-hand is two (2), four (4) budgeted procurement in FY18-FY21.  The projected FY-22 and beyond in-service population of MT-30 gas turbine engines is fifty (50) due to new construction.

MT-5 Gas Turbines
Based on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 2 spares are required to support the fleet.  Current MT-5 spares on-hand is zero (0) with two (2) budgeted in FY18-FY19.  The projected FY-21 and beyond in-service population of MT-5 gas turbine engines is six (6) due to new construction. Earlier budget exhibits called for procurement of (1) MT-5 in FY19 and (1) in FY20.  The current budget calls for procurement of (1) MT-5 in FY18 and (1) in FY19.  This change was required because Rolls-Royce has indicated that production of the MT-5 will end before an FY20 procurement can occur.  The total requirement for (2) spare MT-5 gas turbines is unchanged

250-KS4 SSGTG Starter Engines
Based on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 12 spares are required to support the fleet requirements.  Current spares on-hand is twelve (12) which achieves the baseline sparing requirement.  The projected FY-18 in-service population of starter engines is 112 due to new construction. Operation Tomodachi has resulted in the radiological contamination of twelve (12) 250-KS4 Marine Gas Turbines, which created an unplanned requirement to replace the twelve (12) affected engines beginning in FY13.  Currently, the program has budgeted for six (6) replacements through FY22 with four (4) already procured, leaving a requirement of two (2) additional replacement assets to be procured.

501-K34 Gas Turbines
Based on experience with similar turbines and IAW 10 USC Sec. 2308, DFAR subpart 207.70 and DoDI 3110.06, a total of 26 spares are required to support the fleet requirements. Current 501-K34 spares on-hand is 22, which leaves a requirement of 4 additional gas generator units to be procured.  The projected FY22 in-service population of gas turbine engines is 222 due to new construction.

Each hull has a total of three (3) SSGTG units installed.  Each SSGTG is controlled by a Full Authority Digital Control (FADC).  CG-47 class uses the 501-K17 and DDG-51 class uses the 501-K34.  There are currently three variants of the 501-K34 SSGTG: AG9130, AG9140HF and AG9140RF. The AG9140RF also includes the Remote Independent Mechanical Starting System (RIMSS) consisting of the 250-KS4 engine.  The quantity of modification kits procured corresponds to the number of SSGTG units to be upgraded.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next.  The type and scope of each modification required will vary from one ship to the next. The number and type of kits installed in any given Fiscal Year (FY) varies depending upon ship availability schedules during that FY.   FY2017 budget of $4,571K funds; Ship Change Document (SCD) ; FADC HMI Upgrade, Qty 21, $1,415 - System upgrage; SCD 5216, Qty 24, $173 - FADC 2-1 Conversion; SCD 10677, Qty 9, $234 - Off-Eng Fuel Valve (CG47); SCD 12115, Qty 18, $213 - RIMSS Tachometer; AYB 9130-021R1/9140-018R1, Qty 99, $34 - HUM BRK.  The remaining balance is for ancillary materials related to each of the aforementioned SCDs.   The increase in the PE007 budget FY17 represents a change in the types and quantities of modification kits purchased from one year to the next; these changes are driven by ship availability schedule and include both procurement and installation costs.">2.1) PROCURE MODIFICATION KITS</proc:Name>

                    <proc:Remarks>This cost code procures the Digital Fuel Control (DFC) shipsets, ancillary equipment and install material to support the CG/DDG modernization schedules.
One DFC Kit is required to upgrade each of the four DDG class LM2500 engines, which makes one DFC shipset.
The DFC is the most significant change to the LM2500 engine since its inception into the USN that addresses obsolescence components which accounted for approximately 40% of all engine failures. In summary this modification is
estimated to be 75% more reliable than old system.
This upgrade replaces the existing Hydro-mechanical main fuel control (MFC) system which was designed for aircraft;
with a Digital Fuel Control (DFC) system designed for military marine environment. This modification increases engine reliability, decreases periodic maintenance, enhances operational functions, and provides an automatic stall
detection and shutdown capability.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) consists of an electric motor which can be coupled to the propulsion reduction gear to provide propulsion power from the ship service gas turbine generators (SSGTGs) during low speed operations. This will permit the securing of one or more propulsion gas turbines and allow higher power loading resulting in more efficient operation of the SSGTGs, which will be generating electric power for the HED as well as ship service power.  In addition to reducing fuel consumption and the associated costs, HED results in the additional benefits of increasing the ship's range, increased time on station performing its mission, and reducing the frequency of fuel replenishment.

The HED shipsets will include the propulsion motors, motor drives and the associated controls, interfaces, and mounting equipment that will be required to install the HED on DDG 51 Class Ships.  This budget supports the HED for installation on DDG 51 Class in-service ships beginning in FY17.

            <proc:Description>The FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $2.924 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program initiated in FY14 as a transfer of funding from BLI 5246, to allow the Navy to better align and identify Hull, Mechanical &amp; Electrical (HM&amp;E) requirements, shipboard upgrades and equipment in support of the in-service Surface Combatants to include Class Common Equipment to support shorter Regular Overhauls and Selected Restricted Availabilities, including Ship System Components that require long repair turn-around; CG/DDG - Machinery Control Systems (MCS) COTS Refresh; Ship Control Systems and installation in support of the Ship Control System.

[P40A / GB001 - CG/DDG COTS Tech Refresh]: Due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment must be periodically refreshed to ensure supportability to the Fleet. This cost code is used to fund solutions for HM&amp;E systems that have parts with oncoming DMSMS impacts. DMSMS solutions, including after-market manufacturing (reverse engineering), bridge-buys, life-of-type buys, modernization through replacement, modification / redesign, and reclamation are implemented to ensure that in-service ships are operational and sustainable throughout the life of the system. DMSMS issues and planned resolutions are implemented outside of standard CNO availabilities (WOO or CMAV) and are impacted by pending fact-of-life influences, including shifting availabilities, modified vendor End of Sale dates, and unforeseen material shortages.

[P40A / GB002 - Class Common Equipment]: The CCE program is to provide Ready-For-Issue (RFI) systems and equipment in support of Surface Combatant ship industrial availabilities, and to replace major system equipment which sustains battle damage or major failure.  CCE Availability Assets (AAs) ensure warfighting capability, readiness, and on-time deployment by providing RFI long lead time material (LLTM) in case of possible catastrophic damage or major failure on Aegis ships. CCE AAs are procured and stored to support backfit upgrades and emergent maintenance within brief availability windows.  The ready accessibility of these assets avoids delays in availability completion caused by lengthy equipment repair turn-around time or acquisition lead time.  In addition to availability assets, the CCE program also provides for Insurance Assets.  These are the major long lead time HM&amp;E equipment/systems which, due to major damage or battle damage, would prevent a ship from being able to be quickly repaired in order to accomplish its mission.  The CCE program provides for both CG and DDG assets.

[P40A / GB003 - Ship Control Systems (Installed under GB6IN)]: Funds provided support the procurement of Ship Control Systems (SCS) upgrades to be installed under GB6IN on both cruisers and destroyers in support of the Fleet Modernization Program. Ship Control Systems provide lifecycle support for legacy and modernized engineering controls. SCS equipment and components are procured for various ship changes and engineering change proposals for in-service surface combatants and are installed outside of standard CNO availabilities.  This effort includes maintaining Land Based Engineering Sites (LBES), CG / DDG system refresh, SCD design engineering, CG / DDG equipment procurement, and CG / DDG ISEA/ILS support.  This cost code also provides for funding the necessary software licenses in support of the HM&amp;E COTS systems/equipment for both CG and DDG class ships.  Examples of systems requiring software licenses are: Machinery Control System components, Voyage Management System, Integrated Bridge System, Integrated Bridge and Navigation System, and Digital Video Surveillance System.

[P40A / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Previously Procured in BLI 0110 and BLI 0120)]: Maritime Energy Initiatives provide surface combatants with technologies/tools that reduce energy usage. This will enhance operational capabilities, allowing for longer time on-station and fewer refuelings. These initiatives will also help meet the CNO's 2020 goal of reducing the surface fleet's fuel usage by 15%. The initiatives consist of:  1) Hull and Hydrodynamics - These initiatives focus on the dynamic forces where the ship contacts the water. They include, but are not limited to hull appendages that reduce drag, thus improving speed and fuel efficiency; 2) Power Generation and Transmission Systems - These initiatives focus on, but are not limited to improving the efficiency of ships' prime movers, generators, main reduction gears, propulsion motors/drives, and shaft-line components; 3) Combat and Ship Systems Support Services - These initiatives focus on, but are not limited to improving systems that use electricity when providing support services (e.g. cooling, heating, air, lube oil) to combat machinery, or life support systems; and 4) Decision Aids - These initiatives will inform the sailor of decisions they can make to save energy and improve operational efficiency by consolidating and manipulating ship data and providing it back as actionable information.

[P40A / GB6IN - HM&amp;E Installation (Procured under GB003)]: Funds provided support the installation of ship control systems upgrades (procured in GB003 CG/DDG) on both cruisers and destroyers in support of the Fleet Modernization Program. Installation funding supports expected service life and maintains the surface combatant's machinery and ship control systems. This functional code is also utilized to execute Maritime Energy Initiative installation tasks displayed on the P-3a exhibits.

[P40AMOD / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (TMCS)]: The Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is the largest distributed system on a Surface Combatant and typically consumes between 25% and 40% of all energy used.  Surveys on several DDG-class ships indicate that average space temperatures across the ship were being maintained well below the design temperature.  Thermal Management Control System (TMCS) provides centralized control and monitoring of space temperatures at design set-points for each compartment throughout the ship.  This technology enables improved operational efficiency of the HVAC system, thereby lowering AC loads and reducing electrical demand.

[P40AMOD / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Bow Bulb)]: Bow bulb is a near surface, small volume design for installation on the destroyer's bow in combination with the existing sonar dome.  Modification of bow shape reduces hull wave drag without an increase in hull resistance, reducing fuel consumption.

[P40AMOD / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (VSD for CPS)]: The Collective Protective System (CPS) is a full time air filtration system integrated into the ship's HVAC system.  The amount of outside supply air delivered to CPS zones varies with filter loading over time and is almost always higher than needed, resulting in above average HVAC loads.  Variable Speed Drive (VSD) will be installed as an airflow control component to optimize supply air flow, realizing energy savings from fan motor and reduced HVAC loads.

[P40AMOD / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (SSL)]: Solid State Lighting (SSL) lamps consist of individual Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which serve as replacements for incandescent and fluorescent lighting fixtures.  SSL replacements  are engineered to meet military specifications.  SSL replacements for incandescent and fluorescent fixtures reduce energy usage by approximately 85% and 50%, respectively.  Additionally, this install will drastically reduce the electrical lighting load, maintenance actions, and the space needed for spare parts.

[P40AMOD / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT IIA)]: The Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT IIA technology is a shipboard tool providing real time situational awareness of the energy demand associated with equipment lineup and mission.  Technology raises operator awareness of how certain engineering plant lineups and equipment affect fuel consumption rates.  Energy savings will be realized through energy usage culture change.

[P3A - 6 / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT I)]: The Shipboard Energy Dashboard FLT I technology is a shipboard tool providing real time situational awareness of the energy demand associated with equipment lineup and mission.  Technology raises operator awareness of how certain engineering plant lineups and equipment affect fuel consumption rates.  Energy savings will be realized through energy usage culture change.

[P3A - 7 / GB004 - Maritime Energy Initiatives (Triton Fuel Penalty)]: Triton Fuel Penalty is a system capable of reporting in real time when a ship's powering condition has degraded due to increased drag from bio fouling.  Personnel will be able to schedule ship cleanings utilizing feedback taken from actual measurements of drag while in service. This capability will reduce the current penalty paid by the fleet to overcome the negative effects of biological fouling on ship performance and fuel expenditure.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>The Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is the largest distributed system on a Surface Combatant and typically consumes between 25% and 40% of all energy used.  Surveys on several DDG-class ships indicate that average space temperatures across the ship were being maintained well below the design temperature.  Thermal Management Control System (TMCS) provides centralized control and monitoring of space temperatures at design set-points for each compartment throughout the ship.  This technology enables improved operational efficiency of the HVAC system, thereby lowering AC loads and reducing electrical demand.

                    <proc:Remarks>Solid State Lighting (SSL) lamps consist of individual Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which serve as replacements for incandescent and fluorescent lighting fixtures.  SSL replacements  are engineered to meet military specifications.  SSL replacements for incandescent and fluorescent fixtures reduce energy usage by approximately 85% and 50%, respectively.  Additionally, this install will drastically reduce the electrical lighting load, maintenance actions, and the space needed for spare parts.

            <proc:Description>Note: Submarine Electromagnetic Systems including Imaging, Electronic Warfare and Radar programs are managed by PMS435. Imaging Budget Line Item 0831 and Electronic Warfare Budget Line Item 2560 (including Radar) OPN funds will consolidate under BLI 0840 in FY17 and out.

The Submarine Periscopes and Imaging Equipment Program procures the Type 18 and Type 8 periscope upgrades; all variants of Photonics Mast (PM), including Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM) and 360 degree imaging capability and incorporates it in the Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS), and VIRGINIA Class imaging upgrades and Photonics land based spares. Commander Naval Submarine Force (CNSF), Operations Review Group (ORG) selected the Periscope Acquisition, Tracking, and Ranging with Improved Observation Techniques (PATRIOT) Type 18 Periscope Rangefinder and the Night Owl Type 8 Infra-Red (IR) Periscope as high priority tactical control technologies to field. By OPNAV Ltr Ser. N77/3U629209, 12 June 2003, OPNAV N87 established the ISIS to rapidly field these systems and integrate existing periscope imagery systems into a single system for installation on board submarines. An ISIS capability development document (CDD) was approved 22 Dec, 2011. The CDD is used to fully integrate the ISIS program of record into the submarine force's rapid insertion technology process and to incorporate Fleet-endorsed requirements such as LPPM that are not levied by the ISIS Operational Requirements Documents. ISIS supports high intensity operations in the littorals, providing the submarine force with the tactical imaging systems necessary to safely and effectively employ its surveillance and weapons capabilities. The IR imaging capability improves imaging at night and in low visibility conditions. The PATRIOT Automated Range Finder provides a 360 degree search independent of the visual search, enhanced situational awareness and provides a collision avoidance capability. Tactical Imagery Technology Insertion (TI) includes the common control and displays hardware and software on all platforms regardless of imaging sensors, an integrated imaging system that provides for operator alerts, imaging enhancement tools and contact analysis tools, and a fully Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) integrated system providing "any display anywhere." Funding improves submarine imaging capability in the areas of: ship safety, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), tactical control (contact management in the littorals) to provide high quality imaging 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in all weather conditions to support submarine operations worldwide. ISIS provides for the modernization of imaging systems to improve imaging capabilities for the submarine force in support of ISR requirements. This includes the integration of new capabilities, both inboard hardware and software, into the Type 18 and Type 8 Periscopes for LOS ANGELES Class and SEAWOLF Class submarines, the Photonics Mast Variant (PMV) for SSGN, and Photonics Mast upgrades to the VIRGINIA Class AN/BVS-1 including the AN/BVY-1 ISIS capability and LPPM.

PL010 - Imaging ISIS Technical Insertions - Continuing in FY17 funding procures Imaging systems and Technical Insertion kits and spares to upgrade ISIS systems on LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, VA and OHIO Class SSGN platforms to allow for Capability Insertion and obsolescence avoidance. FY16 procurement also adds funding for improved copper-fiber optic diploops and hull penetrators required to support advanced Imaging and Early Warning capabilities included in Low Profile Photonics Mast and future 360 degree Imaging masts.

PL011 - Imaging Block Upgrades - FY17 funding continues procurement of Periscopes and Imaging Equipment reliability, capability, and maintainability upgrades, e.g., Eyepiece Box, periscope mechanical hoisting mechanism upgrades, inboard electronic processing hardware and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), Robust Surveillance Program, Certification of regional repair centers for Imaging System maintenance and technical data.

Type Modification: SHIPALT

VA Class advanced Low Profile Imaging masts including Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM). Procures initial modernization assets as well as spare masts later in FYDP to maintain overall spares ratio for imaging masts as quantity of imaging equipped ships increases. Maintaining sufficient quantities of installed and spare low profile masts imaging is essential to meet PACFLT requirements for all deploying VA class submarines in the Pacific to be equipped with low profile imaging masts. Beginning in FY20, procurement of Task Oriented Tech Insertion Mast (TOTIM) will provide vastly increased capability, reduced maintenance costs and increased development flexibility for new mast sensors.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>Provides for the modernization of Imaging systems and Technical Insertion kits to upgrade Integrated Submarine Imaging System (ISIS) on LOS ANGELES, SEAWOLF, VIRGINIA and OHIO Class SSGN platforms in support of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements.  VIRGINIA Tech Insertion unit costs reflect copper/fiber diploops and hull penetrators needed to field Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM) and the Task Oriented Tech Insertion Mast (TOTIM) on these modernization hulls as well as higher base unit cost of VIRGINIA Tech Insertions.  VIRGINIA Initial ISIS Backfits also contain copper/fiber updates for those hulls.  This line item aligns the periscope, imaging, and support equipment with the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) interface with the Combat Control and Acoustic upgrades in budget line items 5420 and 2150.</proc:Description>

As a result, there is a slight increase to the FY18 unit cost.  In addition, higher unit costs in the out-years are realized for FY20 as TI20 systems are procured in conjunction with TI18 systems.  FY21 increases because only TI20 systems are being procured.  FY22 increases as procurement of the more expensive TI22 units begin.  The installation costs for 2 SWFTS Kits procured as part of the PB17 Request for Additional Appropriations (RAA) will be addressed in PB19 submission.

                    <proc:Description>TI Processor upgrade provides additional computing capability over previous TI baselines and replaces out of production systems for installation on LOS ANGELES, SSGN, SEAWOLF, and VIRGINIA Class submarines.  Provides updates to the AN/BLQ-10 (V) configuration baseline which incorporates current Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) processing technology and software to account for obsolescence avoidance, and Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) and associated Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) and technical data. Hardware builds include supporting platform level Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) interfaces.

Capability and Technical Insertion for AN/BLQ-10(V) provide spiral improvements to the baseline system which are designed to counter against new and evolving threat emitters.  This effort is the transition of the EW AN/BLQ-10 TI modernization process to synchronize with SWFTS TI/APB process and model.

TI-16 baseline represents a significant change and increase in capabilities to enable software processing of digital data provided by EW Next Generation Architecture (NGA) hardware. TI-16 introduces the EW Server system that centralizes in software many functions that were previously handled in older, less capable hardware systems. Vastly increases coordination and dissemination of data.

Due to proliferation of  multiple, older TI configurations, TI-16 still required to procure significant hardware updates to baseline older systems prior to installing new capabilities.


TI-16 is a concurrent requirement for installing EW NGA hardware.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Procurement of AN/BLQ-10B(V) NRE and modernization kits for ES Modernization upgrades for all submarine platforms. The rapid proliferation of complex radar, communications and navigation equipment available to potential adversaries creates a need for sustained and significant improvements to submarine systems in order to maintain tactical ship safety and operational effectiveness. Commander Submarine Forces and the Submarine Tactical Requirements Group (STRG) raised EW primary mission area in FY12 to be the number one modernization requirement. In addition, each procurement aligns with hardware builds supporting platform level Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) interfaces.


FY18 AN/BLQ-10B(V) Next Generation Architecture (NGA)(TI-16/18) Backfit procurements reflect kits to be installed in conjunction with TI-16 and TI-18 modernization. AN/BLQ-10B(V)NGA (TI-16/18) Backfit procured jointly with NAVAIR and the US Army leveraging prior NAVAIR funded development and providing a common hardware set for synergistic software solutions to be developed and shared between all three programs. 

FY19 procurement of the AN/BLQ-10B(V)NGA (TI-20) Backfit in conjunction with TI-20 modernization.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The DDG Modernization Program is required to upgrade the in-service Flight I, II, and IIA DDG-51 Class ships in order to keep them relevant and affordable components of the Navy's Sea Power 21 Plan.  The DDG Modernization Program is composed of a series of improvements in both the Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) and Combat Systems (CS).  The modernization installations are planned for each ship at approximately the midlife point for each hull.  The quantity line represents the total DDG Modernization availabilities (HM&amp;E and Combat Systems) started in each fiscal year.  HM&amp;E: 3-2-6-5-4-3-4 Combat System: 1-1-2-1-3-2-3. Large funding increase in FY 18 due to the increase in DDG Modernization installations from 2 in FY 17 to 6 in FY 18. 

The HM&amp;E modernization will be comprised of the technologies transitioned from SCN funded DDG 111/112 and those additional improvements required to support the expected service life of the DDG 51 Class.  The upgrades will focus on technologies that reduce workload and Total Ownership Costs (TOC) for the remaining hull life of each ship.

The centerpiece of the CS modernization is the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) upgrade.  This upgrade will consist of the introduction of displays, computing equipment and the computer program required to implement Aegis Open Architecture (AOA) and replacement of the existing SPY-1D Signal Processor (SIGPRO) with the Multi-Mission Signal Processor.  Selected warfighting improvements will also be installed in conjunction with the combat systems upgrade.   This modernization program will provide a core modernization of the infrastructure "foundation" of each ship including the core engineering plan, core computing plan, and Combat Information Center (CIC).  This modernization program will also provide an infrastructure foundation that will function as a landing zone for future warfighting capabilities.

                    <proc:Remarks>Digital Video Surveillance System (DVSS) is a network of video cameras which are integrated into the Machinery Control System.  This system is primarily a watch-stander situational awareness tool which supplements the workload reduction benefits of the new MCS.

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Remarks>

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Remarks>

Installation costs across the FYDP may vary depending on current port rates. Port rates are updated every year by a Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Centers (CNRMC) letter based on the forecasted port loading model. Port loading rate forecasts are the rates recommended for all budgeted maintenance and organic modernization within a specific port.

Individual ship's availability durations vary dependent upon the integration of ship's maintenance and modernization work packages. 

Procurement costs for FY 16 &amp; FY 17 are shown in Conjunctive Alteration Definition and Integration P40-A. Installation cost for FY 16 &amp; FY 17 are shown in DM6IN Installation P40-A. All cost from FY 18 and follows will be captured in this P3-A exhibit.</proc:Remarks>

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Machinery Control System (MCS) replaces the obsolete control consoles while also delivering enhanced capability to the fleet through improved situational awareness and reconfigurable user stations.  The new consoles use COTS-based computers which connect via Versa Modular Eurocard (VME)-chassis technology.  The VME architecture is expected to be supportable for the remaining service life of the ship and will enable computer upgrades within the chassis thereby mitigating future obsolescence concerns.

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>The Integrated Bridge &amp; Navigation System (IBNS) replaces obsolete bridge consoles and introduces flexibility with how the pilot house is managed during navigation. The key benefit is the ability for operating with fewer watch-standers,  reduced watch standard workloads, and improved safety of navigation.

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Description>

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.

[VLS EQUIPMENT] Engineering services increase in FY 18 due to increased number of Combat System availabilities in FY 20.</proc:Description>

Engineering Services:

Production Support Services are phased over a three (3) year span starting two (2) years prior to installation on a per hull basis.  It includes five (5) elements that are related to the production and delivery of a usable end-item:  Production Engineering, Quality Assurance, Product Improvement, Acceptance Test and Evaluation, and Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS). Due to the phasing of the requirement over a three year period, engineering services will fluctuate depending on the number of ships in each year.

Five (5) elements and approximate breakdown is as follows:

Production Engineering includes preparation, test and technical evaluation of engineering changes to correct deficiencies in the production items; production configuration control; review and evaluation of production design data and documentation; and logistic supportability efforts.

Quality Assurance includes the preparation of procedures and the conduct of inspections, examinations and test during production that are necessary to deliver an item of the required quality as specified by the terms of the contract.

Product Improvement includes improving reliability/maintainability/availability, and the correction of deficiencies exclusive of contractual specifications.

Acceptance Test and Evaluation of a production item includes preparation of test plans, testing, data analysis, and data evaluation.

Contractor Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) includes the furnishing of advice, instruction, and training by commercial or industrial companies.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Department decided that a number of survivability improvements needed to be incorporated into mission-essential ship and combat systems during their acquisition and modernization. Shipboard fires have emphasized the urgent need to upgrade features and design standards that contribute to survivability.

[P40A / HB003 - EMERGENCY ESCAPE BREATHING DEVICE (EEBD)]: Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD) breathing apparatus for firefighters are reaching their service life of 15 years and must be replaced.  EEBDs address a high priority CNO effort to replace expired breathing equipment aboard ships throughout the Fleet.  The requirement for this capability has been validated by the experience of numerous shipboard casualties.  EEBD replacement is required to ensure that ships will deploy with operational safety equipment on-board to allow for emergency escape from shipboard fires.

[P40A / HB830 - PRODUCTION ENGINEERING (PE)]: PE includes development of technical manuals, Planned Maintenance System (PMS), Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD), Program Support Data (PSD) and Allowance Parts List (APLs); engineering to manage procurement and material; support of design reviews.

[P3A / HB002 - MAGAZINE SPRINKLING IMPROVEMENT]: Replaces the detection system designed in the 1960s which has performance deficiencies and is difficult to support and maintain.  Replacement includes the Fire Detection and Actuation System (FDAS) and the Motor-Operated Pilot Valves (MOPV).  When the FDAS detects a fire, the MOPV opens to provide the sprinkling for the magazine.  The FDAS consists of heat detectors, smoke detectors for amphibious ships, and associated controls.  MOPV is the same item procured under HB007 - SOPV Replacement.  FDAS/MOPV provides increased fire performance and reduced unit and logistics costs.

[P3A - 2 / HB007 - SOPV REPLACEMENT]: The Solenoid Operated Pilot Valve (SOPV) provides a way for remote control of the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and Countermeasure Wash Down (CMWD) systems.  Existing SOPVs are unreliable, costly to repair, and produce the longest downtime for the AFFF system.  Top Management Attention/Top Management Initiative (TMA/TMI) and INSURV interest due to impact of this item on AFFF system operation.  Replacement of the SOPV with the Motor Operated Pilot Valve (MOPV) is required to ensure these systems are operational for emergencies.  MOPV has a 50 year service life and will provide a significant reduction in preventative maintenance and cost.

[P3A - 3 / HB008 - SCBA REPLACEMENT]: Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is a compressed air breathing device compatible with a firefighter's protective wear and helmet, and other damage control equipment.  The SCBA are reaching the end of their service life of 15 years and are being replaced with 30 year cylinders.  SCBA replacement is required to ensure that ships will deploy with operational safety equipment on-board to provide breathable air while fighting shipboard fires.

[P3A - 4 / HB009 - FIREFIGHTER ACCESS]: Funds the Firefighter Extraction System (FES) and Ladder Safety System (LSS) installations.  FES provides rescue lifting capability to remove injured or exhausted firefighters from the bottom of escape trunks.  LSS provides firefighters fall protection while using escape trunks for vertical entry firefighting.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The switchboard program provides mission critical switching capability required to link shipboard combat equipment including weapons, launchers, sensors, computers and navigation equipment. In essence, switchboards serve as
the central connection point for most elements of combat and weapon systems, interior communications, data transfer, and command and control systems. They are designed to accommodate either analog, digital interfaces, or a
combination of both. In total, this budget item supports approximately 200 ships and 1,000 pieces of equipment throughout the acquisition life cycle.

Functions include: data routing; action cutout; test and operating mode selection (including casualty back-up modes); power monitoring and control; circuit protection; peripheral equipment isolation; and signal processing,
frequency conversion amplification and switching. In summary, the primary purpose is to provide systems intra and interface compatibility.

Changes in other elements of the combat and Interior Communication (IC) systems will frequently mandate either conjunctive modification to switchboards via ship change documents (SCDs), ordnance alteration (ORDALT)/
field changes (FCs) or partial or complete replacement of existing switchboards. Typical switchboard mods include hardware/field change kits, ORDALT/SCD/FC instructions, technical manual updates and revisions to other
supporting documentation. Hull unique switchboard configurations require hull unique documentation. Subsequent alterations to these switchboards require hull unique design, hardware, installation, and checkout procedures.
New Switchboards are normally installed during a regular overhaul by a shipyard.

Command and control switchboards are currently installed on and are required for almost all surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships. Individual switchboard unit cost varies from ship to ship, depending upon size,
complexity, and whether analog or digital interfaces or some combination thereof are utilized. Modifications to existing switchboards via Ship Alterations (SHIPALTs), SCDs, ORDALTs or FCs are quantified by kits or change
packages rather than individual units. The number of kits required for different classes of ships are as follows: DDGs/CGs require three to four (3 - 4) per ship, LSDs require two (2) per ship, LPDs require one (1) per ship, MCMs
require (3) per ship and LHDs require two (2) per ship. The magnitude of modifications also varies, as Cruiser Modernization is considerably more complex than the Amphibious Class hulls. Switchboard hardware is normally
procured by the Invitation For Bids (IFB) process, from manufacturers on Qualified Products List (QPL)-17000. There are currently six companies listed on QPL-17000. All contracts awarded are competitive, fixed price.

[P40A / GE003 ENG UPGRADES/MODS TO EQUIPMENT &amp; TECH DOCUMENTATION]: Combat Systems &amp; Interior Communication Switchboard Engineering and Modifications Upgrades to Equipment, Drawings, Technical Manuals (TMs) Allowance Parts Lists (APLs) and Allowance Equipage Lists (AELs).  This line covers the costs to upgrade/modify existing equipment and associated technical documentation to implement and validate upgraded switching configurations essential for the ships' switchboards to properly integrate all elements of the Combat System and Interior Communication interfaces.  The upgraded engineering modification drives the procurement of hardware modification kits (i.e., ORDALTs &amp; Field Changes).  These engineering modifications are essential to the functional deployment of Battle Force Interoperability.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This budget provides funding for targeted modernization of various HM&amp;E systems on board Amphibious Assault Ships.  Modernization efforts include the procurement and installation of: High Efficiency Small-Capacity (HES-C) Air Conditioning Compressors; various Interior Communications (IC) systems; automated Electric Plant controls and circuit breakers as part of the Power Management Platform (PMP); Brushless Generators for the PMP; main feed pump replacement; steam fire pump replacement; Shipboard Air Traffic Control Communications (SATCC); and Navigation Critical Data System (NCDS/NavCrit).

 HES-C provides additional air conditioning capability to support growing electronic cooling requirements. IC Systems modernization provides up to date IC system installations necessary to maintain critical communications internal to the ships.  Electric Plant controls and circuit breaker installation provides modern electric plant controls as part of the overall PMP to improve survivability and increase electric plant reliability. Brushless Generator replacement will reduce down time, total ownership costs, and maintenance costs associated with antiquated brush type generators. Main feed pump procurement and install replaces obsolete main feed pumps for the main propulsion boiler.  Steam driven fire pumps are replaced with variable speed drive (VSD) electric fire pumps eliminating a substantial maintenance driver for the LHA/LHD Class Ships. Additionally, funding supports procurement and installation of SATCC and Navigation Critical Data Distribution (NavCrit) systems in support of capability requirements on Amphibious Assault Ships.

                    <proc:Remarks>Power Management Platform (PMP) modernization converts legacy controls to a digital automated control system.  This system gathers and combines all Electric plant data so that it is available at any electric plant control station.  PMP simplifies multiple step control sequences into single step operations and makes possible control capabilities that were previously too cumbersome for operators to perform. i.e. Baseload, and Real / Reactive power balancing. PMP implements a gradual Ship Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) turbine startup/shutdown sequence which allows the turbine to achieve stabilized temperatures more consistently, reducing stress on components and contributing to prolonged service life.  System automation reduces electrical system transients and stress on breaker components by employing a Zero Power Transfer (ZPT) strategy, which limits the current flow through an individual breaker to zero during open/close evolutions.  
Switchboard Breaker Upgrade and Power Management Platform (Electric Plant Controls) must be installed concurrently.  Collectively, these two non-severable modernization efforts provide enhanced electric plant (EP) situational awareness, reliability flexibility, and survivability through replacement of obsolete breakers with breakers currently used in other ship classes and through installation of modern electric plant controls and alarms.  Brushless Generator Install must be accomplished prior to or concurrent with Switchboard Breaker Upgrade and Power Management Platform (Electric Plant Controls).</proc:Remarks>

Legacy circuit breakers currently utilized on LHD-1 class ships are obsolete, problematic and have a high cost of ownership.  These breakers will be replaced with a unit that is also installed across multiple classes of surface ships. The replacement circuit breakers have a high reliability and low cost of ownership. All generator output, load center and bus tie breakers will be replaced as a part of this modernization.

            <proc:Description>FY 2018 funding request reflect a reduction of $3.171 million to account for the availability of prior year funds.

POLLUTION CONTROL SYSTEMS/EQUIPMENT:  This item provides funds for the procurement of pollution control systems and equipment that are required by Navy ships in order for them to comply with international regulations, federal laws, DOD Directives and Navy environmental protection regulations.  These regulations, laws and directives restrict the discharge of oily waste, sewage, solid waste, plastic waste, medical waste and hazardous waste.  Most of these applicable regulations require Navy ships to comply by fixed deadlines.  Failure to comply carries potential personal, civil, and criminal liability, and significantly imposes constraints on the operational capabilities of Navy ships.  In some instances, the compliance schedule has required an acceleration of the normal schedules in the procurement process.

SHORE BASED POLLUTION EQUIPMENT - (Logistics)
The shore based funds provide for equipment required to clean up Navy oil spills on the open sea as required by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act - Public Law 92-500.  The law created a National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan, and designates the Department of Defense as one of the primary agencies responsible for promotion of effective operation of the plan.  The Supervisor of Salvage is assigned the responsibility to provide technical expertise, resources, and equipment for cleaning Navy-originated spills of oil and other hazardous material in coastal waters or the open sea.  Major items of procurement are:

[P40A / HF040 FIELD SUPPORT SYSTEMS]: These systems provide the auxiliary support required to keep Navy oil spill responders operating in the field without significant lapse of response time in all Navy Areas of Responsibility (AoR) according to Federal Law 33 CFR 155 and 154 and implemented by OPNAV5090.1D. As such, many Navy areas of operation are in remote and austere parts of the world with little to no operational support available, therefore the inventory objectives of equipment procured under this cost code are set to support emergency personnel in responding to the Navy's worst case oil or hazardous substance (OHS) discharge scenario in all AoR's and to be pre-positioned in the Emergency Ship Salvage Material (ESSM) Bases world-wide. Systems include Boom Handling Boats, Boom Tending Boats, Personnel Transfer Boats, Field Command &amp; Control Centers, Field Conference Centers, Field Rigging Lockers, Field Repair Workshops, Personnel Berthing Modules, Field-grade Satellite Communications Systems, and Oil Spill Aerial Surveillance Systems. Unit cost varies greatly between systems.

[P40A / HF051 OIL BOOM SYSTEMS]: These systems consist of inflatable or foam-filled oil booms of various sizes (18 inch, 26 inch, 42 inch).  Inventory is based on the Federal requirements for Oil Spill Response Organizations (OSROs). Boom systems range in unit cost based on size (18 inch, 26 inch, 42 inch) and type (inflatable or non-inflatable). These systems include all associated equipment required to store, inflate, deploy, recover, and repair the boom, including lighting systems to mark the boom in navigable waterways. All inflatable boom systems also include shoreline transition booms to seal across beach areas. These systems are packaged in 8 foot x 8 foot x 20 foot standard shipping containers.

[P40A / HF055 SALVAGE SUPPORT SYSTEMS]: These systems are a collection of small, special-purpose oil skimmers, containment booms, shoreline transition booms, transfer pumps, temporary oil storage, sorbents, and ancillary equipment intended as a stand-alone response package for small, salvage-related spills inside and adjacent to ships in distress or inland (river and lake) spills.  These systems are packaged in an 8 foot x 8 foot x 20 foot standard shipping container.

[P40A / HF056 EQUIPMENT CLEAN-UP SYSTEMS]: These systems provide a full array of tools and materials required to perform the extensive decontamination needed for oil spill and hazardous chemical response equipment and personnel during an operation and prior to demobilization once a spill has been contained and recovered.

[P40A / HF057 OIL HANDLING SYSTEMS]: Oil handling systems provide the capability to recover and dispose of oil and debris during emergency oil spill response operations including temporary oil storage as required by 33 CFR 155 and 154. Equipment missions additionally include moving heavy oil or oil in cold conditions that exceed the capability of conventional skimmer systems and providing means of transferring oil from skimmers to temporary oil storage.  Systems include Vacuum Pump Systems, Oil Bladder Transfer Systems, Annular Water Injection Systems, At-Sea Bladder Pumping Systems, and Temporary Oil Storage Systems (Bladders, Tanks, etc.)These different systems can range greatly in individual unit cost.

[P40A / HF062 LIGHTERING SYSTEMS]: These systems are specially designed for lightering oil from aboard ships in distress whose transfer systems are inoperative or inaccessible or for extracting oil from sunken vessels where drilling and pumping through the hull of the vessel is often necessary at depths up to 20,000 feet. Various pump sizes and types as well as extraction tools are packaged together in fly-away systems meant to pump oil product in almost any emergency scenario. These systems are packaged in 8 foot x 8 foot x 20 foot standard shipping containers.

[P40A / HF063 VESSEL OF OPPORTUNITY SKIMMER SYSTEMS]: The Vessel of Opportunity Skimmer Systems are oil skimmers designed and packaged to be deployed aboard any vessel that is available during an emergency oil spill response operation with enough deck space to support the operating equipment.  These systems allow for mechanical recovery of oil on the water in situations where traditional skimmers may not be practical, such as far offshore or in inclement weather or high currents. These systems include all the ancillary support equipment required to maintain oil spill recovery operations onboard a vessel for an extended period of time. These systems are packaged in an 8 foot x 8 foot x 20 foot standard shipping container with an 8 foot x 8 foot x 8 foot support container.

[P40A / HF067 VESSEL SKIMMER SYSTEMS]: These systems are self-propelled skimmers designed for near-shore and low sea-state open ocean environments and are used in conjunction with oil containment boom for mechanical recovery of oil on the water. They are designed to be rapidly transportable to the scene of an oil spill.

[P40A / HF031 POLLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT FIELD CHANGES]: HF031 - POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT FIELD CHANGES - Funds field changes for reliability and maintainability improvements and corrections of conventional pollution control equipment systems.  

Oil Pollution Abatement (OPA) Systems Improvements: Existing OPA systems have demonstrated poor operational availability, maintainability, and reliability. This comprehensive effort addresses the entire OPA system, from holding tanks to overboard discharge, leveraging recommended improvements new to the Fleet and approved, partially completed alterations. The alterations needed to correct design deficiencies are ship specific and require ship checks to confirm the current configuration as prior alterations may have completed one or several of the recommended improvements. The alterations may include, but are not limited to: installation of new tank level sensors; upgrades to the Oily Water Separator (OWS) and the Oil Content Monitor (OCM), correction of OWS suction problems, correction of OCM inlet &amp; outlet piping including related of flush water piping configuration problems, and upgrade of oily waste transfer pump relief valve. Extensive work will occur with LHD-1 Class upgrades to convert the existing OWS to the VS-50 OWS and DDG-51 through DDG-88 ships will receive the Oily Waste Membrane System to produce an effluent that meets the 15 ppm maximum oil discharge requirement.

[P40A / HF830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING]: HF830 PRODUCTION ENGINEERING:  Air conditioning plant kit and software quality control, technical manual and complete conversion instruction revisions, technical reports based on investigative efforts of OEM quality assurance or obsolescence issues, and support equipment removal from inactive ships or other Navy assets.

[P3A / HF024 CFC-114 (R-114) AC CONVERSION]: HF024 - CFC CONVERSION PROGRAM The production of chlorofluorocarbon(CFC)-based refrigerants (including CFC-12 and CFC R-114) was prohibited after 31 DEC 95 by the Clean Air Act of 1990. Presidential Executive Order 13693 calls for federal agencies to " promote sustainable acquisition and procurement by ensuring that each of the following environmental performance and sustainability factors are included ... alternatives to ozone-depleting substances".  The Navy is currently dependent on CFC-based refrigerants for the mission-critical cooling of (1) vital electronics and weapon systems, (2) food and medical stowage, and (3) inhabited spaces aboard surface ships and submarines. To counter the immediate threat of production cessation on uninterrupted Fleet operations, DoD directed the Defense Logistics Agency to establish a stockpile of CFC-based refrigerants. The stockpile was sized to support Fleet operations until the last CFC-based systems are retired or converted to ozone-friendly refrigerants. This program procures and installs conversion kits on existing CFC R-114 Air-Conditioning (A/C) plants onboard surface ships. The CFC R-114 conversion program began in FY 99 and is expected to complete FY2021. The inventory objective for CFC R-114 is 402 converted units.

            <proc:Description>The Submarine Support Equipment budget provides for equipment technical refresh and upgrades that consist of hardware, software, system engineering, integrated logistics support, system test and evaluation, training, data, installation assistance teams and program management.  This funding also procures equipment and material used to implement the military high priority Submarine Silencing Program for operating nuclear submarines.  This equipment technical refreshes and upgrades are not supported by other NAVSEA program offices and support SSN/SSBN/SSGN Class submarines and land based laboratories/facilities.

The installation funds are provided for the Ship Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) Governors on SSN688 and SSN21 Class submarines, acoustic range array replacement, Ship Control System Processors for Seawolf Class submarines, and SSN Class Component Upgrades.

[P40A / Fwd Automatic Bus Transfer Pwr Mod]: PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - Forward Automatic Bus Transfer (ABT) Power Modification - The in-service VA ships in Block I/II have received the Hotel Services SHIPALT which included Static ABTs and power transformers to support increased forward electronics processing capability for continuing SWFTS sonar/fire control tech insertions.  At-sea operations have since identified problems with loss of electronics processing in conjunction with a loss of power to a forward electrical bus.  A new construction change for blocks III/IV platforms is in progress, but a backfit SHIPALT for a power distribution upgrade on blocks I/II must be developed and fielded on SSN 774-783.  Material lead time is estimated to be less than 12 months.

[P40A / MRO Shock Mod SA 4629K]: PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - Manual Remote Operator (MRO) Shock Modification (SHIPALT 4620K) -  Accomplishes design changes on 20 MROs per ship to meet shock qualification requirement. The MROs are for valves AHP-33, TD-138, DSW-1, DSW-2, TD-128, TD-65, TD-129, SDA-8I, PL-2, SDA-82, TD-127, TD-49, SDA-53, SDA-54, SDA-41, TD-125, PL-81, EAFW-244, EAFW-245 and EAFW-67.  Backfit installation of the SHIPALT is planned for SSN 774-781 (782 - 783 received at PSA).

[P40A / Circuit Cathodic Protection Sys OER]: PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - CKT D / Cathodic Protection System Obsolete Equipment Replacement (OER):  Circuit D supports degaussing operations.  The current design on block I/II ships is 1990's COTS and is obsolete, requiring tech refresh to block III design via a backfit SHIPALT design and fielding.  Additionally, future upgrade of the VA Class SWFTS sonar/fire control systems to TI-16/APB-15 or greater involve a change of middleware from CORBA to AMPQ, requiring CKT D to also transition to AMPQ.  This transition requires a CKT D redesign and upgrade by SHIPALT.   The cathodic protection system on VA Class blocks I/II ships uses an Impressed Current Cathodic Protection electronics that is COTS-based.  Due to continued obsolescence with in-service ships, a complete system redesign is planned in new construction block V that would require backfit on in-service ships to allow the ICCP system to continue providing hull structure corrosion protection and maintain interfaces with other systems like CKT D.  The redesign effort for the two systems will result in separate SHIPALTS but are related due to system interfaces.  Block I/II platforms (SSN 774-783) require upgrade.  Change applicability to Block III platforms is under review.

[P40A / SSTG Reliability Upgrades]: PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - Ships Service Turbine Generator (SSTG) Reliability Upgrades - Recent failures on in-service VA Class submarines of the SSTG bearing system design have identified the need for both short term and longer term corrective design actions.  SHIPALT design development is required for several system improvements including modifications to the Bearing Thrust Housing Chamfer to increase air flow and reduce temperatures,  the Bearing Thrust Moisture Sensor to seal sensor internals from moisture and reduce introduction of moisture to the thrust housing, and installation of a Flow Diverter to seal existing gaps between gland seals on the turbine and the forward end of the thrust bearing.  Longer term corrective action for block I/II ships (SSN 774-783) involves redesign and possible replacement of bearing system, depending on results of ongoing failure analysis.  Impact to Block III platforms is to be determined.

[P40A / VA Class Acoustic Superiority Prog 							Acoustic Superior]: PB002 SSN Component Upgrades - VA Class Acoustic Superiority - Design Development - Funding will be utilized to execute requirements included in "PEO SUBMARINES ASW CAMPAIGN PLAN UPDATE, 9073 Ser 450W4K/S0116 of 2 Mar 2016".  This letter (SECRET) provides details on the plan to backfit new design AS treatment on 5 BLK III submarines during their first EDSRA, with follow-on installs on 6 BLK IV submarines during their EDSRAs.  In addition, design work for backfit SHIPALT development for selected machinery improvements is included.  AS treatment installations will be based on design and material developed for installation on USS SOUTH DAKOTA (SSN 790) as part of the South Dakota Improvement Program (SDIP) during PSA.  Beginning in FY18, funding is provided for development of SHIPALT products for backfit installation of the AS treatment by Naval Shipyards on VA Class hulls, as well as for SHIPALT development for backfit of AS-related machinery improvements by EDSRA Shipyards or Fleet IMAs.  Funding is also provided for design and beginning in FY20 for fabrication of staging enclosures for use by the EDSRA shipyards and for handling and application equipment required for AS treatment installations.  Engineering services are also funded to provide processes and procedures to the EDSRA shipyards for handling, setup and operation of staging enclosures and for the treatment handling and application equipment.

                    <proc:Remarks>PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - Propulsor Upgrade SHIPALT 4548K - Current propulsor design on VA class in-service ships exhibits excessive corrosion problems.  A SHIPALT has been developed to accomplish modifications to the propulsor, shaft, bearing snubber, forward outer structure cover plate, rotor tailcone, rope guard, fastener system, and associated local cathodic protection system, to achieve a 156 month corrosion protection system for the propulsor without interim repairs or replacement.  Backfit installation was initially started by the VA Class program office and has transitioned to PMS392 to procure the remaining three ships of the five shipsets and install the remaining five shipsets.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>PB002 SSN Class Component Upgrades - Integrated Communications System (ICS) -  The interior Integrated Communication System installation on VA Class ships Block I/II hulls is a COTS based system designed in the mid-1990s and first installed in 2002.  Much of the design is now obsolete and unsupported.  The ICS must be operational to meet underway requirements.  Back-fitting the Block I/II platforms with the updated Block III system avoids a complete redesign, but there are parts of the updated Block III design that are projected to become obsolete in the future.  The block III design is currently being evaluated for possible additional updates to processor cards, graphics cards, Asynchronous Transfer Mode switches, Linear Displacement Transducers, Absolute Pressure Transducers and touchscreen displays to resolve near term projected obsolescence, with development of a backfit SHIPALT in FY17 for fielding in FY 18 -FY22 on eight ships by PMS392.  This effort began in line item 0942 and transitioned to 0941 in FY18 where the remaining seven shipsets will be procured and eight shipsets will be installed.</proc:Remarks>

            <proc:Description>The VIRGINIA Class BLI 0942 provides a wide range of material required to operate, test, support and maintain the viability of VIRGINIA SSN-774 Class Submarines.  The "Major Shore Spares" component includes rotatable pool and insurance spares.  Propulsor rotatable pool assets support planned maintenance during scheduled availabilities by decreasing equipment turn-around time/availability duration. Rotatable pool program equipment includes the high pressure air compressor, various pump/motor assemblies, radar mast, ventilation fans and thin line towed array components and other components.  There is a significant increase in the profile of this component from FY18 through FY20 in support of additional high speed machining capabilities at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC) in Philadelphia.  This is the VIRGINIA Program Office portion of the propulsor foundry equipment as agreed to by PEO SUB, VIRGINIA Program Office, and ORP Program Office.

This funding line also includes upgrading the afloat acoustic system required to conduct TECHEVAL/OPEVAL satisfactorily, efficiently and with minimal risk of equipment failure. Conduct hardware and software development, procurement, maintenance, and operations as required to achieve and maintain submarine acoustic signatures trials program. The resultant capabilities support the Submarine Acoustic Trials Enterprise, which includes the VIRGINIA Class submarine test and evaluation program. Also included in the Vertical Launch System (VLS) Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) are primarily All-Up Round Simulators (AURS)/All-Up Round (AUR) Ballast Cans necessary to conduct TECHEVAL/OPEVAL and provide ballast for ship operation.

The wireless LAN provides a ship wide (forward of the reactor compartment) intranet (Non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (Unclassified Enclave) (NIPRNET)) that significantly enhances the quality of the work by facilitating electronic correspondence, personnel data management, collaborative services, interactive whiteboard, multi-user chat and access to these sites: Fleet Training Management &amp; Planning System/Navy Training Management &amp; Planning System (FTMPS/NTMPS), Composite Health Care System (CHCS), prescriptions, MYPAY-Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Navy Personnel Command (NPC), Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS), email, Fleet Technical Support Center, Atlantic (FTSCLANT), Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning and Procurement (SUBMEPP) and Navy Knowledge Online (NKO).

Maintenance Planning System funds will be used to help ship programs identify, plan and execute maintenance activities as well as improve efficiently at all levels (performed by ship's force as well as organizational/depot level) by creating a set of tools to provide a robust, disconnected and comprehensive training and maintenance solution delivering dynamic content. This set of tools and the associated ship-to-shore data environment will reduce O&amp;MN funding over time. This will be fielded as part of the Non-Tactical Data Processing System (NTDPS) to VIRGINIA Class submarines.

Additionally, the continuous ship upgrades necessary to maintain class viability of the earlier ships are included in this funding line. This is particularly important for Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Technology Refreshment and Technology Upgrades for Non-Propulsion Electronic Systems (NPES). The class level of modernization and capability rests on available resources.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: VA Class Submarines
Type Modification: Various

Provide procurement of materials necessary to modernize VIRGINIA Class Submarine Blocks I &amp; II (774-783) infrastructure (i.e. power, cabling, cooling, and arrangements of the ship for the entire Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/ Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) NPES configuration).  This combination of Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) alterations to VIRGINIA Class submarines is collectively referred to as the "Hotel Services" modification.  This Hotel Service modification is necessary to accommodate modernization to major combat system alterations (i.e. A-RCI, AN/BYG-1, and ISIS) and are completed concurrently with those major combat system alterations.  TI-02 baseline systems Hotel Services modernizations are completed during Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) for SSN777 and SSN779-783 and during EDSRA or TYCOM Operational Availability (TOA) for SSN774-SSN776 and SSN778.  Block III and follow ships do not require this significant HM&amp;E infrastructure upgrade as the baseline design for those ships accounts for the necessary power, cabling, cooling, etc. required to host upgrades to major combat systems.

Hotel Services modernization kit procurement for SSN778 takes place in FY16 and is installed during FY17 EDSRA.  Kit procurement for SSN774 takes place in FY18 and is installed during FY19 DMP.     

Note: Actual costs associated with the HSWG installation on SSN 775 during EDSRA (FY12-13) have necessitated the Department to increase planned installation budget on current and future installations (Budgeted: FY17-778 and Planned FY19-774).</proc:Remarks>

Materials are as large as rotors and as small as anodes and fasteners.  Quantity is variable and would skew any attempt to determine a unit cost. VIRGINIA Class rotatable pool rotors are removed, refurbished, and placed into a pool. There is no set installation schedule as rotors, once available, are installed on subsequent availabilities. 

There is a significant increase in the profile of this component from FY18 through FY20 in support of additional high speed machining capabilities at the Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC) in Philadelphia.  Investment will provide for the procurement and construction of large high speed milling machines with 28-foot table diameters that are required for semi-finish through finish machining and assembly of COLUMBIA and VIRGINIA components including rotors, stators, and ducts.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This funding procures long-lead major end items required for repairs to both variants of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The items procured mitigate major long-lead replacement times due to unplanned system failures and casualties and increases availability of vital Fleet assets by reducing repair part procurement and delivery times. Funding procures support equipment, required ancillary equipment, and associated engineering and technical support services for LCS.

LN001 - LCS Battle Spares
This line procures shore-based battle spares, ensuring their availability in the event of a failure or major casualty to key systems. Systems that require shore-based spares include gas turbines, diesel engines and generators, propulsion systems, reduction gears, auxiliary propulsion units (APUs), and machinery plant control &amp; monitoring systems (MPCMSs). Inventory objectives are determined by the LCS Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) Plan, NAVSEA RMA guidance, the critical application of equipment, and vendor data. 

LN002 - LCS Water Jet Spares
Both LCS variants are propelled by water jets; this line procures spare water jets and water jet components.  There are two LCS designs, the FREEDOM variant and the INDEPENDENCE variant, each using four water jets. The FREEDOM variant uses Rolls-Royce water jets and the INDEPENDENCE variant uses Wartsila Lips water jets.  The water jet assemblies are mounted externally on the ships' transom.
These items will be designated 2S cog material and support a rotable pool for life cycle sustainment. In the event of a casualty, the water jets are removed and sent to a depot to be repaired. 

LN003 - Engineering Services
This funding provides engineering and technical support for LCS Class Support Equipment.  Services include the establishment of Technical Data Packages (TDPs) and the creation of associated depot level repair parts lists/installation requirements. Funding is also provided for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Design Services Allocation (DSA) modernization efforts tied to the ship availabilities.  

LN004 - Habitability Modification
In FY16, the budget funded Habitability Modifications (berthing racks and potable water) to increase permanent berthing to 98 for FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE variants for LCS 5 thru LCS 8.  
FY17 budget funds berthing spaces, refrigeration (chill and freeze), dry provision stores, potable water, solid waste storage, and laundry.

LN005 - LCS Ships Class Safety Design Changes
Safety modifications include the redesigned stern ramp for the FREEDOM variant ships to support 11M Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) operations and the installation of bridge wing for safe and effective operation on the INDEPENDENCE variant ships.
In FY18, the budget for the LCS Ships Class Safety Design Changes was realigned to LI 1604, LCS In-Service Modernization.

LN006 - LCS Ships Class Ancillary Equipment
This funding procures the connective equipment necessary to ensure fit and function of procured LCS Class Support Equipment when installed.

LN007 - AFSB SOF MODs
This funding procures the 3-D Air Search Radar to modify the Mobile Landing Platform-Afloat Forward Staging Base (MLP-AFSB) (Expeditionary Mobile Base, ESB) to support Special Operations Forces (SOF) requirements.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Procurement of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries and Shipalt installation to modify submarines from use of legacy flooded battery (no longer in production at former sole source manufacturer) to new design VRLA battery.  Initial installations of VRLA battery also requires the installation of an Automatic Battery Monitoring system (ABMS).  The budget procures and installs initial and replacement VRLA batteries for SSN688 Class, SSN21 Class, SSGN726 Class,  SSBN726 Class, and SSN774 Class Submarines.  Batteries have a finite life and are consumables; therefore, the budget procures life-cycle replacement VRLA batteries at a notional 5 year replacement cycle.  Procurements with Automated Battery Monitoring System (ABMS) are new installations, and procurements without ABMS are life-cycle replacements.

[P40A / HM002 - LOS ANGELES Class Main Storage Battery]: HM002 procures replacement low maintenance sealed lead acid batteries for LOS ANGELES Class submarines, which involves adapting commercial VRLA technology to submarines.  This replaces flooded battery technology for which the industrial base ceased manufacture and support of in FY05.  Installation unit costs vary due to the availability types, location of installation and submarine type.

[P40A / HM008 - OHIO Class Main Storage Battery]: HM008 procures replacement low maintenance sealed lead acid batteries for OHIO Class submarines, which involves adapting commercial VRLA technology to submarines.  This replaces flooded battery technology for which the industrial base ceased manufacture and support of in FY05.  Installation unit costs vary due to the availability types, location of installation and submarine type.

[P40A / HM009 - SEAWOLF Class Main Storage Battery]: HM009 procures replacement low maintenance sealed lead acid batteries for SEAWOLF Class submarines, which involves adapting commercial VRLA technology to submarines.  This replaces flooded battery technology for which the industrial base ceased manufacture and support of in FY05.  Installation unit costs vary due to the availability types, location of installation and submarine type.

[P40A / HM010 - VIRGINIA Class Main Storage Battery]: HM010 procures replacement low maintenance sealed lead acid batteries for VIRGINIA Class submarines, which involves adapting commercial VRLA technology to submarines.  This replaces flooded battery technology for which the industrial base ceased manufacture and support of in FY05.  Installation unit costs vary due to the availability types, location of installation and submarine type.

[P40A / HM830 - Production Engineering]: Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane, as the designated procurement activity and In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) monitors battery performance and establishes replacement schedules with the fleet.  NSWC Crane is also tasked with leading a Government &amp; Industry Root Cause Analysis (RCA) team to identify and address causes for premature capacity decline seen with VLRA batteries.  NSWC Crane conducts qualification testing of VRLA cells which, in addition to being a Performance Specification requirement, has proven very beneficial to the Navy in detecting battery deficiencies that can be corrected before installation, thus alleviating critical emergent fleet impact.  Funding is provided for Puget Sound and Portsmouth Naval Shipyards responsibilities for the flooded battery inventory storage, maintenance and inventory management, SHIPALT support, and AIT management. In addition, costs for Planning Yard SHIPALT completion and Lead Yard Services are funded through this line.</proc:Description>

The results of the Shipboard Wide Area Network (SWAN) / Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) study directed the replacement of the C4I capability of the LPD 17 Class SWAN with CANES and the conversion of the non-C4I SWAN into a new HM&amp;E Network (mini SWAN).   SWAN funding is required to field the new HM&amp;E Network in support of the CANES  installation.  In addition, funding is required to sustain the legacy SWAN, while the LPD 17 Class ships await the CANES/HM&amp;E Network back fit installation.   SWAN serves as the backbone of the LPD 17 class and funding is necessary to address obsolescence, reliability issues, performance concerns, emergent Fleet requirements including enabling Cryptologic Log On (CLO), eradicating Windows XP, replacing aging obsolete network hardware (e.g., servers and core switches), and maintaining the Information Assurance posture of the Common Operating Environment (COE).   This funding is vital to ensure the LPD 17 Class ships can combat the evolving cyber threat.</proc:Description>

Shipsets of equipment vary in quantities and types of components each fiscal year and within a fiscal year. Each ship requires a different number of alterations to be installed, and these alteration packages vary in scope and cost based on individual ship configurations. A quantity of &quot;1&quot; represents a single &quot;kit&quot; intended for installation in one ship, in a single Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Availability. Ships may be receiving more than 1 kit in a single availability based upon the fielding plan for the systems being modernized.  FY 16 Procurements were contracted to support the LPD 18 Dry-Docking Select Restricted Availability beginning in Jan 2017.

Each ship requires a different number of alterations to be installed, and these alteration packages vary in scope and cost based on individual ship configurations.  Due to Type Commander (TYCOM) Integrated Class Maintenance Plan(ICMP) scheduling adjustments, CNO availabilities for LPD 17 Class have increased from once every 2 years to once every 3 years.

                    <proc:Description>[SWAN-CANES Integration] The results of the Shipboard Wide Area Network (SWAN) / Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) study directed the replacement of the C4I capability of the LPD 17 Class SWAN with CANES and the conversion of the non-C4I SWAN into a new HM&amp;E Network (mini SWAN).   SWAN funding is required to field the new HM&amp;E Network in support of the CANES  installation.  In addition, funding is required to sustain the legacy SWAN, while the LPD 17 Class ships await the CANES/HM&amp;E Network back fit installation.   SWAN serves as the backbone of the LPD 17 class and funding is necessary to address obsolescence, reliability issues, performance concerns, emergent Fleet requirements including enabling Cryptologic Log On (CLO), eradicating Windows XP, replacing aging obsolete network hardware (e.g., servers and core switches), and maintaining the Information Assurance posture of the Common Operating Environment (COE).   This funding is vital to ensure the LPD 17 Class ships can combat the evolving cyber threat.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>DDG 1000, a multi-mission surface combatant, will serve as a versatile asset in the context of future Naval Strategy.  Armed with an array of weapons, DDG 1000 will provide the Joint Force Commander with precision strike and volume fires.  Designed with sustainable payload, multi-spectral stealth and optimal manning, DDG 1000 will take the fight to the enemy with unprecedented striking power.

Program provides for DDG 1000 combat system hardware/equipment suite technology refresh to support obsolescence management and address reliability, maintainability &amp; availability (RM&amp;A) issues following fielding. Combat
System hardware will be approaching 10 years of age at time of delivery for DDG 1000 and 1001. Active management of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) obsolescence via hardware/equipment technology refresh will be required
to ensure DDG 1000 class ships reach their design service life. Additionally, program will sustain and upgrade in-service DDG 1000 ships in order to achieve their Expected Service Life (ESL). Upgrades will be mission capable in
countering current and projected threats, improve operational capabilities, and comply with requirements.

[P40A / DDG 1000 Data Center]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of critical technology refresh of the technical baseline for the first DDG 1000 data center (2 per ship) to enable the DDG 1000 combat system to operate with two (2) fully populated data centers (computer rooms). Technology refresh includes identification and qualification of applicable obsolete DDG 1000 data center parts, technical drawing updates (Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) &amp; cabinet level), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) updates (LRU &amp; cabinet level). Two (2) fully populated data centers on DDG 1000 enable shipboard integrated training, support Overall Combat System Operability Test (OCSOT) implementation, support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, and provide system redundancy in the event of operational casualty.  Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems. DDG 1000 data centers house the Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE); a single, secure network that includes all shipboard computing applications, from Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4), and intelligence equipment to Combat Management Systems (CMSs) to machinery control and embedded training, support, and damage control systems.

[P40A / DDG 1001 Data Center]: Funding provides for the procurement and installation of critical technology refresh of the technical baseline for the first DDG 1001 data center (2 per ship) to enable the DDG 1000 combat system to operate with two (2) fully populated data centers (computer rooms). Technology refresh includes identification and qualification of applicable obsolete DDG 1000 data center parts, technical drawing updates (Lowest Replaceable Unit (LRU) &amp; cabinet level), and Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) updates (LRU &amp; cabinet level). Two (2) fully populated data centers on DDG 1000 enable shipboard integrated training, support Overall Combat System Operability Test (OCSOT) implementation, support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, and provide system redundancy in the event of operational casualty.  Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems.

[P40A / DDG 1000 Class Product Improvement]: Funding will support ship alteration (Shipalt) prioritization and planning through shipyard installations during availabilities.  Other modernization efforts include but are not limited to logistics and technical documentation, engineering services and Alteration Installation Team (AITs) within the Fleet Modernization Program (FMP).  FY2017 funding will procure DDG 1000 Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) network switches which are critical items required to support DDG 1000 Data Center technology refresh.  These TSCE network switches support Integrated Ship Plan (ISP) validation, address obsolescence, and require configuration engineering prior to installation. Without a supportable ISP, the ship will be unable to validate the operation and safety of the ship's systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Funding in this P-1 line provides for the procurement of tactical Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) equipment that will be installed aboard ships and in the facilities at the TRIDENT Refit Facility (TRIREFFAC), Navy Intermediate Maintenance Facility (NAVIMFAC) and TRIDENT Training Facility (TRITRAFAC).  The TRIDENT Refit Facility and Navy Intermediate Maintenance Facility (NAVIMFAC) are dedicated shore support facilities providing a full range of industrial support.  The TRITRAFAC provides the crews for the OHIO Class (SSBN/SSGN) Submarines with realistic training experience in operating and maintaining shipboard equipment.

[P40A / HH009 EQUIPMENT HM&amp;E &amp; SWS/SS ALTERATION]: This provides for the replacement of obsolete equipment on board of OHIO Class Submarines and at dedicated Shore Support Facilities (TLCSF, TRITRAFAC (B), NAVIMFAC (B), TRITRAFAC (KB), TRIREFFAC (KB), Major Shore Spares (MSS)).  These alterations are necessary in order to replace obsolete/outdated equipment with new equipment to maintain or increase mission capabilities, replace or modify components/systems which have proven to be unreliable, correct design and safety problems and reduce fleet maintenance burdens.  Funds provide for multiple efforts to ensure that the OHIO Class Ship Control Subsystem, both hardware and software components, support the extended life of the OHIO Class submarine platforms.  In FY99 and again in FY06 a NUWC KEYPORT study identified a number of obsolete electronic components in the Ship Control Station (27 out of 107) that are no longer available. The FY06 study recommended that the Ship Control ISEA develop and execute a program that would address the near term obsolescence issues and ensure the continued availability of the subsystem in the out years.  Alterations and actions are done at the lowest practicable and authorized level (taking into consideration urgency, priority, capability, capacity and cost).  Alterations to OHIO Class Submarines are scheduled for accomplishment at the TRIREFFAC, Kings Bay, NAVIMFAC, Bangor, and at Naval Shipyards during Depot Availabilities.  This requires equipment procurement and installation, technical planning, training, and associated resources.  This line provides for material procurement necessary to install the required alterations to OHIO Class Submarines. 
                                                                                                               Additionally, this line provides for the utilization of specially trained and dedicated installation teams to ensure accelerated and correct installation of complex and high priority alterations within specific time frames.  Provided are comprehensive program management and execution, including planning, direction, control, installation, integration, and coordination of specifically selected safety related, mission enhancement or technical HM&amp;E alterations. Starting in FY12, SSBN Strategic Weapon Support Systems (SWSS) OER Upgrades are planned for Ventilation Alarm Monitoring Panel (VAMP) and the Missile Heating and Cooling Proportional Controllers.   Both upgrades are required to support Strategic Systems Programs' Strategic Weapon Systems (SWS) Integration program (Mod6/Mod7) which replaces the current Launcher, Fire Control and Weapons Support electronics.  Starting in FY16, two SSBN/GN OER transducer upgrade programs are planned, one for Hovering Transducers and the second for MDD/MHC Differential Pressure Transducers.  Both transducer types are estimated to be out of spares by 2018 and will require form/fit/function replacement.  The Hovering System on both SSBNs and SSGNs is experiencing obsolescence issues due to aging technology and terminated vendor component production as of 2000.  The Missile Drying and Dehumidification (MDD) system and Missile Heating and Cooling (MHC) system on both SSBNs and SSGNs provides a stable temperature and humidity environment for the missile tubes, and has similar obsolescence issues, with terminated vendor component production as of 2009.

[P40A / HH012 EQUIPMENT HM&amp;E TRIDENT ENGINGEERING AVAILABILITY]: TRIDENT Engineered Availability (EA) material support funding is required to provide replacement and contingency material to support the critical path schedule during the SSBN 726 Class Submarine Engineered Availabilities (EAs) commencing in FY93 and continuing through the operational life of the submarine.  Funding is also required to formulate or procure complex tools and fixtures required to reduce EA scheduled durations.  This program also provides funding for installation of Depot level alterations packages, Quality Assurance (QA) oversight and certification by Supervisor Of Shipbuilding, Groton (SOS Groton) of OPN SHIPALTS performed by Electric Boat Corporation (EB), Liaison Action Requests and Selected Record Drawings (LAR/SRD) mark ups for Shipalt related work, NUWC Newport test support and deck plate coordination of Alteration Installation Team (AIT) work during both Engineered Refueling Overhauls (ERO) and Extended Refit Periods (ERPs)/ modernization periods.

[P40A / HH0GN SSGN MODIFICATIONS]: Provides for procurement of SSGN unique system components that will be installed during planned modernization periods.  Also provides funding to perform integrated testing of these unique systems to ensure satisfactory operation with other HM&amp;E and Combat Systems.  Beginning in FY11, funds are provided for procurement of Submarine Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique system components that will be installed during planned modernization periods.

[P40A / SOF HH0GN]: Additionally beginning in FY11, funds are provided for installation of Submarine Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique system components.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY2018 increase due to FY2017 funding being rephased for prior years under execution. FY2017 funds provide the bare minimum for sustainment of existing fleet capabilities. FY2018 funding is required to complete initial outfitting of Transfer Under Pressure (TUP) spares and planned upgrades to Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS).  

The Submarine Escape and Rescue Program, formerly Deep Submergence Systems Program (DSSP), is responsible for the procurement, life cycle support, and improvement and modernization of assigned platforms and programs.  The Submarine Escape and Rescue Program provides for the procurement of equipment to support the establishment and maintenance of fleet capability for a number of programs which perform submarine search and rescue, inspection, and object location and retrieval from the ocean environment.  Submarine Escape and Rescue procurements replace obsolete, non-supportable equipment and subsystems through phased improvement and modernization projects.  These projects may include special ship alterations, field change kits, and design corrections.

SOURCES:  The sources for these acquisitions are limited.  There are few private companies actively engaged in deep ocean engineering and even fewer with the specialized experience, knowledge, and facilities to meet the exacting requirement of the Submarine Escape and Rescue Program.  Accordingly, sole source contracts are sometimes required; however, where possible, contracting via open competition is utilized.

REFERENCES:
Acquisition Plans 584-87 Revision 7 approved August 2000.  Acquisition plan for Submarine Escape and Rescue is reviewed twice annually by the Submarine Escape and Rescue Review Group (SERRG).

[P40A / HJ030 - RESCUE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: INTERVENTION SYSTEMS (ATMOSPHERIC DIVING SYSTEM (ADS)/ROV/ SRDRS/SUBMARINE RESCUE CHAMBER (SRC) Intervention assets (ADS/ROV) are required to support the SRDRS and SRC world-wide rescue capability mission.  Intervention assets are used to clear disabled submarines seating surfaces, attach the SRC downhaul cable, attach salvage fittings, deliver emergency life support stores, and assess disabled submarines.  The ADS is a modified COTS one-man, one atmosphere diving system.  An initiative is in process to transition from the ADS manned system to an unmanned ROV to reduce operational risk; full transition is pending availability of funding for second ROV.  SRC provides shallow water rescue capability.  SRDRS is the deep water rescue vehicle and will be delivered in increments.  The Submarine Rescue System-Rescue Capable System (SRS-RCS) completed OPEVAL in FY08 and is currently the deep water rescue ready vehicle for the U.S. Navy.  The final component of SRDRS is TUP or Submarine Rescue System-Submarine Decompression System (SRS-SDS).  Full Operational Capability (FOC) has been delayed due to efforts associated with Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM) restoration to service; Initial Operating Capability (IOC) planned for March 2018.
SURVIVABILITY This equipment will provide a more efficient CO2 removal capability giving the fleet an increase in survival time from 3 days to 7 days for a disabled submarine and adds state of the art atmospheric monitoring equipment aboard each submarine.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Modernized Ticonderoga Class cruisers are multi-mission, large surface combatants which will operate as the Air Defense Commander platform for Carrier Strike Groups, as units of Surface Action Groups, in support of Marine Amphibious Task Forces, or independently in multi-threat environments that include air, surface and subsurface threats.  These ships respond to Low Intensity Conflict, Coastal and Littoral Offshore Warfare, and joint mission scenarios as well as open ocean conflict, providing and augmenting power projection and forward presence.  These ships conduct Air, Surface and Undersea Dominance, Land Attack, and Force Protection missions.   The Ticonderoga Class is currently executing the CG Modernization (Mod) Program which upgrades combat systems; command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems; and hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&amp;E) systems to achieve desired service life and pace the multi-mission threats.  The CG Mod program  provides the following combat systems upgrades: AEGIS Weapon System with the most current computer program and equipment suite; SPQ-9B air search radar; 5-inch, 62-caliber digital guns, integrated MK 34 Gun Weapons System with most current computer program and equipment suite; SQQ-89A(V)15 SONAR suite with multi-function towed array; integrated Mk 41 Vertical Launch System with most current computer program and equipment suite. C4I upgrades include: CANES, Navy Multiband Terminal, ADNS, NAVSSI, DMR, SSEE, and BFTN along with required peripherals.  HM&amp;E upgrades include All Electric to eliminate the auxiliary steam system, Integrated Ship Controls, structural changes to enable embarkation of the MH-60R helicopter, and aluminum superstructure alterations. 

Current FY18 budget procures one shipset of these systems for USS HUE CITY(CG 66) as well as supports continues installations, engineering support services, and programmatic support for USS COWPENS (CG 63), USS GETTYSBURG (CG 64), USS CHOSIN (CG 65), USS VICKSBURG (CG 69), USS CAPE ST GEORGE (CG 71), and USS ANZIO (CG 68).  Starting in FY15, the Ships Modernization Operations and Sustainment Fund (SMOSF) was used to support modernization requirements for USS COWPENS (CG 63), USS GETTYSBURG (CG 64), USS CHOSIN (CG 65), and USS VICKSBURG (CG 69).   Congress rescinded SMOSF in the FY17 Defense Appropriations Act, therefore the Navy submitted a budget proposal to fully fund the CG Mod program as part of the President's Budget for FY18.

Initial DSA costs were funded by SMOSF and funded the SSRA in FY16 for CG63 USS Cowpens.  Funding for FY18 - FY22 is shifting funds from PB17 submit to 2-4-6 CG Modernization. Installation was executed incrementally: a portion of the work was accomplished in prior SSRAs and completed during the EDSRA.  In/Outs are reflecting the EDSRA since that is when the ship is being reactivated following the EDSRA.">1.1.1) CC011 - ISC EQUIPMENT - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>The LCAC (Landing Craft Air Cushion) mission is to transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo, and personnel of the assault elements for the Marine Air/Ground Task Force from ship-to-shore and across the beach. The LCAC rides on a cushion of air contained in a flexible skirt and is propelled by two aft-mounted, reversible, variable pitch propellers. It is capable of speeds in excess of 40 knots. The LCAC sustainment funding is programmed for equipment procurement using OPN to replace selected engines, personnel transport modules and other equipment that the fleet urgently requires to maintain acceptable levels of readiness.

LC001 - LCAC SYSTEM UPGRADES
The LCAC System Upgrade Program provides for selected modernization through procurement and installation of components required to maintain acceptable levels of fleet operational readiness. Equipment removal and installation will take place at the two Assault Craft Units (ACUs), each of which are currently responsible for half of the craft inventory. 

LC002 - ENGINES
The ETF-40B engines are enhanced versions of the current TF-40B engines and are being provided with the rest of the SLEP craft. Recent catastrophic engine failures have highlighted the need for spare engines to reduce operational downtime. Engine procurements are also for Pack Up Kits (PUKs) that accompany fleet deployment of LCACs aboard amphibious ships. Additional ETF 40B Engines will be needed for this purpose since they are being newly introduced as part of SLEP.

LC007 - LIGHTWEIGHT ARMOR
The portable lightweight armor system replaces the existing armor system. The portable system can be transported via a Container Express (CONEX) box and provides the Assault Craft Unit with the ability to provide ballistic/fragmentation protection to manned spaces on the craft as well as to selected machinery components.

LC008 - COLD WEATHER KITS
LCACs are required to operate in ambient temperatures as low as 10F. Snow and ice accumulation leads to actuation of a safety system that bypasses the main engine inlet air filtration system and allows engines to draw in unfiltered air. Cold weather kits prevent snow and ice accumulation in the main engines during cold weather operations.

LC009 - PERSONNEL TRANSPORT MODULE
The Personnel Transport Module (PTM) increases the capability of the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) to transport personnel and protect occupants from the elements inherent in an amphibious environment.

LC010 - SSC FULL MISSION TRAINERS (FMT)
Ship to Shore Connector (SSC) Full Mission Trainer (FMT) is a programmable simulator and is a fundamental element of SSC operator training.  New SSC FMTs are required because LCAC FMTs will not support SSC crew training based on significant Command Module/C4N System differences.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Underwater Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) program supplies EOD and Maritime Expeditionary forces with the necessary allowance outfitting, and diving and diving-related equipment aligned to fulfill assigned missions that includes Expeditionary Mine Countermeasures (ExMCM), other Maritime Expeditionary missions, and Marine Mammal Systems (MMS) operations. Most equipment must have inherently low acoustic and magnetic signatures to support maritime operations in the vicinity of influence fired ordnance.  This funding supports outfitting the Navy's only comprehensive expeditionary mine countermeasures (ExMCM) capability in the fleet that can conduct full spectrum detect-to-engage expeditionary MCM missions. Specifically, the Underwater Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) program supports EOD Groups, Units, and Detachments worldwide. 

The establishment of ExMCM Forces under the direction of Commander, US Fleet Forces Command has resulted in an increased inventory requirement for Underwater EOD systems and equipment, with a resultant requirement for re-aligned procurement and fielding priorities. The nature of the missions assigned to EOD and MCM forces under OPNAVINST 3501.97H, Required Operational Capabilities &amp; Projected Operational Environments (ROC/POE), require an aggregated set of systems and equipment to perform the wide range of mine countermeasures, underwater detection, location, investigation, force protection, and neutralization tasks that comprise the mission set. The requirements for the procurement of each of these system suites are articulated in OPNAV approved requirements documents in accordance with DoD Directive 5000.2, SECNAVINST 5000.2E, and the JCIDS process as defined by CJSCINST 3170.01.

Naval Special Warfare (NSW) - FY 2018 initiates a service-common systems program for Naval Special Warfare's (NSW) Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs). Naval Special Warfare currently employs UUVs as an intelligence collection platform, building situational awareness of the Undersea Domain, and prior to conducting clandestine operations in support of the highest strategic objectives. UUVs are critical to NSW's undersea component, mission planning for anti-access and area denial (A2AD) environments, and the current fight against violent extremist organizations.  The use of open architecture, untethered platforms not only buys down risk to mission and force, but also provides the operational commander a diversified menu of employment options.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 funding is required to procure Underwater EOD program systems and equipment to outfit Expeditionary MCM Companies, EOD and Mobile Salvage units with hardware required to accomplish their OPNAV approved Required Operational Capability and Projected Operational Environments. This equipment will allow warfighters to detect, locate, investigate, neutralize and render safe unexploded ordnance including improvised explosive devices. The ExMCM capabilities being delivered under this program directly support the surge MCM capacity and capability outlined in the FY17 US Navy Mine Countermeasure report submitted to Congress under provisions of the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that will provide a more agile and cost effective warfighting capability through a modular and adaptive MCM force approach.

Additionally, FY2018 funding is required to procure product improvements needed for systems designed and first produced over 40 years ago, as well as the production engineering and integrated logistics support needed for all Expeditionary MCM Companies, EOD Units, and Expeditionary Salvage units. These systems provide the only expeditionary mine interdiction capability in the US Navy.  If these forces are not properly outfitted lives may be lost, access to sea lanes of communication could be severed, and risk to transiting forces will be elevated.   Specifically, upgrade kits to MK 18 Family of Systems will be procured to provide increased MCM capability;  MK 19 upgrade kits will be procured to provide EOD Response ROV capability for mine/unexploded ordinance (UXO) target prosecution; improved diver sensor tools will be procured to provide enhanced target detection and localization capabilities; and auxiliary equipment procured that is required to fully outfit systems to perform their intended missions.

OCO: 
$3.4M of FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) will procure for two Mk 18 Mod 2 systems, critical equipment needed to outfit deploying NECC forces in support of ongoing USN operations in CENTCOM. Four MK 18 vehicles have been continuously deployed in theater for the last four years to support a critical capability in the Counter Mine mission. These operational prototype systems were developed, procured, and fielded in response to urgent operational needs.  To date, they have over 5000 operating hours and due to the extremely high OPTEMPO, these prototypes vehicles have experienced extensive wear and tear. As a result, these systems now require complete restoration and equipment replacement to return them to full operational status. 

$4.9M of FY 2018 OCO funding for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) will support the replacement of the Mk 18 Mod 1 unmanned undersea vehicle variant that US Navy SEALs currently employ as an intelligence collection platform  prior to conducting clandestine operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and other missions. These systems are critical to NSW's undersea component, mission planning for anti-access and area denial (A2AD) environments, and the current fight against violent extremist organizations.

$4.0M of FY 2018 European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) OCO funding will procure ExMCM equipment to provide significant improvements to Expeditionary MCM capability in the US SIXTH FLEET AoR.  This budget supports projects under the President's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) to reassure allies of the U.S. commitment to their security and territorial integrity as members of the NATO Alliance, provide near-term flexibility and responsiveness to the evolving concerns of our allies and partners in Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe, and help increase the capability and readiness of U.S. allies and partners.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget provides for "S" cognizance (Shipboard, Hull, Mechanical &amp; Electrical (HM&amp;E) equipment for surface ships and aircraft carriers) which are not in any specific category. This equipment accomplishes program alterations for installation during CNO and Fleet availabilities, fills Fleet requisitions from casualties and attrition, provide tech refresh upgrades, and replaces obsolete equipment. Primary objectives are to maintain or improve readiness, safety, reliability, reduce workload, lower maintenance costs, improve sailor quality of life, and/or sustain ship classes through their notional life or beyond.  The budget purchases install various equipment including machinery pumps, generators, ships propellers and shafts, air compressors, davits, A/C Plants, and steam propulsion items. It also procures allowance items as required by the Coordinated Shipboard Allowance List
(COSAL).  Major programs are the CVN Class Machinery Plant Upgrades, MACHALTs, Carrier Auto Voltage Regulator (AVR), Solid State Lighting, Patrol Coastal Modernization, and Expeditionary Mobile Base (ESB).

[P40A / LT060 - MACHALTs]: The Machinery Alteration (MACHALT)  Program supports identification, procurement, and installation of Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) equipment and system improvements on in-service ships.  The components are required to support units in the Fleet during the Continuous Maintenance Availability (CMAV) and other windows of opportunity.  Due to Fleet usage requirements, and alignment of availability periods in a given year, adjustments are made to quantities and items throughout the FYDP.  Program execution improves system readiness and reduces life cycle cost.  MACHALTs are installed via the Navy Modernization Process (NMP) in the following priority order:  (1) Mandatory Safety, (2) Statutory, (3) Safety, and (4) Troubled Systems/Obsolescence Alts.

[P40A / LT110 - Propellers and Shafts]: LT110- VARIOUS PROPELLERS AND SHAFTSThis funding procures spare waterborne shafting (propeller shafts and stern tube shafts) and controllable pitch propeller (CPP) system end items such as propeller blades, hubs and oil distribution (OD) boxes used on DDG 51 class ships.  These spares are required to meet DDG 51 class Fleet demand due to scheduled replacement caused by lifecycle wear and unscheduled replacements caused by CASREPs.  The component has long repair turn-around times (1-2 years) and thus cannot be repaired and reused during the same availability.  The technical requirements and drydocking constraints drives the program to establish a rotatable pool to support replacements.  The growing size of the DDG 51 class is driving the requirement to increase the number of spares to support a rotatable pool and ensure readiness.  A malfunctioning propeller or shaft may result in excessive vibration, which could lead to damage of ship structures and equipment (bearings, main reduction gears, and bulkhead seal), increase of ship cavitation/noise, loss of speed or loss of motion.  

LT110 Item 3, Procurement cost for FY17 cost elements 3.1-3.3 reflect vendor cost increases based on prior year procurements.

[P40A / LT120 - Carrier Propulsion Plant Inspection]: Funds will be utilized to procure the latest technology inspection system tooling, i.e., laser-optic, ultrasonic, fiber-optic, electro-optic and computed radiography inspection systems.

[P40A / LT130 - Steam Propulsion Items]: LT130 - STEAM PROPULSION ITEMS										
This provides for several initiatives oriented to upgrading boiler efficiency and safety with downstream maintenance effectiveness. In particular, the items procured include: Upgraded Stack Gas Analyzer (SGA) , Optimization Trim Loop Material including fuel oil meters, stack gas temperature sensors, electronic automatic boiler controls interface software/schema to improve steam plant efficiency, Upgraded electronic automatic boiler control (E-ABC) system process controllers/smart transmitters, Upgraded Boiler Water/Feedwater (BW/FW) Chemistry Analysis/Carbohydrazide Implementation Equipment.,  Upgraded SSTG Protective Devices (Overspeed Trips), and Upgrades to Boiler Igniter System (BIS) (Fuel Valve and Insert/Retract Air Actuators).  The Steam Propulsion Improvement Program provides safe and reliable power for ship movement through the water, and, in addition, provides power to ships combat and habitability systems, whether electrical or steam dependent. At any given time, due to propulsion plant casualties, ship propulsion systems may be operating at reduced capability, adversely affecting the ship's mission(s). The Steam Propulsion improvement program encompasses steam and diesel propulsion surface ships in the Fleet, and provides for material upgrades to propulsion systems resulting in increased readiness, safety and reliability. Items can be installed during a scheduled or unscheduled availability by a shipyard, tender/Intermediate Maintenance Activity or Alteration Installation Team (AIT).

[P40A / LT830 - Carrier Production Engineering]: The review and approval of any production contract technical documentation, or the separate development of this documentation, to include: Technical Manuals, Planned Maintenance System (PMS), Level III Production Drawings, Provisioning Technical Documentation (PTD), Program Support Data (PSD), and Allowance Parts List (APL); engineering support for final design reviews.

[P40A / LT325 - Propulsion Shafting]: Establishes a holistic shafting program that provides program management and life cycle support for Carrier propulsion shafting.  Purchases the two intermediate shaft segments to complete the CVN rotatable pool of shafting.  Purchases the couplings required to make the shaft segments ready for install.  Several CVNs had docking periods extended because the time required to overhaul existing shafts did not meet project milestones.  To rectify the issue, the Department stood up a partial pool of "ready for issue" CVN shafts using existing carcasses and refurbished removals from decommissioned ships.  Using existing funds to overhaul existing carcasses, a pool of over 12 segments was built.  Funding required for 2 additional segments that are required to meet Shipyard requirements.  No carcasses exist to meet this need; therefore these two shaft segments will be purchased new along with ancillary material (couplings) required for installation.

[P40A / LT326 - Training Test Equipment]: Through the Technical Training Audit Program (TTAP) it has been found that the vast majority of lifecycle Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) courses of instruction do not teach to current Fleet configurations, have obsolete or non-existent training equipment and do not utilize current training technology where appropriate. Funding required to replace outmoded and obsolete Training Test Equipment in established Navy schools, as identified in approved or draft Navy Training System Plans (NTSPs).

[P40A / LT328 - Mobile Cleaning Recovery and Recycle System (MCRRS)]: The Mobile Cleaning, Recovery &amp; Recycling System (MCRRS) is a shipboard heavy duty, self-powered and propelled cleaning vehicle which utilizes pressurized water jet technology, water reclaiming and recycling systems onboard the unit to clean and restore non-skid surfaces on Navy aircraft capable ships.  MCRRS will replace the existing obsolete Tennant flight deck scrubber, significantly reduce manpower allocation and materials required to conduct the manual cleaning process utilizing soap and water, and be fielded on all LHA and LHD platforms.  Funding will procure units, spares, training, and engineering services support.

[P40A / Prior Year Funding]: Prior years funding for all cost elements no longer funded.

[P40AMOD / LT306 - Automated Voltage Regulator (AVR)]: LT306 - AUTOMATED VOLTAGE REGULATOR
The CVN Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is a microprocessor based voltage regulator system for the NIMITZ Class, programmed to replace the legacy analog voltage regulator, which, although operational, lacks the improved reliability and lower maintenance costs of the AVR.  It controls the output voltage of a turbine generator (TG), which converts steam into the electricity used for aircraft and combat operations, and reactor cooling.

[P40AMOD / LT307 - Carrier Canned Lube Oil Pump]: The Canned Lube Oil Pump (CLOP) with a two-speed motor will replace both the Standby Lube Oil Pump (SLOP) and Emergency Lube Oil Pump (ELOP) on all CVN-68 Class ships. The ships have repeatedly overhauled SLOPs to replace turbine and reduction gear parts as well as replacing leaking mechanical seals at excessive costs. The ELOPs are also regularly overhauled to replace leaking mechanical seals. In addition, the installed ELOP does not meet all operational requirements for a Lube Oil System. The motor and pump are an integral piece on the CLOP which alleviates any alignment issues and a mechanical seal is no longer required.

[P40AMOD / LT308 - LHD/LHA Davits]: LT308 - LHD/LHA Davit
Funding provides for the procurement of Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) Davits for LHA and LHD Class Ships.  These allow ships to utilize Navy Standard 11M RIBs which replace antiquated Landing Craft Personnel (LCPL) boats which are no longer supported and present a maintenance burden, reduction in operational availability and jeopardize ships' ability to perform Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) missions.

[P40AMOD / LT309 - Solid-State Lighting (SSL)]: LT309- SOLID-STATE LIGHTING (SSL) FIXTURES 
Solid State Lighting refers to a type of lighting that uses semiconductor Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), or Polymer Light-Emitting Diodes (PLEDs) as sources of illumination rather than electrical filaments, plasma (used in arc lamps such as fluorescent lamps) or gas. Funds provide for replacement of fluorescent and incandescent lighting fixtures installed on Amphibious Class ships with a Solid-State Lighting (SSL) fixtures.

[P40AMOD / LT314 - Carrier Oil Water Separator]: A new Oil Water Separator (OWS) system will be installed on the CVN 68 Class to meet the new environmental discharge law of 15 parts per million (ppm) worldwide. System will include OWS, Oil content monitor and bilge and stripping system. The current OWSs installed on CVN 68 Class experience a high degree of costly maintenance and reliability issues and they do not meet the 15 ppm requirement.

[P40AMOD / LT316 - Patrol Coastal ECDIS]: LT316 - PATROL COASTAL MODERNIZATION	
The PC Sustainment Program provides necessary modifications and upgrades to keep PC 1 class ships in-service and supportable through their expected service lives (until 2025). Upgrades include Navigation upgrades, Electronic Chart Display and Information System-Navy (ECDIS-N) upgrades, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) upgrades. FY16 increase due to the Navigator of the Navy direction, that all ships must be paperless by the end of FY16.

[P40AMOD / FMP Ship Units - LSD Davit]: LT322 - LSD Davit
Provide Davit capabilities to meet the new OPNAV LSD boat requirement for two 11M Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs).  Previous requirement was one 7M RHIB and one 11M RHIB.  New Davit provides RHIB Launching Capability that meets Mandatory Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS), Force Protection and Mission Requirements (Amphibious Assault; Anti-Piracy; Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS)).

[P40AMOD / LT327 - Modular Refrigeration System.]: Modular Refrigeration System (MRS) replaces the existing legacy ship's stores refrigeration system (SSRS) onboard CVN68 class carriers. The legacy system is energy inefficient, space inefficient, and maintenance intensive, requiring highly skilled personnel to operate and maintain acceptable box temperatures. Most hardware associated with the legacy systems is specialized mil-spec and is either becoming unsupportable due to obsolescence, or is grossly expensive to maintain. Each MRS is comprised of a Modular Refrigeration Unit (MRU), an operating/diagnostic control panel, and small chilled water cooled flat-plate condenser. There are 15 MRUs required per hull. MRS's are self-contained hatchable MRUs with a dedicated control panel that eliminate 90% of current maintenance requirements and require minimal operator support/training.

[P3A / LT160 - Machinery Plant Upgrades]: LT160 - MACHINERY PLANT UPGRADES (INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS AND ADVANCED NETWORK (ICAN)				
ICAN provides core infrastructure (node rooms, air blown fiber optic cable plant, network services) for integrating voice, video and data systems.  This capability is easily upgradeable for rapid and cost effective expansion to support new technologies, such as IT-21, and is compatible with the Navy's integrated Information Networks MOA.

[P3A - 10 / LT318 -  Carriers  Passive Countermeasures System (PCMS)]: classified effort

[P3A - 12 / LT321 ESB SOF Backfit]: Funds provided for ESB 3 and 4 Special Operation Forces (SOF) components. Efforts include ship changes necessary to add radio infrastructure and increase bandwidth capacity, make ESB compatible with night vision devices, and to add additional aircraft operating spots. Other efforts include ship changes and services for additional Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) capacity, increased medical services (shock/triage/forward resuscitative surgery system), and increased capacity for storage/fueling capability of MOGAS.</proc:Description>

The CVN Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is a microprocessor based voltage regulator system for the NIMITZ Class, programmed to replace the legacy analog voltage regulator, which, although operational, lacks the improved reliability and lower maintenance costs of the AVR.  It controls the output voltage of a turbine generator (TG), which converts steam into the electricity used for aircraft and combat operations, and reactor cooling.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: Carrier Canned Lube Oil Pump

The Canned Lube Oil Pump (CLOP) with a two-speed motor will replace both the Standby Lube Oil Pump (SLOP) and Emergency Lube Oil Pump (ELOP) on all CVN-68 Class ships. The ships have repeatedly overhauled SLOPs to replace turbine and reduction gear parts as well as replacing leaking mechanical seals at excessive costs. The ELOPs are also regularly overhauled to replace leaking mechanical seals. In addition, the installed ELOP does not meet all operational requirements for Lube Oil System. The motor and pump are an integral piece on the CLOP which alleviates any alignment issues and a mechanical seal is no longer required.</proc:Remarks>

A new Oil Water Separator (OWS) system will be installed on the CVN 68 Class to meet the new environmental discharge law of 15 parts per million (ppm) worldwide. System will include OWS, Oil content monitor and bilge and stripping system. The current OWSs installed on CVN 68 Class experience a high degree of costly maintenance and reliability issues and they do not meet the 15 ppm requirement.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Modular Refrigeration System (MRS) replaces the existing legacy ship's stores refrigeration system (SSRS) onboard CVN68 class carriers. The legacy system is energy inefficient, space inefficient, and maintenance intensive, requiring highly skilled personnel to operate and maintain acceptable box temperatures. Most hardware associated with the legacy systems is specialized mil-spec and is either becoming unsupportable due to obsolescence, or is grossly expensive to maintain. Each Modular Refrigeration System (MRS) is comprised of a Modular Refrigeration Unit (MRU), an operating/diagnostic control panel, and small chilled water cooled flat-plate condenser. There are 15 MRUs required per hull. Modular Refrigeration Systems (MRS's) are self-contained hatchable modular refrigeration units (MRU) with a dedicated control panel that eliminate 90% of current maintenance requirements and require minimal operator support/training.</proc:Remarks>

The Machinery Plant Upgrade project within the CVN Fleet Modernization Program (FMP) encompasses CVN Machinery Control Systems, Ship Control (Navigation/Steering), Integrated Voice Control Networks, Announcing Systems and Shipboard Air Traffic Control Communication Systems.  The machinery plant upgrade modernization alterations currently consist of greater than 40 different Ship Change Documents (SCD) with a cost value of approximately $42M for all the alterations combined.  Individual SCDs can range in cost from $5K (for software only changes) to ~ $14M for major system upgrade procurements. The range of SCD installs can cost as low as $100k and as high as $4 million for individual SCDs.  During each CNO availability, we schedule and complete a subset of these 40+ alterations.  Each hull is different receiving varying subsets of the 40+ SCDs depending on individual ship configurations. These alts are scheduled for installation over 3-4 availabilities (which may be 9-12 years) with many installations occurring in later years of the FYDP. Additionally, the machinery plant upgrade program is technology driven and many alterations are still being finalized in the Navy modernization Program (i.e. Ship Change Document (SCD) development) process for installation in later years. New SCDs continue to be developed to proactively address obsolescence issues associated with ever changing technology. The current budget for the out years is based on initial SCD development estimates.">1.1.1) Machinery Plant Upgrades - NonOrganic</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>CHEMICAL &amp; BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE PROGRAM (INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS):
Public Law 103-160, Section 1703 created a Joint Service Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) to address ever growing threats from the aggressive proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Joint CBDP funds the development and procurement of Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) Equipment to enhance the warfighter's ability to survive and complete their mission in a chemical biological contaminated environment. The Navy is responsible for the associated installation/integration and sustainment funds only. The Navy's requirement for Joint Biological Point Detection System (JBPDS), Improved Point Detection System/Lifecycle Replacement (IPDS/LR), Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS), Next Generation Chemical Detection (NGDS) System, and Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) system has been validated by CNO in associated Joint Operational Requirements Documents.

Installation of Equipment
Funding is for installation of equipment including Fleet Modernization Program installations, installation of training equipment and installation of equipment in other shore facilities. Procurement of equipment is funded by the Joint
Service CBDP.

Detector installation costs can vary significantly, even within ship class,  depending  on installation location (East coast, West coast, OCONUS, etc.), if installation accomplished pier side or in a ship yard (i.e. availability type during which installation actually occurs), ship as built and as found conditions,  and installation growth work (i.e. unplanned/unexpected work) driven by as found conditions.

[P3A / CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM IPDS/LR]: - FY16 installations include four (4) MCM Class ship at $193.4K each, one (1) LSD 41 Class ship at $203.4K, three (3)CG-47 Class ships at $205K each, two (2) DDG-51 Class ships at $189.4K each, and one (1) LCC-19 Class ship at $205.9K. Total installation costs for IPDS-LR in FY16 is $2,177K for eleven (11) ships. FY16 DSA cost is $672K.


- FY17 installations include three (3) MCM Class ship at $180.3K each, three (3) LHD-1 Class ship at $196.5K each, one (1) LPD-17 Class ship at $158.4K, two (2) LSD-49 Class ships at $185.4K each, one (1) CG-47 Class ships at $205K each, one (1) DDG-51 Class ship at $190K, and one (1) CVN-68 Class ship at $182K. Total installation costs for IPDS-LR in FY17 is $2,237K for twelve (12) ships.  FY17 DSA cost is $552K.

 - FY18 installations include two (2) LCS Class ships at $219.4K each, two (2) LSD-41 Class ships at $206.5K each, three (3) CG-47 Class ships at $215.8K each, and four (4) DDG-51 Class ships at $187.7K each. Total installation cost for IPDS-LR in FY18 is $2,250K for eleven (11) ships.  FY18 DSA cost is $406K.


- FY19 installations include three (3) LSD-49 Class ships at $200.5K each and two (2) CG-47 Class ships at $194.9K each.  FY19 DSA cost is $312.7K.

- FY20 installations include two (2) CG-47 Class ships at $203.4K and one (1) LSD-49 Class ship at $198.2K.

[P3A / IPDS/LR]: The IPDS/LR (formerly SEACADS/IPDS) will improve the existing shipboard point detection system for detecting and identifying chemical nerve and blister agent contamination presence. Inventory objective for shipboard installations is 123.

[P3A - 2 / CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM JBAIDS]: JBAIDS plan - 
- FY16 installations include one (1) LHA-6 Class ship at $89.1K and one (1)CVN-68 Class ship at $89.1K. Total installation costs for JBAIDS in FY16 is $178.2K for two (2) ships.

[P3A - 2 / JBAIDS]: The JBAIDS will provide U.S. operating forces with a biological organism identification and diagnostic device that will identify and quantify biological organisms of operational concern and other pathogens of clinical significance for confirmatory and prognostic purposes. Inventory objective for shipboard JBAIDS installations is 23 and Refrigeration installations is 17.

[P3A - 3 / CW001 CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM JBAIDS REFRIGERATION UPGRADE]: JBAIDS Hardware Upgrade plan - 
- FY17 installation includes one (1) CVN-68 Class ship at $84.3K.

[P3A - 6 / NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)]: The Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) is a technology replacement for the IPDS and IPDS-LR systems. The program consists of four variants for multiple applications; the Navy will be installating variant 1 for fixed chemical agent detection capability. The inventory objective for shipboard installations is 185.

[P3A - 7 / ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)]: The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) system is a lifecycle replacement kit for existing JBPDS installations. Intended as a retrofit kit which will be installed using the Joint Service CBDP budget, there are seven (7) ships that will not receive the JBPDS system prior to EMBD entering the fleet, and will thus require full EMBD kits (EMBD retrofit kit + shell) with installation funded through this budget. LCS-2 and LCS-4 had JBPDS partially installed during new ship construction by the shipyard and will require installation of the EMBD retrofit kit and re-installation of the system properly to make the systems functional.  The inventory objective for shipboard installations is 9.</proc:Description>

This work can be accomplished by NSWC PHILA as the in-service engineering agent, other Naval activities or contractors as appropriate.

[P3A / CAMS IIA]: 5D009 - CENTRAL ATMOSPHERE MONITORING SYSTEM (CAMS) IIA
A replacement atmosphere analyzer to replace the current CAMS I units on 688 Class submarines due to obsolescence.

[P3A - 2 / LOW PRESSURE ELECTROLYZER]: 5D010 - THE LOW PRESSURE ELECTROLYZER (LPE) The LPE will replace the Electrolytic Oxygen Generators (EOG) currently being used on SSBN/SSGN Class submarines.  The LPE has replaced the Oxygen Generating Plant (OGP) on SSN 21 Class submarines.  The LPE produces oxygen at low pressure eliminating the need for high pressure oxygen storage.  There will be two LPEs on each SSBN/SSGN Class submarine and one LPE on each SSN 21 Class submarine.  LPEs originally planned for the SSN 688 Class submarines have been reallocated to be installed on SSBN submarines.  LPE on SSBN is critical for the class to support its strategic deterrence mission.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>FY 2018 funding request reflects a reduction of $1.984 million to account for the availability of prior year funds.

The Operating Forces IPE Budget has been restructured to identify and break out individual component costs previously consolidated within Item Numbers in previous Budget submits.

The Operating Forces IPE budget provides funding for capitalized personal property procurements for the Naval Shipyards and Fleet I-level maintenance activities.  These procurements provide new and efficiency-enabling equipment required to support submarine, CVN, and surface ship maintenance, eliminating reliance on significantly aged and obsolete equipment.  Average age of existing equipment infrastructure is 21 years, over twice the average age of comparable private industry equipment.  Improved maintenance capabilities at the activities supported by the Capital Investment Program and Ship Maintenance Investment Program are integral to the Nuclear Enterprise.  Modernizing equipment infrastructure improves maintenance activity productivity, eliminates workaround and mitigation costs to the Fleet, contributes to decreasing CVN, surface ship, and submarine availability cost and schedule, and improves operational availability.

This budget also funds procurement and technical refresh upgrades of all Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) hardware and software aboard Surface Fleet hulls and the Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES).  NMMES is a strategic investment that has standardized NAVSEA and Fleet ship maintenance functions ashore, controlling and managing all aspects of ship maintenance at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), and Ship Repair Facilities.

[P40A / KN100:  INDUSTRIAL PLANT EQUIPMENT (IPE) REPLACEMENT/AFLOAT SUPPORT]: These funds are used to procure industrial plant equipment for afloat (surface combatant) activities which provide maintenance capabilities for Sailors to maintain Ship's mission essential, operational readiness while deployed.  The upgraded IPE increases deployed maintenance capability and enhances strike group's ability to remain on station through Casualty Report (CASREP) avoidance.  The program provides new industrial plant equipment to replace equipment beyond economical repair and to upgrade capabilities for ship maintenance and repair.

[P40A / KN200:  NAVY MARITIME MAINTENANCE ENTERPRISE SOLUTION SUSTAINMENT]: This funding supports the Navy Maritime Maintenance Enterprise Solution (NMMES) Initiative, a strategic investment that has standardized NAVSEA and Fleet ship maintenance functions ashore, controlling and managing all aspects of ship maintenance at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs), and Ship Repair Facilities.  NMMES manages finance, supply, personnel, time &amp; attendance, repair work processes &amp; planning, scheduling and execution, shop work flow, configuration management, environmental health &amp; safety, quality assurance, up-line management reporting and other functions.  NMMES standardizes and institutionalizes the Navy's ship maintenance business practice processes.  These processes are fully embedded in the NMMES IT systems to gain efficiencies in the maintenance process.  NMMES systems provide the functionality and processes to continually address the maintenance needs of the Fleet, and have a critical role in the efficient brokering, planning, material ordering, financial performance, and execution of shore maintenance.  

This sustainment funding will support procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software in support of NMMES IT systems, including the Electronic Technical Work Document (ETWD) initiative.

[P40A / NAVY MARITIME MAINTENANCE ENTERPRISE SOLUTION SUSTAINMENT]: FY18 NMMES funding above FY17 level is required for hardware supporting the Maritime Systems Environment (MSE 1.1) alternate production site that will also be the disaster recovery failover site located at Marine Corps Kansas City Enterprise IT Center (EITC).  This will enable the maintenance activities to continue working &amp; utilizing the IT toolset when the primary site is undergoing maintenance or a shutdown is required as there was during hurricane Matthew.  Funds will also support Product Data Management (PDM) software (SW) to integrate FORD Class Carrier Program and OHIO Replacement Program (ORP) configuration and technical information during maintenance periods.

[P40A / eTWD NEDC Hardware]: The electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) system hardware (HW) requirements are for servers required to support and sustain the eTWD environments at Navy Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) Charleston, SC, in support of data center consolidation initiative.

[P40A / MSE 1.1 Alt. Production Site]: The Maritime Systems Environment (MSE 1.1) alternate production site will act as the emergency production site if Navy Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) Charleston has catastrophic event.  The alternate production site environment will be located at Marine Corps Kansas City Enterprise IT Center (EITC), and will provide minimal impact to ship maintenance business systems if shutdown to NEDC Charleston occurs.  Kansas City EITC also serves as the disaster recovery failover site.  This will enable the maintenance activities to continue working &amp; utilizing the IT toolset when the primary site is undergoing maintenance or a shutdown is required as there was during hurricane Matthew. This procures the information technology hardware to build the alternate production site for the Naval Shipyards and Regional Maintenance Centers.

[P40A / Product Data Management SW]: Product Data Management (PDM) software (SW) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software to integrate FORD Class Carrier Program and OHIO Replacement Program (ORP) configuration and technical information during maintenance periods.

[P40A / Mobility Solutions]: Provides for the development of applications and software tools to support mobility initiatives at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers and Ship Repair Facility (SRF) Japan. This capability leverages off the wireless network and electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) projects and brings needed efficiencies to ship maintenance workers.

[P40A / RFIDs]: This project implements Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) capability at the Naval Shipyards, Regional Maintenance Centers, and Ship Repair Facility (SRF) Japan for both waterfront and back-shop application.  RFID will provide real-time tracking of parts and materials, creating a more efficient and productive workflow.

[P40A / KN300:  SHIPYARD CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CIP)]: This line item provides funding for the Shipyard Capital Investment Program in support of the consolidated Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facilities (IMF) at the four mission funded Naval Shipyards.  Funds will be used for the procurement and execution of Class 3 &amp; 4 plant and personal property projects to maintain, modernize and improve the infrastructure and industrial base at the mission funded Naval Shipyard/IMF activities.  Funding will allow for the acquisition of equipment and OP,N related Automated Data Processing (ADP) Hardware/Software necessary to perform the mission of repairing, conversion, and modernization of fleet ships and submarines in the most economical, efficient, environmentally sound and safe manner possible.

NOTE that the budget year equipment requirements provided in this exhibit are based on current Shipyard priorities to best improve submarine and aircraft carrier availability execution within currently projected budget.  Projected costs are best government estimates based on market research and are subject to change.  Changes to program funding, realized costs, and/or realization of emergent Shipyard equipment requirements after budget submittal could impact the requirements identified in this exhibit.

[P40A / SHIPYARD CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM (CIP)]: Average age of existing naval shipyard capital equipment infrastructure is 21 years, over twice the average age of comparable private industry equipment.  Continued reliance on this significantly aged equipment infrastructure increases submarine and CVN availability costs and places schedules at risk.  This results in passing workaround costs to the Fleet and ultimately impacting Operational Availability (Ao) when equipment downtime impacts critical path maintenance requirements.  

Improved maintenance capabilities at the Naval Shipyards are integral to the Nuclear Enterprise.  Procurement of new and efficiency-enabling equipment to repair CVNs and submarines contributes to decreasing availability costs and schedules, ultimately returning mission days to the Fleet and moving the needle on Shipyard throughput.

FY18 Capital Investment Program funding above FY17 level is required for capital equipment needed at the Naval Shipyards to support new mission requirements, including VIRGINIA Class introduction at NNSY and concurrent VIRGINIA Class availabilities at PNSY and PHNSY, as well as recapitalization of significantly aged Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE), weight handling equipment, and nuclear support equipment infrastructure.  These additional requirements include:

PHNS&amp;IMF VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR HANDLING SYSTEM - This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs) and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities.  Without this procurement, PHNS&amp;IMF will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance.  This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions.  

NNSY VIRGINIA CLASS BOW DOME HANDLING SYSTEM - The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity.  The bow handling system procurement is critical to NNSYs mission to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance, which was accelerated with the Norfolk homeporting of USS JOHN WARNER.  

PNSY and PSNSY REACTOR ACCESS ENCLOSURES (RAEs) (2 TOTAL):  These RAEs are required to support increasing submarine inactivation schedule tempo.  Existing RAEs being replaced by these procurements are well beyond expected service life, require extensive repairs between uses, and add 6 weeks to availability critical path schedule each use for setup and teardown that won't be required with the new RAE design.  These RAEs are critically needed at PSNSY and PNSY in order to support the LOS ANGELES Class inactivation availability schedules.    

PSNSY (BREMERTON SITE) 25 TON PORTAL CRANE PROCUREMENTS (2 TOTAL) - This project procures two new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal cranes for PSNS&amp;IMF, Bremerton (Shipyard site).  This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the Shipyard that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands.  This crane is designed to fill a critical capability gap for pier and dry dock support, with appropriate capacity, hook height and reach for carrier support, general lower capacity pier and drydock support, for the In-activation, Recycling and Disposal program.  Continued reliance on existing crane population will continue exposure to increasing costs to customer due to lack of support causing delays to the projects, increasing costs to maintain, support, and operate rental/lease cranes, and increasing costs and lower efficiency  using higher capacity portal cranes to lift lighter, repetitive loads.

PHNSY SEAWATER ACID FLUSH SYSTEM - This project procures a submarine Seawater Acid Flush System used for chemically cleaning copper-nickel alloy seawater cooling systems and components.  Without this portable acid flush system, PHNSY will continue to perform mechanical cleanings of fouled seawater cooling systems, continuing to place availability schedules at risk when fouling conditions are found as well as eliminating an unobtrusive, rapid defouling option when emergent seawater system fouling conditions occur, typically in warm water conditions.  This acid flush system is the only method available to complete any emergent SW system cleanings on operational submarines. The only other method of system cleaning is during a depot availability, requiring affected components, tubing, and piping to be entirely removed, hydro-blasted, inspected, and reinstalled. 

NNSY and PSNSY 60 TON DOCK CRANES SERVICE LIFE EXTENSIONS (3 TOTAL) - Integral to waterfront operations.  Dock cranes perform 8,000 lifts per submarine availability supporting critical path maintenance operations.  These $2M - $3M service life extensions are being performed instead of $30M (each) new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.  

PSNSY VERTICLE RECIPROCATING CONVEYOR - This project replaces the existing 23 year old four-ton capacity Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor (VRC) installed in Dry Dock 04 at PSNSY.  The new VRC will be designed to be submersible and therefore can remain in dock while flooding operations occur, significantly lowering VRC operating costs.  The shipyard currently must execute workarounds due to increasing, significant downtime of the existing VRC, increasing costs due to use of a constrained Portal Crane population to move relatively light loads to support dry dock operations and increasing exposure to potentially unsafe work conditions. This is particularly germane given the anticipated increased in workload at this dry dock.

[P40A / NETWORK STORAGE &amp; BACKUP]: This procurement supports the technical refresh of existing storage servers on the legacy network at NNSY.

[P40A / CVN 68/78 CAMEL SYSTEM]: Camel system required to berth aircraft carriers at NNSY.  Existing system is well beyond expected service life and will not support current tidal and storm surge requirements.

[P40A / VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR HANDLING SYSTEM]: This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs) and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities. Without this procurement, PNSY will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance. This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions.

[P40A / VIRGINIA CLASS BOW DOME RING HANDLING SYSTEM]: This project procures a bow dome handling system for PNSY. The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity. Without the bow handling system procurement, PNSY will be unable to perform mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements.

[P40A / VIRGINIA CLASS PROPULSOR ENCLOSURE]: Required to support concurrent VIRGINIA Class dry dock availabilities at PNSY. This project provides a set of three partially enclosed towers and connecting roof that will be used individually or in combination to support Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tile repair, hull inspection, sonar dome repair, hull penetration repair, submarine access, equipment mounting and collectively to support VIRGINIA Class propulsor/shaft replacement.

[P40A / INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DATA STORAGE REFRESH]: This project replaces Information Technology (IT) storage equipment at PNSY, including all existing production NetApp filers and associated disks and hardware which contain all of the electronic data for shipyard operations. Supports the legacy network (SYLAN), Global Maintenance Application Suite (GMAS), and Secured Network (SECNET).

[P40A / PORTAL CRANE, 60 TON, MODERNIZATION]: Modernization/Service Life Extension project for one PNSY 60 ton portal crane. This service life extension is being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurement.  Existing portal crane is beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution. Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts). Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive. New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements. Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines. Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.

[P40A / WINDOWS SERVER TECHNICAL REFRESH]: This project supports the planned tech refresh of end-of-life (EOL) Windows servers on the legacy network (CMDNET) at PSNS &amp; IMF.  This will result in the procurement and implementation of a suite of virtual software and hardware infrastructure to conform to the DONCIO directive to virtualize all systems by the end of 2017.

[P40A / DIESEL GENERATORS, EMERGENCY]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at PHNS&amp;IMF in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster. Failure to procure a temporary generator sets will leave the submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.

[P40A / MODERNIZE 60 TON PORTAL CRANES]: Modernization/Service Life Extension project for PSNS&amp;IMF 60 ton portal cranes. These service life extensions are being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution. Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).

[P40A / EMERGENCY DIESEL GENERATORS]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at NNSY in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster. Failure to procure a temporary generator sets will leave the submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.

[P40A / 25 TON PORTAL CRANE - IMF BANGOR]: This project procures a new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal crane for PSNS&amp;IMF, IMF Bangor site delta pier. This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the IMF that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands.

[P40A / DRY DOCK #1 DEFUELING COMPLEX]: This project funds a defueling complex located at PNSY Dry Dock #1. The project will support Fleet's need for simultaneous Virginia Class Depot level maintenance availabilities and concurrent Los Angeles Class inactivations. The complex footprint consists of portable enclosures and services: Two M140 container service and rail car enclosures, an access control enclosure, Dockside Refueling Enclosure, a series of passageways, ventilation equipment, electrical services, fire alarm, and crane services.

[P40A / DRY DOCK #2 MATERIAL HIGHWAY]: This is a design-build project for a VIRGINIA Class material handling system (Material Highway (MH)) consisting of equipment platforms, enclosures with pneumatic hoists and manual davit hoist, bridges, carts, manual pallet trucks, Vertical Reciprocating Conveyors (VRCs), and support towers for Dry Dock 2 (DD2) at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY).

[P40A / VIRGINIA Class Vertical Launch System Platform]: This project provides a safe means to perform VIRGINIA Class Vertical Launch System (VLS) work at NNSY. All VLS related work requires a VLS Platform to be installed. This is particularly true for any waterborne work as the VLS bathtub area cannot be safely staged in the water. A VLS Platform is typically installed as soon as the ship arrives for an availability to support equipment offload and is then reinstalled shortly after Undocking and typically remains installed through the remainder of the availability up until Fast Cruise.  Without this investment NNSY will be unable to meet maintenance requirements for future Virginia Class availabilities.

[P40A / Hydraulic Component Test System]: This project provides PHNS&amp;IMF a new hydraulic testing system that tests valves, actuators, pressure regulators, accumulators and other miscellaneous hydraulic components. The Entwistle testing system currently used is over 10 years old and past its useful life period. The Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU) and Cooling Tower are corroded and flaking due to being outside on a concrete slab and exposed to Hawaii's environment.  Recently, one of the HPU's doors rusted off. Due to the condition of the equipment, it had an average breakdown rate of 4 times per year through 2015.  Since then, breakdown rate has increased to 8 times per year.  This system is critically needed at PHNSY to reduce operational capacity shortfalls and breakdowns, resulting in overtime to meet schedule without being equip for future needs.

[P40A / Dry Dock 1 Reactor Access Enclosure System and Support Structure]: This project will fund a RAE (Reactor Access Enclosure) structure and support system for PNSY DD (Dry Dock) #1. The project will support FLEET's need for simultaneous LOS ANGELES Class inactivations.  This capability will allow the shipyard to be able to service multiple reactors in the Dry Docks and meet meet the Fleets Scheduled Requirement of simultaneous inactivations starting in FY22.

[P40A / VIRGINIA Class Bow Dome Ring]: This project procures a bow dome handling system for PHNSY and NNSY.  The bow handling system is attached to the VIRGINIA Class bow dome and is used to remove, store, and reinstall the dome during depot availabilities IAW current depot maintenance plan. VIRGINIA Class bow domes are made of GRP so the ring must remain installed the entire time the bow dome is removed to ensure it retains the required circularity. The bow dome handling system procurement is crucially needed at NNSY and PHNSY to perform mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements.

[P40A / 7000 Gallon Waste Water Collection Tanks]: Required by PHNS&amp;IMF to store and dispose of radiological waste liquids collected during depot maintenance evolutions.  Existing tanks are beyond operable service life and rehabilitation costs exceed new procurement cost.  Procurement will reduce maintenance costs and radiological risk/exposure to personnel.

[P40A / Portable Paint Room]: This project procures a new portable, cross draft ventilated 50' x 50' x 22' paint enclosure for PNSY to support painting operations during submarine depot availabilities.  The current paint room is part of an old building that's scheduled for demolition.  This capability crucially needed at PNSY in order to be able to overhaul submarines.

[P40A / Relief Valve Test Platform]: A Relief Valve Test Platform (RVTP) is required to support all SSBN/SSGN 726 Class availabilities at IMF, Bangor and PSNS.  The RVTP is placed directly on the submarine's turtleback and it provides the enclosures, structure, and platforms necessary to support piping installations, safe radiological work areas, and placement of a large liquid waste (RLW) tank to perform the test while the submarine is waterborne.  The proposed work enclosure will provide a working surface to support piping and the RLW tank as well as provide a rigid steel framed weather enclosure for all work areas.  This will be replacing the current platform which only supports and encloses the piping portion of the system, and requires use of temporary staging and shrink-wrap to enclose the RLW tank.

SSBN/SSGN 726 Class Relief valve testing is critical path work.  The existing RVTP has been in use for ten years, is at the end of its useful life, and has multiple safety and design deficiencies.  Current nuclear standards have placed the shipyard's existing RVTP out of compliance.  Required modifications to keep it operational have resulted in an RVTP not optimized for its mission.  Therefore this equipment has become a critical path scheduling concern.  A new RVTP will comply with nuclear standards, reduce critical path impact, improve operational safety, reduce labor, and optimize test functionality.

[P40A / VIRGINIA Class Sail Racetrack Platform]: The project procures a VIRGINIA Class Sail "Racetrack" for NNSY.  This is a work platform that is installed around the top of the Sail with a crane that allows personnel access to safely work Masts, UMMs, Sail Access Plates, etc. on the upper section of the Sail.  This platform is mandatory for NNSY to complete sail restoration and maintenance on Virginia Class submarines.

[P40A / Pure Water Delivery Trailer]: This is a turnkey project to procure two (2) Pure Water delivery Trailers (PWTs) for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY).  PWTs are 6,000 gallon stainless steel tanks integrated onto double axle semi-trailers with water fill/delivery piping and water delivery pump that meet the stringent cleanliness requirements for nuclear powered ships and submarines.  This project will provide replacement PWTs for 29 year old PWT #19 and 21 year old PWT #4.

PWT #4 and PWT #19 must be replaced due to being more than 10 years past their useful service life, unreliable, costly to maintain, and exhibiting corrosion stress cracking. In 2015, PWT #19 was deemed un-repairable and put out-of-service earlier than expected due to cracks on the vent piping. PWTs are required for PHNSY to maintain its nuclear license and are required for PHNSY to be a full service shipyard for nuclear powered ships and submarines.  Failure to execute this project will result in the PHNSY operating increasingly unreliable PWTs and increased probability PW deliveries will be delayed, potentially delaying submarine deployment, maintenance, and testing.

[P40A / Reactor Access Enclosure Training Base Design]: This project funds the design deliverable for a RAE (Radiological Access Enclosure) Training Base located at PNSY Dry Dock #1. The project will support the Fleet's need for simultaneous submarine inactivations at PNSY. The RAE footprint consists of a structural storage base a passageway, electrical services, communications and fire alarms.  Without this capability, the shipyard will only be able to train to service reactors in one dry dock, failing to meet the Fleet schedule and training requirements for simultaneous inactivations starting in 2022.

[P40A / Modernize 60 Ton Portal Cranes - PSNS&amp;IMF]: Modernization/Service Life Extension project for two PNS&amp;IMF 60 ton portal cranes.  These $3M service life extensions are being performed instead of $30M (each) new crane procurements.  Existing portal cranes are beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.

[P40A / VIRGINIA Class VIRGINIA Payload Tube (VPT) Platform]: This project provides a safe means to perform VIRGINIA Class VPT maintenance at NNSY.  All VPT-related work requires a VPT Platform to be installed. This is particularly true for any waterborne work as the VPT bathtub area cannot be safely staged in the water. A VPT Platform is typically installed as soon as the ship arrives for an availability to support equipment offload and is then reinstalled shortly after Undocking and typically remains installed through the remainder of the availability up until Fast Cruise.  Without this investment, NNSY will be unable to meet VIRGINIA Class maintenance requirements.

[P40A / Submarine Maintenance Enclosure]: Required by PHNS&amp;IMF to support concurrent VIRGINIA Class dry dock availabilities.  This project provides a set of three partially enclosed towers and connecting roof that will be used individually or in combination to support Special Hull Treatment (SHT) tile repair, hull inspection, sonar dome repair, hull penetration repair, submarine access, equipment mounting and collectively to support VIRGINIA Class propulsor/shaft replacement.  If this project is not funded in FY18, PHNS&amp;IMF will face difficulty in meeting VIRGINIA Class overhaul completion dates within projected costs due to inefficient existing practice of using scaffolding, makeshift platforms &amp; herculite. Simultaneous VIRGINIA Class availabilities are scheduled beginning in FY20.

[P40A / PNSY Pump Test Station Modernization]: The B300 pump test station is used to perform shop testing for non-nuclear submarine pump &amp; motor units for a wide range of pump sizes; 1.5" inlet diameter to 20" inlet diameter.  The testing ensures satisfactory operation of Shipyard overhauled pumps and motor units as well as those provided by the Advanced Equipment Repair Program (AERP).  This project will fund the replacement/upgrade of the pump test station electrical system which consists of the motor control centers, test station control consoles, and test station power outlets, as well as replace outdated flow meters.

The current pump test station was designed in 1980. The system is old and unreliable and replacement parts are obsolete and difficult to obtain.  The system is not in compliance with today's electrical code (NEC) and an electrical safety risk.

[P40A / Emergency Diesel Generators]: These generators will provide emergency backup power to the nuclear vessels at NNSY, PHNS&amp;IMF, and PNSY in the event of an electrical power failure, implementing lessons learned from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster.  These generators are crucial when precluding submarines berthed and dry docked at these shipyards to be vulnerable to potential blackout scenarios and unable to meet all requirements.

[P40A / 25 Ton Portal Cranes]: This project procures two new high hook speed, moderate capacity (25-ton) portal cranes for PSNS&amp;IMF, Bremerton (Shipyard site).  This procurement directly supports an increase in workload for the Shipyard that requires additional portal cranes to meet project demands. This crane is designed to fill a critical capability gap for pier and dry dock support, with appropriate capacity, hook height and reach for carrier support, general lower capacity pier and drydock support, for the In-activation, Recycling and Disposal program. Continued reliance on existing crane population will continue exposure to increasing costs to customer due to lack of support causing delays to the projects, increasing costs to maintain, support, and operate rental/lease cranes, and increasing costs and lower efficiency using higher capacity portal cranes to lift lighter, repetitive loads.

[P40A / VIRGINIA Class Propulsor Handling System]: This system provides stacking stands, platforms, Heavy Lift Transporters (HLTs), and the necessary Lifting and Handling system to remove, stow, and reinstall the VIRGINIA Class Propulsor and shaft assembly during depot availabilities. Without this procurement, PHNS&amp;IMF will be unable to support assigned VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance.  This is the only approved system design for executing these precise and demanding Propulsor and shaft maintenance actions. PHNS&amp;IMF cannot support mandatory, critical path VIRGINIA Class depot maintenance requirements without this equipment.

[P40A / Modernize 60 Ton Portal Crane - NNSY]: Modernization/Service Life Extension project for one NNSY 60 ton portal crane.  This $2M service life extension is being performed instead of a $30M new crane procurement.  Existing portal crane is beyond reasonable service life, which decreases reliability, increases cost, and undermines mission execution.  Dockside cranes must provide safe, reliable, and efficient weight handling of Fleet system components (e.g. nuclear, weapons, platforms, sensitive material and high cost parts).  Replacing obsolete parts, such as obsolete electronic drive control components, is becoming cost prohibitive.  New diesel generators are more efficient and have reduced emissions that meet current EPA requirements.  Engine overhauls are more costly than the replacement cost of new more appropriately sized engines.  Installation of a drum brake on the 15-ton whip hoist will bring that hoist into compliance with current design requirements.

[P40A / Seawater Acid Flush System]: This project procures a submarine Seawater Acid Flush System used for chemically cleaning copper-nickel alloy seawater cooling systems and components. Without this portable acid flush system, PHNSY will continue to perform mechanical cleanings of fouled seawater cooling systems, continuing to place availability schedules at risk when fouling conditions are found as well as eliminating an unobtrusive, rapid defouling option when emergent seawater system fouling conditions occur, typically in warm water conditions. This acid flush system is the only method available to complete any emergent SW system cleanings on operational submarines. The only other method of system cleaning is during a depot availability, requiring affected components, tubing, and piping to be entirely removed, hydro-blasted, inspected, and reinstalled.

[P40A / Submarine Camel System]: This project procures one set of universal submarine camels (2 camels) to berth subs at NNSY piers.  The proposed camel measures about 36' along the pier, 18' from pier to submarine hull, and 18' top to bottom. The camel features composite panels, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) rubber rub strips, arch fenders, lifting bars, cleats, non-slip surface coating, concrete and steel ballast.  Without this camel system, NNSY will be unable to support scheduled VIRGINIA Class maintenance assignments.

[P40A / CNC Shaft Lathe]: This project procures a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) shaft lathe required by PNSY to support submarine shaft maintenance as well as to perform refurbishment to rotatable pool CVN and submarine shafts.  This project replaces the 70 ft. Betts Lathe and the RDD Shaft Lathe with a new 80 ton, 80 foot center-center CNC Shaft Lathe. The new CNC shaft lathe will have milling and grinding capabilities, which the current asset does not. It will also be capable of moving the carriage from end to end without removing the shaft or steady rests. This feature allows the new CNC Shaft lathe to accomplish sleeve chamfering that is not readily allowed on other shaft lathes.  

The existing shaft lathes to be replaced and undersized, outdated, and beyond economical repair. These assets can no longer provide the required dimensional accuracy for shafting processes and is currently used only for stripping fiberglass and coatings. The assets are operating at the upper limits of their capacity when machining 50 ton propulsion shafts. Completion falls inside the critical path for these evolutions. This project is required to maintain core capabilities and meet projected workload.

[P40A / Defueling Complex - Design]: This project funds development of the deliverable design package consisting of engineered drawings and all technical criteria for procurement of a Multi-Class Submarine Defueling Complex for PSNS&amp;IMF Dry Dock 2 (DD2).  The complex consists of two M-140 Enclosures with cranes, one Radiological Access Enclosure (RAE) with a crane, one RAE Annex, several Support Enclosures also with cranes, a Change Enclosure, radiological ventilation, and process support equipment.

Age of existing defueling equipment this procurement will recapitalize is 27 - 45 years.  This equipment requires frequent repairs between uses, workarounds during use, and are personnel safety risks.  Execution of the new design, when completed, will improve efficiencies during submarine defueling operations, reducing schedule and avoiding workaround, repair, and rework costs.

[P40A / Dual Media Discharge Enclosures - NNSY]: Dual Media Discharge (DMD) Enclosures are large structures that enable safe and controlled discharge of radioactive Media for nuclear systems maintenance. This system will be made up of stackable connex boxes. The system will support all submarine classes at NNSY and TRIDENT Refit Facility (TRF) Kings Bay (KB).

The existing DMD enclosure at NNSY is 29 years old. The tower assembley used at the NRMD was turned over from Trident Refit Facility Kings Bay in 2007 and is reaching its end of life. Existing equipment has trouble maintaining environmental controls. During rain storms NNSY has experienced leaking inside the enclosure due to rusted and deteriorating external walls and sealing components.  This equipment is a critical need of the shipyards and TRF KB in order to collect radioactive media and have the ability to perform assigned maintenance responsibilities.

[P40A / Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor]: This project replaces the existing 23 year old four-ton capacity Vertical Reciprocating Conveyor (VRC) installed in Dry Dock 04 at PSNSY. The new VRC will be designed to be submersible and therefore can remain in dock while flooding operations occur, significantly lowering VRC operating costs. The shipyard currently must execute workarounds due to increasing, significant downtime of the existing VRC, increasing costs due to use of a constrained Portal Crane population to move relatively light loads to support dry dock operations and increasing exposure to potentially unsafe work conditions. This is particularly germane given the anticipated increased in workload at this dry dock.

[P40A / Dual Media Discharge Complex]: The Dual Media Discharge (DMD) Complex is an integrated assembly of portable enclosures used for higher-risk off-hull effluent collection work on OHIO Class submarines.  A new DMD Complex is required to replace the 25-year old DMD Complex at IMF Bangor, which has exceeded its design service life.  The new Bangor DMD Complex consists of a Control Point Enclosure (to control access and support remote monitoring of critical work), a Portable Radioactive Waste Collection (PRWC) Tank Enclosure (provides weather protection for the PRWC Tank and discharge hose), and a Modular Tower that houses the Low Pressure Resin Catch (LPRC) Tank and required liquid transfer equipment.  The modular tower supports access to the submarine and provides weather protection for the LPRC Tank, discharge hose and associated equipment.  The DMD complex is equipped with service air, lights, heating and cooling, fire alarm system, adjustable work platforms to install and monitor equipment, permanent shielding, and stairs to reach the various levels of the complex.

NOTE that this project recapitalizes the entire DMD Complex, where NNSY's comparable project only recapitalizes the DMD enclosures (modular towers without the LPRC tank).

[P40A / Modify M-140 Enclosures- Design]: This project funds the design deliverable package that will define the modifications necessary to simplify fuel transfer operations in existing PSNS&amp;IMF M-140 defueling enclosures.  The modifications will increase hook height 4 feet to eliminate the cumbersome process of connecting and disconnecting fuel handling tool columns.  Additional upgrades include:  seismic survivability, ventilation, lighting, a new tool column rack (to hold the connected tool columns), a new rigging platform (to reach the tool columns for attachment of rigging gear), new lower work level floor mods, and a stairwell to reach each work level given its new change in height.

Refueling of TRIDENT and LOS ANGELES class reactor plants involves using two tool column extensions that couple together to lower fuel out the refueling container into an M-140 shipping container.  The tool columns are suspended by a crane inside of the structure.  The Shipyard's existing M-140 Enclosures do not have sufficient crane hook height to allow the two tool column extensions to remain connected between uses.  With the current shorter design of the M-140 enclosures, for each fuel transfer cycle, the fuel cell must be partially lowered into the M-140 container then have the second tool column extension lifted into place and coupled to the first section to complete the discharge into the M-140 container.  This operation adds approximately one to 1-1/2 hours to each fuel cell being transferred.  The added time and the added operations increase the radiation exposure of personnel, increase the potential for radiological problems, and increase wear on refueling equipment and possible equipment problems during the fuel transfer cycle.  This re-design increases hook height so that the tool column extensions can remain coupled together during fuel transfer operations in the M-140 enclosures.  This re-design will also include all seismic requirements.

[P40A / 2,000 Ton Press Brake]: This project is to procure a 2,000 ton Computer Numerical Control (CNC) hydraulic press brake for the PSNS&amp;IMF Shipfitter Shop.  The existing machine, installed over 20 years ago, is obsolete, unsupported by the OEM, unreliable, and is currently down.  This reduced reliability and extended downtime has resulted in shop production schedule delays.  In many cases, there are no approved alternate methods for fabrication of the structural components.

[P40A / NETWORK DATA STORAGE CLUSTER]: This project provides automatically switched redundancy and additional network storage for PNSY's Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Network (NNPPNet or SECNET) and the Corporate Emergency Control Center (CECC).  This added system capability to switch over automatically upon failure of the primary system in Bldg 170/6 will allow the CECC to remain fully functional in an emergency situation and also allow the NNPPNet to continue to operate uninterrupted.  The existing Network Storage System devices does not provide redundancy to CECC in the event of the loss of connectivity to Bldg 170/6.  The existing assets provide connectivity to critical Information Systems that are accessed by the Nuclear Engineering Department, NRRO office, Business office, Engineering Supply, RADCON, SOMS, Project Teams and Administration.  Loss of access to this data due to equipment failure would cause NNPPNet (SECNET) to become unavailable to the work force and impede shipyard productivity.

[P40A / Local Traffic Manager]: This project supports a technology refresh of the PNSY's web application environment with the procurement and installation of four (4) Local Traffic Manager (LTM) switches.  These Local Traffic Manager (LTM) switches are integral to the Shipyard's web application architecture; they provide the required functionality of load-balancing, Transport Layer Security (TLS) acceleration and offloading, online maintenance without denial of service, and FIPS 140-2 (TLS) and Common Criteria security.  FIPS 140-2 is required by Navy policy and DoD Directive 8502.2. 

The replacement of LTM switches is mandatory for vendor-supported security updates and configurations required by DoD, DoN, and NETWARCOM.  End of support for our existing LTM switches will prevent compliance with DoD, DoN, and NWC directives.  The inability to meet security requirements will open the shipyard to vulnerabilities.  In addition, lack of compliance could jeopardize or cause termination of our network accreditation. The new LTM operating system will support all current IAVA and CTO requirements in support of maintaining Cyber Secure network.

[P40A / Horizontal Boring Mill]: This project procures a 5-axis horizontal boring mill that will replace a 24 year old boring mill that is severly worn, has exceeded maximum reasonable service life, only has a 4-axis capacity, and frequently breaks down for repairs.  Due to the age, replacement parts have become increasingly more difficult to obtain, which adds to the downtime. Reliability and accuracy is poor and extra care and time are required to even perform simple machining operations.  Many shop projects require 5-axis capability and the only 5-axis boring mill at PHNSY&amp;IMF is 12 year old boring mill that is also beyond it's service life and frequently down for repairs.

[P40A / CRANE, TRUCK MOUNTED, 300 TON]: This project provides PHNSY a General Purpose Service (GPS) mobile crane with a nominal capacity of 300 tons. The high capacity mobile crane is needed to replace the existing high capacity mobile crane that will be 17 year old in 2018.  Expected service life for a mobile crane is 10 years.  

This high capacity mobile crane is needed to support fleet maintenance submarine and surface ship work at Naval Base Pearl Harbor.  The crane is needed to support lifting operations at Submarine Base Pearl Harbor where the shipyard does not have lifting capabilities with a portal crane.  The crane will be used to lift submarine sonar domes, submarine propellers, sail platforms, rudder staging and other high capacity or long reach lifts.  In a typical year the crane makes over 1200 lifts in support of maintenance work.

[P40A / LATHE, TURNING CENTER, 6"]: This project procures PNSY a Computerized Numerically Controlled (CNC) turning center with milling capabilities for the manufacture of cylindrical shaped submarine components.  Current equipment is 20 years old and is well beyond its predicted service life, mechanically worn-out, equipped with unsupportable, obsolete, numerical controls.  The original equipment manufacturer is no longer making replacement parts.  Rebuild will not alleviate the parts issue and would require an extensive one-of-a-kind CNC control interface and retrofit with little or no gained efficiency. Due to the limited capabilities and deterioration of the current 4" turning center a large majority of the work is partially done on smaller lathes which require multiple setup times due to size constraints. The best solution is to purchase one machine with both turning and milling capability allowing the manufacture of parts requiring both types of machining operations to be done in one set-up. Hours of moving parts and machine set-up will be avoided.  This would also free up other assets and machinists in the shop for other productive work.

[P40A / Information Technology Storage System]: This project replaces Information Technology (IT) storage equipment of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY &amp; IMF), including all existing production NetApp filers and associated disks and hardware which contain all of the electronic data for shipyard operations. Supports the legacy network (SYLAN), Global Maintenance Application Suite (GMAS), and Secured Network (SECNET).  

Storage systems five years or older are less reliable, more prone to failure, and technologically obsolete. Current storage equipment has been in use since 2012 and now experiences failures at least monthly. Design redundancy and maintenance have negated major outages thus far, but the equipment should be replaced before such an outage takes place as it would severely impact every aspect of shipyard business including financial, material ordering, ship overhaul planning, and performance analysis.

This equipment is critical for all applications and data used to overhaul submarines and for security access control at PHNSY. This includes all data on virtual servers (Windows and UNIX), Oracle/SQL backend databases for corporate and local applications, file shares, ship drawing and instructions, SharePoint intranet web, and physical security access control IT systems.

[P40A / Spherical Grinding Machine]: This project procures a spherical grinding machine capable of grinding valve balls between 1" and 24" diameter to an accuracy of 0.0001" roundness.  This machine will be installed at PSNS&amp;IMF, Bangor in Shop 31A's grinding room.

Grinding valve balls for SEAWOLF and other class submarines is a new mission in PSNS&amp;IMF.  SEAWOLF Class and Trident Class submarines have short availabilities, by resurfacing existing valve balls underway schedules will not be jeopardized by long lead time or back ordered valve balls.

[P40A / High Pressure Air Compressor]: This project will purchase a universal High Pressure Air Compressor System to provide high pressure air to submarines under repair PNSY's Point Loma detachment. The high pressure air compressor system (HPAC) shall be designed and engineered to consist of a primary high pressure air compressor (HPAC) connected with a redundant compressor to provide uninterrupted HP air in the event of primary unit failure. The twin HPACs will be interconnected for redundancy, include a heat exchanger/fan for each compressor, and supply 90 SCFM at 5000 psi. The compressors will be configured for unattended automatic operation (with remote sensing) and have self-contained membrane dehydrators. 

Currently Point Loma does not have enough equipment or facilities to provide HP air to all submarines under repair at the submarine base. When a submarine's onboard HP air system is down for maintenance an alternate air source must be provided to support the ship's reactor and secondary air needs.  Currently, in order to fulfill this requirement HPACs are rented for the necessary durations for each availability.  Annual rental costs exceed acquisition cost.

[P40A / Freeze Seal Compressor Systems]: This project procures four new freeze seal compressor systems for NNSY to provide dry compressed air for vortex freeze seal applications.  Vortex freeze seals are used to support repairs to piping, valves and/or piping components in situations where the pipe cannot be isolated by any other means.  

These freeze seal systems support repairs on nuclear piping that is frequently internally radioactively contaminated. Failure or loss of a freeze seal while in the middle of a repair could have catastrophic consequences.  A reliable continuous supply of dry compressed air is critical to maintaining freeze seals. NNSY's existing freeze seal systems are over 25 yards old and are well past their useful life.

[P40A / Steam Test Stand - Design]: This project funds the design deliverable that will be used to modernize NNSY's existing steam test stand.  This new design will will re-organize the shop with a more efficient workflow alignment, replace out-dated equipment and corroded pipes which contaminate test articles and violate Steam Plant Clean requirements.  The shops will realize lower operating costs, faster test setups, and shorter test start/complete cycles and compliance.  This design will also replace existing boilers with modern, digitially controlled, high-efficiency boilers, replace all steam pipe with chrome-moly steel, install fixed manifolds for the Grade A water trailer, relocate the existing accumulator outside of the work area, install (2) dedicated relief valve test stands powered with properly sized electric steam generators, and install two large valve test stands powered by properly sized gas-fired steam generators.

It is expected that the design deliverable will require 12 months to complete after awarded, so the resulting modernization effort executing the completed design deliverable is projected for FY20.

NNSY is tasked with testing steam system valves and reliefs from surface ships and subs.  The existing boilers and test stands cannot consistently provide dry steam for testing leading to seal damage and rework of valves/reliefs.  Until this new modernization design is completed and executed, the shop will not be capable of testing the larger pumps and valves now being inducted and anticipated in the future in the required turn-around time constraints nor avoid reworks due to poor quality steam.

[P40A / Plasma Cutting System]: This project provides a new "State-of-the-Art" Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) plasma cutting system for the Structural Shop in Building 155 at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard &amp; IMF (PHNSY).  The new system will have a CNC control system, water or down draft cutting table, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting torches, and be capable of cutting plates up to 10' X 20" X 6" thick.

Existing Heath plasma cutting machine is 40 years old, obsolete, and repair parts are no longer available; therefore, this machine will not be repairable once the repair parts available at PHNSY are exhausted.  The existing ESAB plasma cutting machine is 13 years old, obsolete, difficult to operate, and repair parts are becoming difficult to obtain.  A CNC Plasma cutting machine is the most efficient machine to use for cutting thick metal plates (up to 6 inches thick) into the structural parts needed for the modifications, maintenance, and repairs for ships and submarines; therefore, the Structural Shop needs a reliable CNC plasma cutting machine to be fully functional and efficient.

[P40A / Reactor Access Enclosure (RAE) Support Tower]: This Project will procure a "Bridge/Towers" steel structure to be anchored to the floor of NNSY Dry Dock 1 and straddle a LOS ANGELES Class submarine.  The structural bridge (connecting the towers over the submarine) places the Reactor Access Enclosure (RAE), RAE Annex Enclosures and support equipment directly above the submarine.  The Bridge/Towers structure includes a coaming to fill the space between the hull and the bottom of the RAE; and it provides landing points for service equipment and personnel access to the Ship.

By executing this project, a support structure will exist that will allow the RAE to be mounted on board a LOS ANGELES Class Submarine without supporting the weight on the hull.  Currently the RAE is physically landed on the hull of the submarine.  Extensive hull welding is required to provide the proper structural support for the weight of the RAE on the hull.  In addition the installation of the RAE on the hull requires a greater area of the hull to have the special hull treatment (SHT) tiles removed then is necessary just to support the reactor access hull cut.  The cost and time for installing and then subsequently removing the RAE from the hull is significant.  As well as the replacement cost of the SHT tiles and the work necessary to remove and reinstall the extra area covered by the RAE.

[P40A / WINDOWS SERVER VIRTUALIZATION PHASE II]: This PSNS &amp; IMF project procures a suite of virtual infrastructure software and hardware to further capitalize on the use of virtualization to reduce IT costs while improving upon efficiencies.  The procurement includes 35 servers and support equipment that will replace 128 existing physical servers.  Existing devices were purchased in 2006 &amp; 2008 are well beyond the manufacturers end of life and operation capability and cybersecurity risks.  Key components of the project would include implementation of a virtual desktop infrastructure, configuration improvements, operations and monitoring improvements, and site recovery and contingency improvements.

[P40A / UNIX SERVERS]: This project replaces NNSY's existing Corporate System (UNIX) Servers with Oracle/Sun Microsystems T-7 series servers, along with the associated support equipment, and 12 HP DL-560 Linux Servers and associated support equipment.  The T3, T5140 and T5220 server platforms are part of the Corporate Server Datacenter Standard Architecture (CS/DSA) and have reached End of Life, and reach their End of Service support date in 2017, increasing cybersecurity risk. The servers are required to run all mission critical and essential systems. This new equipment provides a technology refresh of critical shipyard systems.  Replacement of this system is crucial to all NNSY overhaul and repair work, as well as work performed at the other Naval Shipyards, as NNSY centrally hosts selected Corporate Systems that are used by all shipyards. The ability to meet Cyber Security regulations and requirements is necessary to maintain accreditation and preclude disconnection.

[P40A / Switch and Router System]: This project refreshes existing switches and routers with compliant devices on the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) local Secure Network (SECNET) attached to the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program Network (NNPP Net).  The existing network devices have reached the manufacturer's End-of-Life/End-of-Support threshold and are cybersecurity risks. These devices are critical components of the IT infrastructure; loss of these devices due to failure will render SECNET inoperable.  This replacement is mandatory to retain vendor support.

These assets provide connectivity to critical Information Systems that are accessed by Nuclear Engineering Department, NRRO office, Business office, Engineering Supply, RADCON, SOMS, Project Teams and Administration.  Loss of these devices would cause SECNET to become unavailable to the work force and impede the productivity of the mission to the fleet.

[P40A / Tool Grinding Machine]: This project procures a Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Tool Grinding Machine for PSNS&amp;IMF's Toolmaker shop to produce federal stock system tooling for active nuclear systems, and sharpen drills and cutters.  The new machine will be a CNC five-axis tool grinder with a 37 HP or greater direct drive spindle capable of handling work pieces up to 88 pounds, 9.8 inch diameter and 14.5 inches long.

CNC tool grinding is an essential capability for Toolmakers to manufacture corporate tooling.  The existing CNC Tool Grinding Machine is 14 years old and experiencing increasing maintenance downtimes.  The machine has been down for maintenance at least 170 calendar days each year over the past three years and was down from July 2015 to July 2016.  The existing machine cannot meet current and future workload, nor can it reduce tooling backlog caused by machine breakdowns.  The machine does not have a coolant chiller which causes it to overheat and not function if it is worked for longer than one shift. This project increases Toolmaker capacity, productivity, and throughput required to fully support corporate tooling requirements thereby reducing Fleet wait times on Valve Seat Refurbishment kits.

PSNS&amp;IMF is the only supplier of Valves Seats Refurbishment kits for nuclear repair work.  Allowing this supply to dry up due to obsolete machinery impacts cost and safety of nuclear work throughout the Navy, including PSNS&amp;IMF Projects in San Diego, Everett, Bangor, Bremerton, Guam, and Yokosuka.  Replacing obsolete, inaccurate machinery also impacts PSNS nuclear and PSNS&amp;IMF nonnuclear Projects by making new process improvements more readily achievable.

            <proc:Description>Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) focused mission packages provide the operational commander with capabilities to perform littoral mine countermeasures (MCM) operations, a detect-to-engage capability to counter small boat threats, and a detect-to-engage capability to counter enemy submarines. A mission package (MP) is a combination of warfare mission modules (MM) with specialized crew, support equipment, and vehicles, including embarked manned helicopters and unmanned aircraft and maritime systems. Mission Modules are packaged in a modular fashion so that they can be quickly swapped in and out pier side on any LCS platform. The program has an inventory objective of 24 MCM mission packages, 24 surface warfare (SUW) mission packages, and 16 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission packages. Mission package procurement and delivery are aligned with the ship delivery schedule, mission area demand signal from the combatant commanders, and the retirement of legacy platforms. This means that 64 interchangeable mission packages will be available for use among the two seaframe variants of the LCS class to support global warfighting and peacetime presence requirements.

The LCS MMs program has developed two principal Seaframe-installed components to facilitate MP operation, the Mission Package Computing Environment (MPCE) and the Data Mission Payload. Additionally, each MP uses tailored Support Containers (SCs) whose designs are based upon an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) compliant base container. The initial SUW, MCM, and ASW MPs utilize the common equipment, infrastructure, and services to the maximum extent possible. Future MMs and MPs will utilize the common infrastructure and services as well. The base container is built to print with adjustable interior rails that can be reconfigured for a variety of applications.  The containers are built to a lightweight design and specialized to accommodate particular mission systems with maximum efficiency.

The Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) by itself or support containers by themselves do not comprise a Mission Package and are only deployable when part of a complete Mission Package. A Mission Package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment combined with all the mission systems that comprise the LCS MCM Mission Module (Line Item Number 1601), or combined with all the mission systems that comprise the LCS ASW Mission Module (Line Item Number 1602), or combined with all the mission systems that comprise the LCS SUW Mission Module (Line Item Number 1603).

            <proc:Description>The LCS Mine Countermeasures (MCM) mission package counters bottom, deep, shallow, surface, near surface, and tethered mines in the littoral without putting Sailors in the minefield. When the MCM mission package is embarked, LCS is capable of conducting detect-to-engage operations (hunting, sweeping, and neutralization) against shallow and deep-water sea mine threats. The MCM mission package provides these capabilities through the use of sensors and weapons deployed from an embarked MH-60S multi-mission helicopter and unmanned off-board vehicles. The embarked MH-60S employs the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures Module to provide rapid mine hunting and clearing using helicopter deployed systems. Future phases will add the Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module (CMRM) to allow detection of minefield patterns and obstacles from an embarked Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV), a surface influence sweep capability for high-speed influence minesweeping, and the KNIFEFISH to detect buried mines. When complete, the MCM mission package will provide full capability against floating, tethered, bottom, and buried mines. 

The MCM Mission Package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) and the full complement of mission systems that comprise the LCS MCM Mission Module (Line Item Number 1601). If mission systems are removed in any given Fiscal Year, the MCM Mission Package will be non-deployable until the mission systems are replaced in a subsequent Fiscal Year.

The number of LCS mission packages must not only keep pace with the number of ships, more are required to account for the mission packages that will be forward staged or unavailable due to periodic maintenance requirements.

Prior to FY13, MCM mission module systems were funded under OPN BLI 1600. 

The MCM package consists of the following systems: Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance &amp; Analysis (COBRA), Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), AQS-20A Minehunting Sonar, Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with Unmanned Surface Sweep System (USSS), KNIFEFISH and Support Containers. The individual systems are combined into five modules: Influence Mine Sweep Module, Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM) Module, Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module, and Unmanned Undersea Module.

[P5 / MC001 - UNMANNED INFLUENCE MINE SWEEP MODULE]: The Influence Mine Sweep Module provides an unmanned surface, long endurance bottom sweep capability to clear large areas of mines that may remain after mine-hunting operations are complete.

[P5 / MC003 - ORGANIC AIRBORNE MINE COUNTERMEASURES (OAMCM)]: The OAMCM Module provides the long-range, airborne capability to conduct mine hunting and clearing operations in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points, and the Amphibious Objective Area (AOA) quickly.

[P5 / AMNS Obsolence Upgrades]: The upgrades to previously procured AMNS units improve reliability and maintainability and correct deficiencies to allow the equipment to perform in accordance with current operational requirements and the current deployment configuration.

[P5 / ALMDS Obsolence Upgrades]: The upgrades to previously procured ALMDS units improve reliability and maintainability and correct deficiencies to allow the equipment to perform in accordance with current operational requirements and the current deployment configuration.

[P5 / MC004 - COASTAL MINE RECONNAISANCE MODULE]: The Coastal Mine Reconnaissance Module will detect mines in the surface zone and beach zone areas, providing the Joint Force Commander with the information needed to clear mines with non-LCS assets and allow military forces to safely and effectively storm the beaches.  This procurement line supports the LCS mine countermeasures mission package, providing deployable combat capability to the LCS MCM squadron.   Separately, in BLI 2624 Shallow Water Mine CM, COBRA systems are procured to provide initial and proficiency training to Navy aircrews (FY18 - 1 system; FY19 - 1; FY20 - 1; FY21 - 0; FY22 - 0).

[P5 / MC005 - BURIED MINEHUNTING MODULE]: The Buried Minehunting Module provides capability to detect and identify buried mines and mines in a cluttered ocean bottom environment.  This procurement line supports the LCS mine countermeasures mission package, providing deployable combat capability to the LCS MCM squadron.   Separately, in BLI 2622 Mine Sweeping Replacement, Knifefish systems are procured to provide initial and proficiency training to Navy crews (FY17 - 2 systems).

[P5 / MC006 - MCM SUPPORT EQUIPMENT]: Support equipment related to the individual modules.

[P5 / MC007 - MCM WHOLENESS SYSTEMS]: MCM Incremental Wholeness procures the individual mission systems required to bring previously acquired mission packages up to the incremental acquisition baseline.

[P5 / MC008 - MCM USV]: The Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) is integrated with the AQS-20 minehunting sonar.  It provides minehunting capability from the USV for LCS MCM Mission Packages.

[P5 / MC900 - CONSULTING SERVICES]: Provides program management support, engineering and technical support, studies, analysis and evaluation on mission module systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) mission package enables the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) to conduct detect-to-engage operations against modern submarines that pose a threat. Specific ASW capabilities include protecting forces in transit, protecting joint operating areas, and establishing ASW barriers. ASW Modules are developed to provide the warfighter capabilities that can be employed for ASW area search as well as high value unit escort missions.  Module components include a torpedo countermeasures system, a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) and a Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA). The Aviation Module provides airborne threat localization and engagement capability through an MH-60R helicopter with MK54 torpedoes and the ability to incorporate a Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

An ASW Mission Package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) and the full complement of mission systems that comprise the LCS ASW Mission Module (Line Item Number 1602). If mission systems are removed from the mission module in any given Fiscal Year, the ASW Mission Package will be non-deployable until the mission system is replaced in a subsequent Fiscal Year.

The number of LCS mission packages must not only keep pace with the number of ships, more are required to account for the mission packages that will be forward staged or unavailable due to periodic maintenance requirements.

            <proc:Description>The Surface Warfare (SUW) mission package increases firepower and offensive/defensive capabilities against large numbers of highly maneuverable, fast, small craft threats, giving LCS the ability to protect the sea lanes and move a force quickly through a choke point or other strategic waterway. With the SUW mission package embarked, LCS has enhanced detection and engagement capability against enemy small craft and similar littoral surface threats. The SUW (Phase 2) mission package is composed of two high velocity 30mm cannons to augment the ship's 57mm gun, embarked support aircraft (MH-60R helicopter with Hellfire missile) and the Maritime Security Module to support the embarkation of visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) teams. Six SUW mission packages have been delivered to the Fleet and one more is in production. Future SUW mission package phases include the addition of the MQ-8 Fire Scout Vertical Take-off and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) for the detection, identification, and classification of surface contacts, and a Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) to provide in-close and eventually an over-the-horizon engagement capability against surface threats.

A SUW mission package is deployable and capable of meeting its focused mission requirements on an LCS only when it includes the full complement of Common Mission Modules Equipment (Line Item Number 1600) and the full complement of mission systems that comprise the LCS SUW Mission Module (Line Item Number 1603). If mission systems are removed from the mission module in any given Fiscal Year, the SUW Mission Package will be non-deployable until the mission system is replaced in a subsequent Fiscal Year.

The number of LCS mission packages must not only keep pace with the number of ships, more are required to account for the mission packages that will be forward staged or unavailable due to periodic maintenance requirements.

            <proc:Description>This line provides funding for mandatory safety design changes, cyber security remediation actions, habitability modifications, and obsolescence and reliability resolution to maintain LCS operational availability and achieve the full 25-year service life. Funding covers planned CNO availabilities and includes two years of planning costs and long lead time materials (LLTM).

LN001 - Habitability Modification
Modifications to increase the permanent berths to 98 on the FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE variants for LCS 11 and LCS 13-20. The change addresses the following additional racks in berthing spaces, increased refrigeration (chill and freeze), increased dry provision stores, increased potable water capability, increased solid waste storage, and laundry capability, to support the increase in core crew size from 40 to 50 personnel. 

LN002 - LCS Ships Class Safety Design Changes
Safety modifications fund the redesigned stern ramp back-fit on five FREEDOM variant ships (LCS 11/13/15/17/19) to support 11M Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) operations and the installation of bridge wing for safe and effective operation of four INDEPENDENCE variant ships (LCS 14/16/18/20). This funding also supports installation of the Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) system on LCS 9-20. Note: Earlier ships changes were completed in prior years. Later ships will be corrected in-line. 

LN003 - LCS Modernization
Modernization funds back-fit and fact-of-life obsolescence changes on the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) to include:
- Mandatory Safety changes eliminate or reduce hazards to ship personnel or components. Safety considerations include human (includes human/system interfaces), toxic/hazardous materials and substances, testing, logistical support, weapons, and munitions/explosives. 
- Cyber Security changes protect data and information processed by installed networks and information systems. This includes hardware, software, and firmware that provide integrity, confidentiality, non-repudiation, identification and authentication, and availability of shipboard systems.
- Obsolescence changes are required to prevent systems from becoming incompatible with newer technologies, or to update systems.
- Reliability changes are key to the LCS reaching its full operational capabilities for the 25 year service life. System and structural reliability modifications will increase the LCS Ao and performance, while decreasing maintenance costs.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The AN/WLD-1(V)2 Remote Mine hunting System (RMS) was a mine reconnaissance system designed for the detection, classification, identification, and localization of bottom and moored mines in shallow and deep water.

As a result of the Department's Independent Review Team (IRT)the RMS program of record was cancelled. The FY 2016 budget supported the upgrade of the Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle (RMMV) from the v4.0 to the v6.0 baseline configuration.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: Propeller Blades &amp; PLMU

This SHIPALT replaces the existing Propeller Blades with higher efficiency blades and installs Propulsion Load Management Units (PLMU) that result in fuel savings and engine maintenance reduction as well as operational benefits.  The prototype for this SHIPALT was installed and proven aboard the LSD 44 under the DOD sponsored Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI).  Return On Investment (ROI) for the class is estimated at over $40M (after payback) and operational benefits include increased top speed, quicker response/deceleration, and elimination of existing system performance problems (i.e., low lube-oil pressure trip of main engines).  Only 9 LSDs will require this SHIPALT as part of the Midlife Program.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: Steering Control System

This SHIPALT replaces the analog Helm and Lee Helm Steering Consoles and equipment with an electronic, computerized Steering Control System (SCS) that integrates various navigation parameters, such as location (latitude, longitude) from GPS as well as pitch, roll, speed, heading, and wind.  SCS will be designed to integrate with Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems-Navy (ECDIS-N) digital nautical charts. The existing Bridge control system was designed in the late 1970s and is near the end of its useful service life.  Parts obsolescence is a rapidly growing and more costly problem on this maintenance intensive control system.  The IBS also provides significantly enhanced operational and monitoring capabilities as well as real-time Navigation data.  This system will reduce workload, provide significant readiness improvement, improve safety and provide cost avoidance.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>Models of Systems Affected: LPAC

This Ship Change replaces the Low-Pressure Air Compressors (LPAC) with modern, oil-free compressors.   Parts obsolescence is a rapidly growing and more costly problem on these maintenance intensive compressors.  This Ship Change provides Return On Investment (ROI) through improved reliability and maintainability of LPACs and reduced maintenance by elimination of oil contamination of pneumatic controls components (new compressors are oil-free).  In addition, the new compressors will provide significant readiness improvement through increased reliability of Vital, low-pressure air supply to Vital combat systems and the main propulsion controls.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Remarks>SCD 19102 (60 Ton) and SCD 19770 (20 Ton) Crane controls - These ship changes replaces the control system for the 60 and 20 Ton Cranes with a modern, electronic, computerized control system. The existing crane control system was designed in the late 1970s and is no longer logistically supported. Maintenance costs continue to be high due to the difficulty in obtaining repair parts and frequent failure of components. In addition, mission capability has been frequently degraded because the Deck Crane is required to support USMC amphibious assault landings and boat ops. The LSD-41 class crane control upgrades will include: replace obsolete and at-risk parts/subsystems (brakes, motors, safety devices), replace and upgrading electrical and control system (motor controllers, electrical circuits, panels, and switches), improve design of high failure items, upgrade operator control interface and preservation corrosion control requirements.</proc:Remarks>

                    <proc:Description>This SHIPALT replaces the generator on the Ship Service Diesel Generators (SSDG) with a higher wattage version and increased electric distribution capability for shore power, switchboard and load centers. This SHIPALT provides significant Return on Investment (ROI) through improved reliability and maintainability of electrical ship systems/equipment versus the obsolete and maintenance intensive equipment.  Also, additional electrical plant loads will improve efficient operation of the currently under-loaded SSDGs and contribute to the ROI through reduced maintenance costs for the SSDGs.</proc:Description>

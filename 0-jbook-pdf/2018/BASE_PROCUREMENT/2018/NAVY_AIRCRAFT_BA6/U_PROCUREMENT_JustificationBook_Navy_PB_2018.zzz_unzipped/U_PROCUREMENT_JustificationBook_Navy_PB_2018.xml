            <proc:Description>All aviation spares requirements are developed using accredited sparing models. Funding requirements for major avionics are calculated on an item-by-item basis where possible.  APN-6 is a "follower" account providing spares for end-items and modifications procured under APN Budget Activity (BA)'s 1-5 and 7, and follow program changes in end-item quantities, basing scenarios, and maintenance data.

The Initial spares category includes all repairables and consumables allowances to support the quantity and Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) of aircraft in new procurement, during Interim Contractor Support (ICS) to support the Repair of Repairables (ROR) prior to Material Support Date (MSD) and to support aircraft modifications.

Initial Spares supporting aircraft procured under APN BA-1 through BA-4 are based on the number of aircraft being procured, basing plans, flying hours, maintenance data, and a number of other data elements derived from the Weapon System Planning Documents and Aircraft Program Data File that are fed into the Readiness Based Sparing model and the Retail Inventory Model for Aviation model for the determination of spare engine requirements.  Spare engines and engine modules are procured under initial spares during the production of the aircraft and do not transition to Navy Working Capital Funds (NWCF).

The Initial Spares category funds the ROR via contractor support, prior to the MSD, when repairs are turned over to the organic depots.  

Modification spares follow the APN BA-5 Modification budget for all T/M/S supporting various Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and Operational Safety Improvement Programs (OSIPs).  

Spares for Aircraft Support Equipment and Facilities follow the APN BA-7 budget for all T/M/S providing spares for training devices and support equipment.  

Replenishment Spares provides initial sparing for 6K Cog containers (9710), Adversary (9711), Head Quarters (HQ) Replenishment (9712) for various classified programs and Executive Mission Helicopters, and Aviation Outfitting Account for Repairables (9713) and Consumables (9714) for initial sparing and range/depth increases. 

The Vendor Direct spares element of the budget is comprised of the Aviation Outfitting Account (AOA), which sources spares from Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF)/NWCF subsequent to MSD, as well as a limited number of Headquarters Replenishment Accounts for spares procured at Naval Air Systems Command headquarters to support Executive Mission helicopters, inter-service support requirements, and miscellaneous aircraft systems.  Successful execution of AOA and meeting Fleet requirements depends heavily on the synchronization between NWCF Buy-In and APN-6 Buy-Out requiring stability of funding levels for both accounts.  AOA fills Aviation and Shore Consolidated Allowances (AVCAL/SHORCAL).  AVCALs support carriers and L-decks conducting deployed operations.  

APN-6 funding for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will procure the Navy's proportional share of pooled aircraft spares and repair parts, to include spare engines and engine modules.  Additionally, APN-6 funds will procure initial spares and repair parts necessary to outfit organic and commercial depot repair activities in satisfaction of the interim support arrangements made to achieve key sustainment milestones in the JSF program.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Aviation sparing supports the Chief of Naval Operations' (CNO's) strategy of achieving a 2+3 carriers' posture by 2020. This includes filling Aviation and Shore Consolidated Allowances (AVCAL/SHORCAL) requirements enabling carriers/L-Decks to conduct deployed operations. Initial contractor spares and engine spares are a major cost driver in FY18 due to new Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) being introduced and procured in FY18.  To field new aircraft, sparing supports the stand-up of new basing plans and additional support packages.  The PB18 Aviation Spares and Repair Parts budget further supports the Secretary of Defense's strategy to improve warfighting readiness by addressing urgent warfighting readiness shortfalls.

(1) Initial Spares:
FY2018  initial spares funding is required for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) (0152) and JSF Carrier Variant (CV) (0147) to support Initial Operational Capability; meet parts availability, resupply response times, and maintenance requirements; and continue progressing to Full Operational Capability. The funding will procure Afloat Spares Packages, Deployment Spares Packages, Base Spares Packages, and the Navy and Marine Corps share of the JSF Global Spares Pool (GSP). The GSP is a foundational tenet of this joint program, whereby the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and eight International countries share the cost of spares, eliminating need for individual entities to procure full depth and range of spares. These initial spares and repair parts are critical to establishing depot maintenance capability and meeting sustainment milestones for all partners.

FY2018  initial spares funding also includes required support of the following aircraft platforms:
CH-53K (0158) - spares associated with Low Rate Initial Procurement (LRIP) and engines.
CMV-22 (0164) - spares for unique systems on Navy variant. Increase from FY2017 is due to start of production for CMV-22.
P-8 (0193) - spares for Special Mission Pod Deployment System mechanism and one engine.
E-2D AHE (0195) - spare engines, contractor spares, and peculiar support equipment requirements.
KC-130J (0416) - spare engine and propeller requirements.
MQ-4C TRITON (0442) - spares associated with LRIP.
MQ-8 UAV (0443) - spares to support the quantity of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) Ships deployed with MQ-8 and sparing decision to carry a spare engine on each LCS, resulting in an increase.

FY2018 funding is required for Repair of Repairables (ROR) (9401). ROR increases from FY2017 for MQ-4 TRITON, F/A-18E/F Infrared Search and Track (IRST), Common Avionics, and Consolidated Automated Support Systems (CASS).

FY2018 funding is required for Spares for Modification (9504) requirements which are driven by F/A-18 Operational Safety Improvement Programs for IRST, Active Electronically Scanned Array, Manned Reconnaissance modifications for EP-3, Special Aircraft, and P-8, Service Life Monitoring Program, and the addition of modifications for MQ-8.  

FY2018 funding is required for Aircraft Support Equipment and Facilities, providing initial spares for Training Devices (9705), Common Support Equipment (CSE) (9707), CASS (9708), and Tactical Combat Training System (TCTS) (9709). These accounts are critical and tied directly to T/M/S enabling mission success by training pilots and maintainers and ensuring maintenance and planeside support of the aircraft.  The increase in CSE is due to introduction of new aircraft.  The increase in CASS is driven by the new eCASS system.

(2) Replenishment:
FY2018 funding is required for replenishment of the Aviation Outfitting Account  (AOA) (Repairable)/Aviation Consumable Account (ACA)(9713/9714) spares. The AOA Repairable account is integral in that it includes sustainment requirements that maintain current operational and wartime readiness for legacy systems such as F/A-18, AV-8B, EA-6B, H-1, MH-53E, MV-22, Common Avionics and Special Programs. Specifically, Aviation Outfitting procures critical spare parts to fill AVCAL and SHORCAL requirements in support of the CNO's strategy of achieving 2+3 carrier's posture by FY2020. AOA/ACA accounts fund aviation material spares that will support 116 projected aircraft deliveries (of at least 8 T/M/S) in/or about FY2018, current and/or deferred buy-outs of repairable and consumable spares from the Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF), and Weapon System Planning Document (WSPD) updates that include changes in basing scenarios and Concept of Operations. 

AOA Repairables funds increased in FY2018 in order to improve aviation operational readiness across the Fleet.  The P-8 Outfitting also increased due to revised WSPD operational (basing) requirements. MH-60 Outfitting includes deferrals and funding of requirements for Automatic Radar Detection and Discrimination, KU Band, Operator Sensor Interface and Enhanced Software Configuration Air Data Unit that would have otherwise been funded during the interim phase. 

Some post-MSD systems yield new spares requirements that are fulfilled through Outfitting.

In FY2018, ACA (consumables) supports carriers and L-decks as well as Naval Air Station aviation allowance growth and repair efforts supporting AOA assets.

FY2018 funding is required for Spares for 6K Cog (9710), Adversary (9711), and Head Quarters (HQ) Replenishment (9712) requirements. HQ Replenishment includes Executive Helicopter Mission, Project Beartrap, Direct Support Squadron, and Manned Reconnaissance. Due to the nature of Adversary and HQ Replenishment programs, initial spares requirements are supported for the life of the program by APN-6 funding and are not transferred to the Navy Supply System for support. Spares for 6K Cog have increased from FY2017 due to the shortfall of shipping containers in the fleet that are integral in getting high dollar parts (i.e. everything from small computer components to engines) shipped safely from depot to fleet and back.

OCO: 
FY18 OCO of $10.6M for Modification spares supports Manned Reconnaissance Systems modifications for EP-3, Special Project Aircraft, P-8 Quick Reaction Change (QRC), and Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasures (DAIRCM) AN/AAQ-45 Aircraft Survivability Equipment for MH-60S, AH-1Z, and UH-1Y Marine Expeditionary Unit aircraft in support of a Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement.  Specific locations of forward deployed assets are classified.

FY18 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) of $8.250M for HQ Replenishment spares supports EP-3E and Special Project Aircraft Manned Reconnaissance Systems which are in direct support of OCO Theater Operations. Platforms have been deployed continuously in support of all OCO Theater Operations since 2001. Specific locations of forward deployed assets are classified.  Spares requirements are due to the austere OCO environments, increased systems inventory, and increased flight hours.</proc:Justification>

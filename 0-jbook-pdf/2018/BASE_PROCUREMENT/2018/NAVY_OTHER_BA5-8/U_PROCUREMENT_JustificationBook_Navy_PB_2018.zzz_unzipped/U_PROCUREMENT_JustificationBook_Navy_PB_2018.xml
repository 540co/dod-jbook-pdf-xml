            <proc:Description>This budget line item funds procurement of passenger-carrying vehicles consisting of buses, automobiles, ambulances, and various utility and carryall trucks up to 9200 lbs. Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). These vehicles are utilized by Naval operating forces and shore activities for essential transportation of personnel in the execution of official Navy business. Funding in this line also supports the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC).

Buses procured are 20 to 60 passenger school buses, shuttle buses, intercity buses, and ambulance buses, which provide the most cost effective means to transport groups of people between various locations. Buses are used to transport sailors/airmen and reserve personnel for flight/ship logistic related assignments, mandatory military training and exercises, and for transportation of personnel between administrative areas, ships/airfields, and industrial areas on a daily basis (both scheduled and intermittent).

Automobiles are used to transport small groups of personnel, on and off base, for various work related activities. Law enforcement automobiles provide essential transportation services to insure optimum responsiveness in support of DOD intelligence and base security missions. They are used in Naval intelligence, investigative and surveillance operations, security patrols, and other law enforcement activities.

Ambulances are used by the Medical Corps at Navy hospitals, clinics, and by Naval Expeditionary Medical Command Units. Modular ambulances are used for emergency transport of personnel where emergency medical services are provided in route. Field ambulances provide the same emergency service, but are four-wheel drive to access remote sites in support of field units. Patient transport ambulances are used for transporting stabilized patients to specialized care/other medical facilities. Ambulance conversion buses are used to move mixed loads of ambulatory and/or stretcher-borne patients.

Maintenance/utility trucks are utilized to transport tools, supplies, materials, and equipment necessary for maintenance personnel performing facility maintenance at shore facilities. Carryalls are used for transporting sailors, flight crews, maintenance, and civilian personnel to work sites or for other mission related activities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds requested in FY 2018 will provide for recapitalization requirements to support fielding a fleet of equipment within useful life expectancy.

            <proc:Description>This budget line item procures various sizes of utility and cargo trucks of commercial design. 

Cargo pickup trucks are used to transport personnel and equipment in support of fleet operations where such mobility is necessary to support the mission. The maintenance/utility trucks are used to transport tools/materials necessary for maintenance personnel performing facility maintenance. Panel and multi-stop trucks are used primarily for the movement of material/equipment requiring protection in an enclosed van-type body and freight trucks are used to move palletized material from warehouses to users. Funding is also included in this line for specialized operations such as the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), and other mission specific equipment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds requested in FY 2018 will provide for recapitalization requirements to support fielding a fleet of equipment within useful life expectancy.  

FY 2017 decrease in General Purpose Trucks OPN by $0.084M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

OCO: 
Included in this request is FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa (OEF-H) in the amount of $0.390M for Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti. Funds requested are for replacement of general purpose trucks at a core installation that provides key logistics services supporting ship and aircraft movements and command and control services for the warfighter in support of Overseas Contingency Operations. The life expectancy of the cargo trucks being replaced is 6-7 years and the average age is 16 years. Replacing inventory will minimize mission impact by moving towards equipment standardization of parts-stocking, minimize maintenance downtime waiting on parts from the states, and eliminate the need for costly commercial leasing to meet mission requirements.

Cargo Trucks, QTY=14, $0.390M

Included in this request is FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the European Resource Initiative in the amount of $0.106M. The request supports Naval Expeditionary Combat Command's participation and support of additional bilateral and multilateral exercises and training with allies and partners; in support of Central and Eastern Europe.

            <proc:Description>In FY18, $13.536M was transferred from LI 7025 Supply Equipment for improved funds management by enabling NAVFAC to directly procure Expeditionary Material Handling Equipment (ExMHE) vice NAVSUP.

This budget line item funds procurement of equipment used for a variety of construction, maintenance, and repair operations. This equipment is used by the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command, Naval Beach Group, Maritime Prepositioning Force, and other Special Operating Units, in support of advance bases and camp sites.

Earth Moving Equipment includes equipment such as ditching machines, excavators, graders, wheeled and tracked loaders, rollers, compactors, scrapers, off-highway dump trucks, crawler tractors, and industrial tractors. This equipment constitutes the backbone of the Naval Construction Force (NCF) in meeting their advanced base construction mission.  Dependable earth moving equipment in the fleet and shore inventories is required for the building and renovation of runways and roads, demolition activities at old building sites, and underground utilities excavation.

Miscellaneous Construction Equipment includes four major categories of construction equipment:

-General mix, batch, concrete and asphalt working equipment consists of equipment such as portable concrete mixers, rock crushers, asphalt and water distributors, aggregate spreaders, and asphalt and rubberized compound heating kettles which are used to provide aggregate materials for asphalt mixing plants and concrete batching plants. This equipment is used by the NCF to provide advance base and forward port facility construction and runway, taxi apron, and work area paving projects.

-Air compressors and drilling operations equipment consists of portable air compressors of various sizes and capacities for construction and maintenance projects; rock drills for quarry production, pile hammers and extractors for construction, repair, and disassembly of causeways, docks, piers, and wharves; earth augers to support electrical distribution and communications systems; well drilling machines to supply water in support of Marine Corps contingencies and construction battalions at camp sites and advance bases.

-Floodlights and generators consists of portable floodlight trailers (with 6kW generators) which are used by the NCF to provide light for around-the-clock construction efforts and generators used as portable power to support power tools, runway lighting, and backup systems for electrical power distribution. This equipment is part of the DOD Mobile Electric Power Program (PM-MEP) which provides reliable standardized generators for all DOD components.

Other miscellaneous maintenance equipment consists of welders, decontamination apparatus, machine shop trailers and shredders. This equipment is used for a variety of maintenance, repair and construction operations and for purification and decontamination of personnel and equipment.

Cranes (Weight Handling Equipment) includes truck or wheel-mounted cranes, straddle lifts, and crawler cranes. Truck mounted cranes have either lattice or hydraulic booms and range in size from 25 to 150 tons. Wheel-mounted cranes have hydraulic booms and range in size from 8 to 90 tons. Crawler cranes are used primarily for drag line and clam shell operations on terrain inaccessible with truck or wheel-mounted cranes. Amphibious Construction Battalions (PHIBCBs) use wheel-mounted hydraulic cranes and crawler cranes in over-the-beach operations and on elevated causeways (ELCAS).

This program also funds the procurement of Expeditionary Material Handling Equipment (ExMHE) to satisfy operational requirements and replaces overaged non-repairable equipment used in material handling operations at world-wide Navy activities.  Expeditionary MHE is used to equip and sustain expeditionary forces to execute combat, combat support, and combat service support missions.  Expeditionary MHE belongs to expeditionary activities that are either forward deployed units or whose mission is in direct support of those units. The funds requested in FY18 will provide for, but not limited to: Truck Forklift 5000 LB, TRFK Forklift RT, 11k, EXT Boom, Truck Forklift 12,000  LB Rough Terrain, Truck Forklift t25,000  LBCAP PRT DED W/Top Handler Forklift 53k</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The increase in funds requested for FY18 will provide for:
- Airfield Damage Repair technology - Replace/update various equipment to close the gap on historical airfield repair technologies still in use today.  Equipment includes but is not limited to:  Asphalt recyclers, Front end Loaders, Backhoes, etc.
- Cold Form Steel Systems - A method of building that is used commercially and is now planned for military use.  This system will increase life safety due to less reliance on convoys to transport building materials through operational environments to operational building sites.
- Investment in generators which are more fuel efficient than the current deployed assets, which in turn also lessen the burden on convoys for fuel.
- Various Earthmoving equipment which has reached or surpassed its useful life.
- Miscellaneous Construction equipment in need of recapitalization as it has reached or surpassed its useful life.

Investment in these areas had been deferred due to sequestration and other fiscal constraints which yields the increase in funding from FY17 to FY18.

In addition, $13.536M was transferred from LI 7025 Supply Equipment into this line for improved funds management by enabling NAVFAC to directly procure Expeditionary Material Handling Equipment (ExMHE) vice NAVSUP.

FY 2017 decrease in Construction &amp; Maint Equip OPN by $0.779M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item funds procurement of aircraft fire/rescue trucks and structural/brush fire trucks. 

The aircraft fire/rescue trucks are used at Naval Air Stations for combating aircraft fires and rescue of aircraft crews. The trucks range in size from a small 11,000 pound Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) pickup with utility body and twin engine fire fighting unit to the 68,000 pound GVWR crash truck which carries 3,000 gallons of water and 200 gallons of AFFF (foam). The structural/brush fire trucks are used at Naval activities in the same manner as municipal fire trucks in fighting structural and grass fires.

The Navy's investment in ships, aircraft, facilities, personnel and equipment mandates having adequate fire protection. The requested funds are needed to comply with current National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, sustain the Navy Firefighting Fleet and maintain an effective Firefighting Fleet Modernization Program consistent with findings identified in the DoD IG Report: D-2003-121 DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program.  The Firefighting Fleet requires annual investments to ensure emergency response vehicles are within specified service life for safety, technological improvements, and maintenance sustainability.  Highly reliable trucks are required as the emergency vehicles are key to success.  Some older crash response trucks do not meet roll safety criteria, and require continued replacement to ensure safe working limits. As firefighter staffing is reduced and the all-hazards emergency response mission expands, the Navy's firefighting apparatus must evolve to provide additional capabilities for emergency medical services, rescue, confined space, hazardous materials, etc.  The ability to save lives and protect property is essential in supporting the Navy's mission. The role of these trucks is to provide the Navy's response to structural fire emergencies, aircraft rescue fire fighting crashes, emergency medical services incidents, all hazards public safety, and emergency response to terrorism incidents, and weapons of mass destruction.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds requested in FY 2018 will provide for recapitalization requirements to support fielding a fleet of equipment within useful life expectancy.

FY 2017 decrease in Fire Fighting Equipment OPN by $0.572M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

OCO: 
Included in this request is FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Operation Freedom's Sentinel in the amount of $.572M for Isa Air Base, Bahrain and for Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa (OEF-H) in the amount of $1.732M for Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti. 

Funds requested are for replacement fire fighting vehicles (beyond serviceable life) at core installations that provide key logistics services supporting ship and aircraft movements and command and control services for the warfighter in support of Overseas Contingency Operations. The life expectancy of fire fighting equipment used in OCO locations is 10 years given the harsh expeditionary type conditions, reduced maintenance support and the lack of proper fire station facilities. The trucks being replaced have met their life expectancy. 

Isa Air Force Base:
Truck A/C Crash Fire Rescue 1500 GAL, QTY=1, $0.572M

Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti:
Truck Water Tanker, QTY=1, $0.630M
Truck Fire Fighting Structural Pumper, QTY=1, $0.381M
Truck A/C Crash Fire Rescue 3000 GAL, QTY=1, $0.721M</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item funds procurement of light and medium duty tactical equipment used primarily by the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF), Naval Beach Group (NBG), and other special operating units. This line also includes Force Protection requirements funding for Tactical Vehicles.

Light duty tactical vehicles (HMMWVs/LSSVs/JLTVs) are used by NECC, MPF, NBG, and special operating units for the movement of personnel and equipment. Medium tactical(MTVR/MRAPs) trucks are required for rapid deployment of containerized table of allowance material and have air transport, water fording, and enhanced combat mobility capability. Medium tactical cargo trucks are used for material/equipment movement and delivery. Medium tactical dump trucks are used to support combat construction of airfields, landing zones, road battle damage repair and rapid runway repair.  

Force Protection funds are used to modify both light and medium tactical vehicles with the necessary upgrades to carry out both primary and secondary missions in a combat environment.  Planned modifications include making baseline MTVR models Ready To Accept Armor (RTAA) and integrating vehicles with installations kits for Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipment and  Counter RCIED (Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device) Electronic Warfare systems. This program includes funds for the procurement of HMMWVs to guard and protect the TRIDENT II (D5) missile while the missile is in storage, being handled, or in a movement convoy to and from the waterfront at the Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) in Kings Bay, GA and the Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (SWFPAC) in Bangor, WA. Equipment is used in support of Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) mission of securing the Limited Area and provides for security vehicles to replace existing (aging) vehicles used in roving patrols of the Limited Area and to support TRIDENT II (D5) missile movement convoys.

            <proc:Justification>The funds requested in FY18 will provide for, but not limited to:

- Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) for US Navy SEAL combat operations in forward deployed contingency locations.  These materiel assets support the Seals core mission requirements and are essential to the readiness and battlefield effectiveness of these special forces in winning the current fight against ISIS and other extremist elements.
  
- LSSVs which have surpassed their life expectancy and will be deployed to the Expeditionary Medical Forces. LSSV's are at end of service life and are required to be recapitalized in FY18 to meet both Expeditionary Medical rotation schedule and Combat Command mission requirements.  The Expeditionary Medical Facility (EMF) Tables of Allowance are forward deployed and only be accessed once every 5 years. The LSSV procurements are aligned to meet the rotation of the EMF rotation schedule.

Force Protection:

Ready to Accept Armor (RTAA):  Increase in funding is for the efforts involved in providing RTAA modifications to existing Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements (MTVR's), which will be used in support of the EOD Expeditionary Mine Counter Measures (Ex-MCM) mission.  C4ISR:  Increase in funding will provide for integration of installation kits for C4ISR and CREW equipment into multiple tactical vehicle platforms. Outfitting of this gear is a lesson learned from OIF/OEF when the Expeditionary Forces lacked means to communicate across vehicles within the same convoy, capability to identify friendly forces, and to identify and defeat Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).  Lacking these capabilities created unnecessary life-safety risks.  This program was delayed due to sequestration and other funding constraints yielding the increase in FY18.

FY 2017 decrease in Tactical Vehicles OPN by $0.629M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

OCO: 
Included in this request is FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan in the amount of $2.336M for installation of EGRESS ECP kits, life safety issues from lessons learned from OIF/OEF.  The Egress ECP Kits were procured in FY14 with OCO and were long lead items.  Items are scheduled for delivery starting June of 2017.The MRAP ECPs for Egress and Seat Survivability Upgrades were designed specifically to increase MRAP survivor rates in today's urban warfare environment of IEDs.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line item funds the procurement of equipment to support Navy-Marine Corps amphibious operations, Logistics Over the Shore, and Joint Logistics Over the Shore operations. This provides the ability to execute the ship to shore transfer of vehicles, dry cargo, and liquid cargo, delivered over bare beaches, as well as through improved and semi-improved port facilities. 

This program is a critical component that enables the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) concept. It is designed and intended to interface with MPF vessels during initial combat operations (Assault Echelon and immediate sustainment of the AE force) and then with Roll-On/Roll-Off, container, dry cargo, and liquid cargo ships to provide war material to the Assault Follow-On Echelon (AFOE). The equipment is employed by the Naval Support Element (Naval Beach Groups) and the Amphibious Ready Group-Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG/MEU) team. 

The Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) consists of Causeway Ferries (CF), Warping Tugs (WT), a Roll-on/Roll-off Discharge Facility (RRDF), and a Floating Causeway (FC) pier. All of these systems work in concert to deliver critical war material from MPF and AFOE ships, across a bare beach, and into the hands of warfighters. The INLS achieved IOC in FY06 and FOC in FY11, requiring sustainment efforts to maintain availability for operation in the face of aging components and technical obsolescence of the various control systems. The Sealift Support Program Office is providing lifecyle support to the INLS program as well as other specialized equipment and vehicles that directly participate in and contribute to amphibious operations. Specific to this lifecycle support mission, an improvement is being made to the waterjet system to extend the lifespan of critical components that otherwise would render the craft non-mission capable if the component were to fail, necessitating a significant and time-consuming depot-level repair.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The budget requests funds for INLS Waterjet modifications that upgrade primary propulsion components that are failing at an unacceptable rate. The INLS Waterjet modification will increase mean time between overhauls from 12 months to 60 months and extend the life of the craft. 

The increase of these upgrades from FY17 to FY18 is critical to meet the delivery deadlines of ready-to-deploy craft for loading onto the MPF ships as part of the MPF Maintenance Cycle (MMC).  

Failure to meet this timeline will result in the INLS craft not receiving this critical upgrade for up to three additional years, leading to significantly increased risk to the ability to execute tasking in support of COCOMs.

FY 2017 decrease in Amphibious Equipment OPN by $0.324M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Navy Ashore Pollution Control Equipment program funds hazardous substance spill containment and recovery systems.

Funding requirements for the Navy's oil spill program include procurement of oil spill containment booms and related deployment equipment. After initial containment with boom, shore activities can efficiently collect spilled oil with vacuum trucks.  This equipment will enable the Navy to meet the requirements established by the EPA in the National Contingency Plan which requires rapid and effective response to oil spills. The revised National Spill Contingency Plan mandates that the DOD and the Navy assume responsibility for their own oil and hazardous substance spills. These broad responsibilities require the Navy to maintain sufficient spill response equipment for the Navy activities worldwide, such as oil spill containment systems and recovery systems. The severe oil spills in Alaska, California and the Gulf of Mexico have increased the public's sensitivity to releases of oil into the environment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Additional procurement of shore based equipment in FY18 is required to improve mission readiness at Naval Installations. Without additional procurement, there is increased maintenance costs to extend equipment service life and readiness is impacted during increased maintenance cycle times.

FY 2017 decrease in Pollution Control Equipment OPN by $0.098M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES/EQUIPMENT
This program includes special purpose vehicles and trailers of commercial design which support the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), shore activities, and Naval Special Warfare. Included are tank trucks used to transport fuel to construction equipment at remote locations, waste disposal trucks used to transport waste oil/water, overhead maintenance trucks with insulated buckets and pole and line trucks used for repair/replacement of power systems, wreckers used in vehicle recovery/towing, field servicing vehicles used for on-site preventive maintenance of construction equipment in the field, and ammunition handling trucks used in loading/unloading and transporting munitions. Truck tractors and trailers required by the active operating forces in the logistics support of the fleet are also included in this program. Representative types and uses include van and stake bed semi-trailers to support loading/unloading of ships and aircraft and movement of materials and equipment for fleet operations, lowbed semitrailers for transport of construction equipment, tank trailers for transport and dispensing of water, fuel, and hazardous liquids, and semi-trailers transport of materials.

This program includes funds for the procurement of Bearcats, used on paved or improved roads, to guard and protect the TRIDENT II (D5) missile while the missile is in storage, being handled, or in a movement convoy to and from the waterfront at the Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT) in Kings Bay, GA and the Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (SWFPAC) in Bangor, WA. Equipment is used in support of Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) mission of securing the Limited Area and provides for security vehicles to replace existing (aging) vehicles used in roving patrols of the Limited Area and to support TRIDENT II (D5) missile movement convoys.

COMBAT CONSTRUCTION SUPPORT EQUIPMENT
The equipment included in this program is used by the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), Naval Beach Group (NBG), and Naval Special Warfare to provide responsive military construction support to the Navy, Marine Corps, and other forces during military operations, construction of base facilities, and in the conduct of limited defensive operations. These facilities and equipment are vital for maintaining the integrity and sustainability of these units during contingency and wartime operations. Equipment items include containers, required for prepacking and securing on-site storage of expensive equipment to expedite mobilization, fuel storage tanks required for on-site storage of fuel, water purification units required for camp water treatment systems, water storage tanks (collapsible fabric) required for water treatment, storage and distribution systems, power distribution panelboards required for camp electrical distribution systems, and tension fabric structures required for expeditionary facilities to provide equipment maintenance and company shops, berthing, laundry, and combat operations centers. 

OCEAN CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT
Ocean Construction Equipment are those specialized equipment and facilities components used primarily by the Naval Construction Force (NCF) to perform site selection, construction, inspection, maintenance, repair and removal of fleet and other Navy fixed underwater and ocean facilities, and in support of shore-based hyperbarics. Some equipment is centrally procured under this line as initial outfitting for the Underwater Construction Teams' (UCT) Tables of Allowance (TOA). Most of the equipment is for the Ocean Construction Equipment Inventory (OCEI). It is centrally procured and maintained by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command in a controlled inventory to ensure the NCF response to fleet needs is both timely and adequate. Utilization of funds from this program sustains the Naval Construction Force (NCF) capability to meet fleet requirements for ocean facility site survey, construction, inspection, repair, and removal, resulting in the ability of the fleet to retain its readiness through utilization of its underwater facilities. The funds requested in FY 2018 will be used to replace existing equipment kits and systems which are well beyond their useful and maintainable lives. In many instances, these replacements will result in slightly improved or modified capabilities.

MOBILE UTILITIES SUPPORT EQUIPMENT (MUSE)
Equipment in this program consists of electric power generation plants, electric substations, and electric switch gear.  MUSE provides short-term support for fleet and shore utility requirements resulting from equipment failures, changes in planning and programming, temporary replacement of utilities equipment which is out of service, ship support and testing, expeditionary military operations, and utilities outages resulting from natural disaster. Operations supported are submarine testing, ships' repair, retrofit and nuclear refueling, cold iron applications, serious utility system deficiencies, MILCON delay, and advanced base requirements.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The funds requested in FY 2018 will provide for requirements to support fielding a fleet of equipment within useful life expectancy, this includes replacement of equipment which has exceeded its useful life or new approved equipment requirements necessary to support the various expeditionary missions. Focus for expeditionary facilities is the procurement and fielding of Command and Control tent camp equipment and berthing.  These engineered capabilities integrate joint standardization board (JSB) approved equipment to ensure interoperability, energy enhancements and commonality across the Navy and DOD. These materiel assets support Naval Special Warfare (NSW) core mission requirements and are essential to the readiness and battlefield effectiveness of NSW in winning the current fight against ISIS and other extremist elements. In order to take the fight to the enemy and deny them the use of remote safe havens, NSW must be prepared to construct and operate from austere, expeditionary camps in the most remote corners of the globe.

FY18 funds for Ocean Construction Equipment will provide for the planned incorporation of the new technology of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) into the capability of the UCTs.  These AUVs will allow the Underwater Construction Teams (UCTs) to perform their underwater survey and data gathering missions in dangerous forward areas in a much safer way.  UCT personnel can program the AUV to go to a certain underwater location, collect the data that has been requested by the mission commander, and return with the data.  This reduces the exposure of the UCT personnel to hostile actions.

MUSE funds requested in FY 2018 will be utilized to procure one One-Megawatt (1-MW) mobile electric power generation plant.  

Capabilities presented on the P40-A consist of many components. Variation in components being procured in a given fiscal year will yield fluctuation in the unit costs.

FY 2017 decrease in Items under $5 million OPN by $0.520M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

The FY 2017 funding request was also reduced by $0.161M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Starting FY17, line items 7015 Materials Handling Equipment and 7050 Other Supply Support Equipment has been combined into line item 7025, Supply Equipment. 

MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE): This program funds the procurement of Material Handling Equipment to satisfy operational requirements and replaces overaged non-repairable equipment used in material handling operations at world-wide Navy activities.  Major using activities include ships, naval magazines, air stations, weapon stations, and overseas support activities such as Sigonella and Sasebo. The MHE program also funds General Fund activities to meet known operational requirements for replacement of equipment which has exceeded its economic life. Overaged equipment is not cost effective to maintain for continued operation, and repair parts are difficult to obtain. Replacement of overaged equipment with new and more efficient models will reduce excessive costs attributed to repair/overhaul, downtime and maintenance. New equipment will enhance productivity and enable stations to meet handling and logistics requirements in an efficient and effective manner.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY16 increase includes procurement of three 25K aircraft loader/unloaders ($2.6M) critical to logistics operations at naval installations. Additionally, procurement of 18 Millennia Military Vehicle (MMVs) is critical to the success of expeditionary operations carried out by the Naval Construction Force ($2.9M). MMVs are armored which adds weight to the vehicles and results in additional wear. Navy-wide there are at least 4,489 pieces of Material Handling Equipment which will be more than 10 years old in 2016. This quantity includes gas-powered, diesel-powered and electric-powered forklifts and tow tractors that are critical to the operations of shore Navy Shore activities ($2.583M). The normal life expectancy for Materials Handling Equipment is 10 years. Navy must recapitalize the MHE inventory to support the Warfighter.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Note: Efforts within this budget line were consolidated from LIs 7015 and 7050 in FY16 and prior. Starting in FY17, the funding for Expeditionary Material Handling Equipment requirements transferred to Naval Facilities Engineering Command. 

MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE): This program funds the procurement of Material Handling Equipment to satisfy operational requirements and replaces overaged non-repairable equipment used in material handling operations at world-wide Navy activities.  Major using activities include ships, naval magazines, air stations, weapon stations, and overseas support activities such as Sigonella and Sasebo. The MHE program also funds General Fund activities to meet known operational requirements for replacement of equipment which has exceeded its economic life. Overaged equipment is not cost effective to maintain for continued operation, and repair parts are difficult to obtain. Replacement of overaged equipment with new and more efficient models will reduce excessive costs attributed to repair/overhaul, downtime and maintenance. New equipment will enhance productivity and enable stations to meet handling and logistics requirements in an efficient and effective manner.

NAVY CASH PROGRAM: This program funds the procurement of the Navy Cash system. Navy Cash was developed to improve business processes, create workload efficiencies, and enhance the quality of life for Sailors and Marines on board ship. It enhances the efficiencies and security of automated pay delivery and safekeeping deposit provided by the ATMs-at-Sea system that Navy Cash replaced. Everyone on a ship receives a Navy Cash or Marine Cash card, a branded debit card that looks like a typical debit or check card. It utilizes a pre-paid debit model to provide for a cashless shipboard environment for all retail and other personal financial transactions and helps to reduce the workload for the Disbursing Office and retail locations throughout the ship. This affords more time for core functions and thereby increases readiness. It also improves shipboard business practices by automating and significantly reducing the handling of bills, coins, personal checks, and money orders, automating back-end financial processes and minimizing error-prone cash transactions while it reduces the workload associated with cash management and improves the efficiency and accuracy of fiscal accountability. This overall reduction in the need for cash decreases the costs associated with maintaining large amounts of cash in the safes of ships for the six or more months of deployment.

The current Navy Cash environment is dependent on a specific hardware and software environment that is costly to maintain and reaching end-of-life on key operating components.  Navy Cash 2.0/Europay, Mastercard, Visa (EMV) is the next logical progression in cashless operations that will enhance the current Navy Cash solution by operating in a virtual environment such as the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services and aligns with Navy directives for virtualization of Fleet-wide systems.  Navy Cash 2.0/EMV also builds on the technical expertise gained with remote updates to ship systems, and enhances this functionality to introduce full automation of application patching processes for quicker deployment of security fixes to the Fleet. Cost savings will be a direct result of reduced maintenance required for hardware and software support.  Deployment is anticipated to begin in FY19.

The Navy Cash program currently uses a smart card solution containing a proprietary ePurse that carries a higher card production and maintenance cost.  Benefits and substantial savings can be achieved by replacing the ePurse with EMV a global standard for credit and debit payment cards based on chip card technology.  EMV was recently mandated by Executive Order 13681, improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions (EMV Chip &amp; PIN).  EMV chip-based payment cards, also known as smart cards, contain an embedded microprocessor, a type of small computer. The microprocessor chip contains the information needed to use the card for payment, and is protected by various security features. Chip cards are a more secure alternative to traditional magnetic stripe payment cards.

Navy Cash Installation Program:
2017 19 Installations (10 Small / 5 Med / 2 Large /  2 CVN) 
2018 32 Installations (21 Small / 6 Med / 3 Large / 2 CVN) 
2019 31 Installations (21 Small / 6 Med / 2 Large /  2 CVN) 
2020 28 Installations (21 Small / 4 Med / 2 Large /  1 CVN) 
2021 24 Installations (14 Small / 6 Med / 2 Large /  2 CVN) 
2022 12 Installations (7 Small / 2 Med / 1 Large /  2 CVN) 

AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT): The Department of Defense (DoD) promulgated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy on 30 July 2004. Current DoD RFID policy focuses on In-Transit Visibility (ITV) support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) as the primary application of active RFID, and DoD Supply Management applications for passive RFID. This effort will ensure Fleet and component commands have deployable active RFID capability to support contingencies and DoD/Navy RFID policy. Navy has invested in and taken action to support implementation of 35 CONUS and OCONUS locations. These funds represent the Navy costs for the initial outfitting and life cycle costs to fully fund all currently identified COCOM ITV requirements. The Navy continues to coordinate with the Army's Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD-AMIS) for all aRFID and DOD AIT RF-ITV Contract installations, upgrades, hardware, software and infrastructure procurement requirements for Navy sites. Recently AIT aRFID Program Management support changed from the NAVSUP Global Logistics Support to the Weapons Systems Support Transportation and Distribution which provides a unique integration of logistics and analysis capability.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Specific FY18 increase in MHE includes $663K for one Mobile Cleaning Reclaim and Recovery System (MCRRS) unit. MCRRS is an environmentally safe vehicle for cleaning flight decks aboard aircraft carrier and air-capable L-class ships.  The MCRRS is expected to speed up carrier flight deck cleaning operations, reduce costs and virtually eliminate environmental impact of previous cleaning methods. 

The remaining increase reduces replacement backlog of over-aged and failing MHE equipment, which includes 31 of the 6,000 lb. 1330, 34 of the 6,000 lb. 1351 Shipboard, 35 of the 4,000 lb. 1370 Shipboard  and 50 of the 4,000 lb. 1390 Shipboard.

NAVY CASH PROGRAM: This program funds the procurement of the Navy CashTM system. Navy Cash was developed to improve business processes, create workload efficiencies, and enhance the quality of life for Sailors and Marines on board ship. It enhances the efficiencies and security of automated pay delivery and safekeeping deposit provided by the ATMs-at-Sea system that Navy Cash replaced. Everyone on a ship receives a Navy Cash or Marine Cash card, a branded debit card that looks like a typical debit or check card. It utilizes a pre-paid debit model to provide for a cashless shipboard environment for all retail and other personal financial transactions and helps to reduce the workload for the Disbursing Office and retail locations throughout the ship. This affords more time for core functions and thereby increases readiness. It also improves shipboard business practices by automating and significantly reducing the handling of bills, coins, personal checks, and money orders, automating back-end financial processes and minimizing error-prone cash transactions while it reduces the workload associated with cash management and improves the efficiency and accuracy of fiscal accountability. This overall reduction in the need for cash decreases the costs associated with maintaining large amounts of cash in the safes of ships for the six or more months of deployment. 

Navy Cash Installation Program:
2016 29 Installations (15 Small / 10 Med / 2 Large /  2 CVN)

AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT): The Department of Defense (DoD) promulgated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Policy on 30 July 2004. Current DoD RFID policy focuses on In-Transit Visibility (ITV) support of the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) as the primary application of active RFID, and DoD Supply Management applications for passive RFID. This effort will ensure Fleet and component commands have deployable active RFID capability to support contingencies and DoD/Navy RFID policy. Navy has invested in and taken action to support implementation of 35 CONUS and OCONUS locations. These funds represent the Navy costs for the initial outfitting and life cycle costs to fully fund all currently identified COCOM ITV requirements. The Navy continues to coordinate with the Army's Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD-AMIS) for all aRFID and DOD AIT RF-ITV Contract installations, upgrades, hardware, software and infrastructure procurement requirements for Navy sites. Recently AIT aRFID Program Management support changed from the NAVSUP Global Logistics Support to the Weapons Systems Support Transportation and Distribution which provides a unique integration of logistics and analysis capability.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>This line provides for new and systematic replacement of investment items required in support of the operational mission of the Navy's claimancy.  Procurement of Command Support Equipment throughout the Navy involves the purchase, replacement and upgrade of various pieces of equipment such as Cable Replacements and the purchase, repair, and upgrade of IT Infrastructure and Security Systems.  This equipment is an integral part of the programs to improve the fleet and shore establishment by maintaining or expanding existing capabilities or replacing ineffective units.

[P40A / NCIS Data Modernization &amp; Analytical Tools]: The NCIS mission is to support the day-to-day operations to Prevent Terrorism, Protection of National Secrets, Reduce Crime across the Department of Navy and Marine Corps, and comply with DON Mandates. Without the IT Program and Technical Support, these systems will impact NCIS ability to fulfill its mission as designated by SECNAVINST 5430.107. This will Negatively impact mission commanders in their warfighting capacity. Additionally, these IT services have a direct impact on security and monitoring of IT systems as defined in DOD 8500.02 and would violate the requirement and raise the risk of system security vulnerabilities. In addition, NCIS will be supporting the Naval Justice Information System (NJIS), Tactical Network, and VTC infrastructure initiatives.

[P40A / OCHR - Human Resource IT system]: Procurement funding ensures that production and modernization of Human Resources Civilian Personnel (HRCP) in support of DON HR Enterprise Systems remain in accordance with DOD and DON modernization efforts are met, technical refresh of past-shelf-life infrastructure supporting HRCP, and planned HRLINK licensing expansion in compliance to ESL mandates to DON Functional Communities.
   
Routine Technical Refresh -  $116K
Licensing - IBM/ESL Contract via ImmixTechnology   $325K

[P40A / FIP]: Funding will be used for procurement of additional modules/ capabilities to improve Navy ERP user experience and actions to correct deficiencies found in the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) audit. FISCAM resourcing requirements are growing as an increasing number of deficiencies are identified due to non-compliance with financial audit standards resulting from inadequate internal controls among DON business processes and IT systems.

[P40A / Insider Threat]: The Navy Insider Threat program seeks to meet Defense and Department of the Navy direction to deter, detect, and mitigate the risk of compromise due to insider threats. Insider Threat to Cybersecurity will enable accomplishment of these objectives by providing a user activity monitoring capability, a mechanism for fusing collected information with security risk data from multiple other sources, and a graphical display to facilitate threat analysis, identification, and initial action. This effort is to procure, configure, and install hardware and software in support of the Insider Threat program.

[P40A / Electronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS)]: Electronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS):  

Electronic Military Personnel Record System (EMPRS) is an electronic document/image based system that serves as the repository for all Department of Navy (DoN) official military personnel record images (over 170 million images).  It supports retired, active, and reserve military personnel in the functional areas of selection board operations, casualty management, mobilization, veteran benefits (providing automated Sailor information to the Veterans Administration) and other military personnel management functions.  EMPRS annually supports over 150 statutory and administrative selection boards, providing over 12 million service record images, covering promotions, assignments, and retention. References: Title 10 &amp; 44, U. S. Code and Title 36, CFR (Record Management Requirements), DoD Directive 5015.2 

OPN funding provided allows us to use an acquisition strategy that is both cost efficient and effective.  This strategy sustains the EMPRS program throughout the FYDP, providing technology refreshment (TR) throughout the years (evolutionary) as opposed to a TR every 8 years.  This provides vital upgrades in a more timely manner.  An 8 year refresh cycle of IT would require reliance on old system and software, by IT standards, that frequently result in compatibility issues as new systems and software are fielded, thus driving up sustainment costs.  Evolutionary technical refreshment is a more cost effective strategy.

[P40A / Peripherals]: :  Peripherals represent auxiliary and infrastructure components that make up and are associated with the EMPRS system, which supports the Navy's selection board processes for all Officer and senior enlisted personnel (E7 &amp; above).  EMPRS is the major information system which is mutually supported by infrastructure to conduct 160 selection boards on an annual basis.  Peripherals include items such as removable walls within boardrooms that function as display screen for military personnel record display, keyboards, printers, monitors, mice for workstations in the boardrooms, etc.

[P40A / Electronic Security System (ESS) Replacement/Upgrade]: Electronic Security System (ESS) Replacement/Upgrade

[P40A / System - Crisis Announcement]: The U.S. Naval War College (NWC) requires a distributed control crisis mass emergency real time assisted voice evacuation and mass communication system within the NWC complex to comply with published safety standards.  The required installation will enable NWC security and leadership personnel to operate a supervised and distributed, integrated compound wide system of emergency response.  This system will provide an announcement system for the College to mitigate additional emergency situations such as active shooter, bomb threats and other threat scenarios.   The required system would assist in the protection of life and property by indicating the existence of an emergency situation and providing "real time" instructions to a large number of people whether inside a building or spread out the NWC complex and surrounding area on Newport Naval Station.   As a host of International Senior Officers and numerous U.S. dignitaries, both military and civilian, the Naval War College lacks to capability coordinate the responses of the 1,500 personnel on campus.

[P40A / Converged ERP]: Converged Enterprise Resource Planning:   The Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution is an integrated business management system that modernizes and standardizes Navy's business processes.  Navy ERP utilizes best commercial practices to provide real-time information exchange, unprecedented financial and asset visibility, and improved reporting and decision-making capabilities across key acquisition, financial, and logistics operations.
 
Navy ERP is the tool chosen to meet Congressional mandates to establish and maintain federal financially compliant management systems, federal accounting standards, and U.S. Government General Ledger procedures at the transaction level.  The Navy ERP foundation to achieve enterprise-wide business transformation is accomplished through two releases:  the Financial/Acquisition Solution and the Single Supply Solution.  
 
The Navy has overcome a broad range of challenges to successfully deploy financial, acquisition, and workforce management capabilities to all the major acquisition Systems Commands, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and Strategic Systems Programs (SSP).  These commands include up to 72,000 users and $69B of the Navy's Total Obligation Authority (TOA).  Navy ERP has deployed and stabilized the Single Supply Solution covering all Navy's Material Groups and Fleet Logistic Centers (FLCs) and Partner Sites. 
 
The project acquires standard applications servers (ADP hardware) which are hosted in a Navy Data Center at NAS Patuxent River to support ERP software for the Navy Converged ERP Program.  Funding reflects procurement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) hardware, software, and licenses in support of the SAP enterprise system environment for the Navy ERP Program.

[P40A / Ashore Equipment]: NSIPS is the Navy's world-wide system for the field level input of pay and personnel transactions.  NSIPS supports active duty and reserve users ashore through a single web site, and on approximately 125 ships. NSIPS collects, validates, processes and transfers the data necessary to ensure accurate and timely pay and maintenance of personnel records.

NSIPS is a modern, cost-effective human resources capability that fully integrates business processes, tools, and authoritative data to efficiently and effectively manage the military workforce. NSIPS is being enhanced to systematically modernize the Navy's pay and personnel processes and systems. NSIPS relies on technical refresh to maintain the usability, functionality and supportability of the systems ashore to avoid technical obsolescence.  The technical refresh of ashore equipment (hardware and software) will be performed on an annual basis throughout the FYDP.

[P40A / Electronic Procurement System (ePS)]: ELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM (ePS):
The electronic Procurement System (ePS) is the Department of the Navy's (DON) End-to-End (E2E) Contract Writing System (CWS).  It will provide the Navy and Marine Corps contracting community with a full contract writing management capability and facilitate integration with federally mandated systems, DON financial systems, and industry.  The ePS will utilize Department of Defense (DoD) standards and support auditability.  The ePS will address existing CWS challenges including outdated architecture, limited capabilities, scalability concerns, and existing legacy systems.

Full deployment of the ePS ensures compliance of the DON's contracting abilities with the following legislative mandates: the writing and management of all contracts must now occur in congressionally approved computer systems (Section 862 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2013); the central management and oversight of all DoD business (10 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) Section 2222); and all contracting actions must be fully auditable and traceable (Section 1003 of the NDAA 2010 &amp; Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance).   

The ePS will use DoD data exchange capabilities (e.g.; Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Purchase Request Data Standard (PRDS)) in order to achieve standardized data interoperability with external systems.  The Navy Enterprise Service Bus (NESB) serves as the hub to relay procurement data to various finance and other systems of record, such as Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (NERP), Standard Accounting &amp; Reporting System (STARS) and Standard Accounting Budgeting &amp; Reporting System (SABRS). 

The result of successful ePS implementation will be a contracting workforce that issues accurate and timely contracts in a standard format that comply with all DoD/Federal laws, regulations, and policies.

[P40A / Maritime Operations Center (MOC) Procurement]: MOCs deliver Navy Command and Control (C2) capabilities at the Operational Level of War (OLW)  that guide execution of the six (6) core capabilities of the Navy as outlined in the 2009 A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower (Forward Presence, Deterrence, Sea Control, Power Projection, Maritime Security, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response) through the full range of military operations (ROMO).  The MOC initiative focuses on improving the Navy's OLW C2 by establishing baseline capabilities in globally-networked MOCs enabling Numbered Fleet and Navy Component Commanders (NFC/NCC) to assume a range of Service and Joint roles while continuing to accomplish traditional Fleet management functions.  The MOC construct enhances C2 of Navy forces at the operational level through headquarters manned by individuals qualified in joint operational-level staff processes and enabled by globally interoperable Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.  MOCs provide organizational consistency, the scalability and flexibility to transition between various command roles, and enhanced global networking among Navy and Joint organizations.  The desired end state/goal of the system-of-systems methodology embodied in each of the eight (8) MOCs is to achieve globally-networked operational-level C2 decisions by NCC, Joint Force Maritime Component Commanders (JFMCC) and Commanders of Joint Task Forces (CJTF).  Focused acquisition of standard and common suites of systems (from the existing base of Navy, Army, Air Force and joint Programs of Record (PORs) and non-PORs) facilitates successful accomplishment of designated Joint Mission-Essential Tasks (JMETS) aligned to Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) and in support of Combatant Commander theater objectives.

This system of systems approach aims to achieve effective, agile, networked and scalable MOCs, employing common doctrine, standardized processes and common C4I systems.  Each MOC will be able to operate within a common organizational construct in various roles (joint, interagency and combined).  The global network and commonality enable both reach-back and load-sharing across all MOCs within a Navy enterprise network to include Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) networks.  The eight (8) MOCs consist of nine (9) sites (seven (7) ashore and two (2) afloat) including each of the numbered Fleets (Commander Third Fleet (C3F); Commander Fourth Fleet (C4F); Commander Fifth Fleet (C5F); Commander Sixth Fleet (C6F) ashore and forward afloat; Commander Seventh Fleet (C7F); Commander Tenth Fleet (C10F); Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT); and U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) NCCs.

[P40A / BCO Infrastructure Replacement (Cable &amp; Equipment)]: In FY18 the following work efforts will be performed (BSO 60): Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station Far East (NCTSFE) requires Fiber Optic Backbone Realignment on Fleet Activities Yokosuka. BLII engineering and installation did not ensure nor provide for redundancy in case of meteorological, geological, or intentional service interruption. Out-side plant Fiber has been installed by many different efforts with no logical hierarchy and no redundancy to the critical C2 nodes as there are actually five separate fiber optical backbones that do not connect. Current optical backbone infrastructure will not support Assured Services LAN (ASLAN) in accordance with DOD Unified Capability Requirements (DOD UCR 2008) allowing converged distribution of  voice, video and data services to include redundancy and diversity of critical C2 and special C2 infrastructure. This results in C2 buildings being single-threaded and at great risk of potential loss of service in a catastrophic event. Key users who will lose connectivity include the NATIONAL COMMAND AUTHORITIES, Combatant Commanders of the Unified Commands, and strategic and tactical subordinate commanders.
Additional cost in FY17 and FY18 are due to new/upgraded Base Communication Office (BCO) Outside cable plant infrastructure upgrades required to comply with Unified Capabilities (UC) specifications IAW DoDI 8100.04. Unified Capabilities are the integration of voice, video, and/or data services delivered ubiquitously across a secure and highly available infrastructure, independent of technology, to provide increased mission effectiveness to the warfighter and business communities.

            <proc:Justification>NCIS Data Modernization &amp; Analytical Tools

Increase in funding supports components of NCIS' NJIS Scanning, Tactical Network and VTC infrastructure initiatives.  As the DON begins the roll-out of NJIS, NCIS has a requirement to deploy a variety of high speed scanning capabilities across the enterprise to capture investigative data. NCIS is under development to host critical investigative and operational capabilities which will provide a secure and private environment that allows the investigative technical components of the organization to conduct their mission more efficiently. A number of investigative tools and techniques will leverage this tactical network to include Investigative Cyber Security; Technical Services; Cyber, Technical Surveillance Counter Measures (TSCM), Tech Services, Bio-Metrics, etc. Currently, these capabilities are scattered across separate networks and are not integrated or available to the agency as a whole. Furthermore, NCIS' conference rooms and Leadership Desktop Units are reaching end-of-life and replacement of these systems will give NCIS the capabilities to securely communicate about ongoing investigative and operational sensitive cases to support mission requirements. 

Office of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR):  Human Resources IT System

Office of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR) provides information technology system support for over 204,000 civilians at more than 1,340 naval activities throughout the world.  These systems are the core of human resource support for the Department of the Navy.  The OCHR Systems Division has the responsibility to implement, sustain, and support the hardware, software, systems and applications, functional administration, and communications infrastructure in accordance with the Department of Navy Chief Information Office, Naval Network Warfare Command, Navy Marine Corp Intranet, and DOD Civilian Personnel Management Services mandates, directives, and policies. The technology for the myriad of human resource applications requires upgrades and/or additional capability to support and maintain the integrity of these systems cost effectively.

DON Financial Improvement Program (FIP) -- formed in response to Congressional mandates for Navy-Marine Corps and the rest of the Defense Department to achieve financial auditability.  The FIP is a Department-wide multi-year change management effort which requires fundamental improvements to processes and systems as well as to the business culture to implement those strengthened internal controls.  Increase in FY18 will be used for the STARS to SABRS (S2S) transition hardware and software (HW/SW) required for supporting DON SABRS/SMARTS. This funding begins to address the many HW/SW requirements to transition the 11 BSOs migrating over to SABRS.   Implementation will allow DON to comply with OSD's Financial Management (FM) Functional Strategy, to (1) simplify the financial management environment; (2) make the environment more efficient; and, (3) generate auditable budget and accounting data.

The Smart Grid provides first time capability to intelligently analyze energy data from 16,849 smart meters previously installed to comply with the Energy Policy Act 2005 (Public Law 109-58-August 8, 2005) and the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 (Public Law 110-140-December 19, 2007. The Smart Grid aggregates meter data with highest energy consuming 2042 buildings and 174 utility control systems to intelligently and continuously identify cost savings opportunities, providing 2 of the 8 Trillion BTU energy savings needed to achieve the 50% Navy energy reduction target. The Smart Grid brings first time transparency of building and utility system operations and behavior, essential to both monitor for, and react to, a cyber-event.

Maritime Operations Center (MOC): The FY 2018 funding will provide for procurement, production engineering, integration and installations required to continue incremental improvements of the common capabilities of the MOCs, leading to fully-integrated, globally-networked operational-level commands with a Navy enterprise network and appropriate capabilities to exercise Command and Control (C2) over Navy missions, such as Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), in accordance with MOC baseline requirements.

BCO Infrastructure: FY18 increase is to support infrastructure upgrades, Fiber and copper, in the Far East Region and represents a fraction of the BCO OPN requirements.  This antiquated cable plant needs to be replaced due to hazardous material and are not compliant with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1025 or 29CFR 1926.62. The outside cable plant at Navy facilities is antiquated, resulting in significant and frequent failures due to deterioration of cabling insulation. The failure rate is accelerating which is causing prolonged system outages.

Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS)

Per USCYBERCOM System Requirements Document, each CPT must be provisioned with 2 Deployable Mission Support Systems (DMSS) to support two simultaneous team deployments (40 total). The CPTs primary mission is to Survey, Secure, and Protect military networks (aboard Navy ships, data centers, and shore sites worldwide) which necessitates onsite vulnerability assessments and incident response on little to no notice.  Field deployable computing assets for the 20 Navy CPTs are required to allow deployable teams to conduct intensive, computationally-heavy analysis when reach-back capability is unavailable or bandwidth is limited.  In addition, Navy CPTs located in CONUS will be required to deploy cyber planning and incident response elements into theater to support C4F, C5F, and C6F mission assurance objectives to include identification of cyber key terrain and OPLAN development.

OCO: 
Maritime Operations Center (MOC) Server Room 

MOC C2 Server Room Relocation is needed now to correct material and safety hazards. MOC C2 Server Room was designed using 1990's technologies, safety and physical security practices. COMUSNAVCENT recognized many deficiencies and safety hazards and funded SSCLANT $3.2M in FY15 to provide design and engineering services to determine requirements to correct safety hazards and relocate the current MOC C2 Server Room and all systems to another location. The current MOC C2 Server Room presents several risks to life, mission, and cybersecurity. Critical issues needing immediate correction are replacement of wet fire suppression with dry system, replacing cabinets/racks with hot-aisle containment system to improve cooling and physical security, and replace rack power distribution to overhead vice below floor to eliminate shock hazard in case of wet fire suppression discharge.   If not funded with OCO funds, C5F  MOC, and Coalition forces will not be able to provide timely and effective Command and Control decisions necessary in the pursuit of US, and Coalition, Strategic Objectives within the CENTCOM Theatre 

Briefing Display System 

An approved FY17 upgrade of BDS did not properly take into consideration scope growth of the project needed to replace or upgrade all end-of-life components or technology inflation. The U.S. Naval Forces Central Command's (NAVCENT) Briefing Display System (BDS) is the primary battlespace awareness tool used by the Combined Maritime Forces US and Coalition Watch Team as well as NAVCENT leadership Command and Control. BDS is a multifaceted Video Information System providing battlespace awareness video to the Combined Maritime Operation Center (CMOC), Alternate Maritime Operations Center (AMOC), War Room, Flag/Coalition Command Suite, Department Head offices, conference rooms and key coalition leadership. BDS is essential to US and Coalition leadership command and control of all naval forces in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.  Current BDS suite is beyond end-of-life with necessary repairs to critical components like VTC and the "Knowledge Wall" made all the more expensive due to their obsolescence.   As a result, a proposed rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for this upgrade fell short of completing all needed work.  The BDS fund is a supplemental follow on from the approved project in PB17.  Loss of any of these feeds would severely hamper the mission of COMUSNNAVCENT and Coalition Partners to direct operations in the CENTCOM AOR.  

Navy Enterprise Tactical Command and Control (NETC2) 

NETC2 is required to provide cyber compliant COOP capability.  JMAST in COMUSNAVENCT's current Command and Control (C2) systems COOP site; it is scheduled to be decommissioned as of 30SEP2016 with no replacement identified.  JMAST is antiquated (beyond end-of-life) and cannot be made Information assurance (IA) compliant in its current state.  Moreover, JMAST is comprised of legacy equipment that is no longer supported by the POR.  Only 1 NETC2 is required.  Further discussions with PMW 790 after UFR submitted indicated that one unit can scale to meet NAVCENT requirements with additional cost.  Cost of $2.5M is for 50 seats.  NAVCENT requires 100 seats therefore; requested funding level remains at $5M to support capacity and capability of the COOP requirement.  Failure to fund the NETC2 procurement with OCO funding results in dramatically increased unfunded requirement to be potentially filled with Operation and Management costs (estimated to be over $2Million per annum) as COMUSNAVCENT will be required to maintain all existing JMAST equipment and personnel organically.</proc:Justification>

MNP is a key business initiative of Personnel Service Delivery Transformation, the overarching Navy effort to facilitate Sailor human resource interactions via automation. To that end, MNP will provide a single electronic point of entry for Sailors to manage and view their personnel and career information within a self-service environment. Sailors will experience a common look and feel in using various manpower, personnel, training, and education (MPTE) applications. The primary users of MNP are active component (AC) and reserve component (RC) Sailors. In addition to increasing self-service, MNP will reduce service delivery costs and improve HR data accuracy and availability.">20) Navy Human Resource Operations Center (HROC) My Navy Portal</proc:Name>

            <proc:Description>Beginning in FY17, funding was consolidated under LI 8101 Training and Education Equipment.

The U. S. Naval Academy's mission is to ensure the best educated and most qualified junior officers enter the naval service.  The Academy must maintain the highest standards in academic disciplines and supporting infrastructure.  Planned upgrades and replacements are vital in ensuring graduates are technologically prepared to serve in tomorrow's Fleet and Fleet Marine Force while supporting institutional accreditation and competitiveness with peer institutions.

A.  Universal Wireless Telecommunications System - DAS Cellular ($1,585K FY 2016):
FY 2013 provides upgrades of existing telecommunications system to enhance cellular  coverage within the historic Bancroft Hall dormitory for midshipmen quality of life and personal safety benefits.  Existing mobile communications coverage within this 1.4 million square foot historic facility is inadequate to accommodate evolving midshipmen, staff and faculty needs.  The envisioned provider-neutral solution will include a distributed antenna system (DAS) enabling robust signal coverage for the benefit of all occupants.  FY 2016 follow-on extends cellular coverage to academic buildings for enhancement of classroom and laboratory instruction as existing mobile communications coverage within these facilities is inadequate to accommodate evolving science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and cyber computing needs of midshipmen, faculty and staff.

            <proc:Description>This budget line item funds procurement of various items of equipment to support the operating forces at Naval Stations and related facilities, including, but not limited to the following:

Mobile Aircraft Fire Training Devices:  Procurement of a trailer mounted fully-contained device that allows firefighters to conduct live fire fighting techniques to meet Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) requirements. The device has interior and exterior fire scenario props to fully prepare the firefighters for aircraft firefighting and rescue missions. Combination Interior and Structure Training Device:  Procurement of combination confined space, SCBA, Shipboard Sub, and structural fire fighter mobile trainer focused on interior aircraft and structure fire training evolutions to meet NAVAIR, DoN, and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements.  The unit is used for live fire training and practical rescue exercises.

Mobile Aircraft Training Devices are necessary for the Navy's firefighters to meet minimum firefighting requirements and qualifications. Baseline budget replaces dilapidated equipment and procures new systems to ensure that the Navy's firefighters are able to keep up to date on technology and techniques of interior and/or exterior firefighting.  Strategic placement of these devices will also minimize travel training costs and maximize our members training opportunities.

Cranes and/or Boat Hoists:  Procurement of cranes/hoist of various types and sizes (Davit/Bridge/Portal/Gantry/Mobile Harbor).  All are weight handling systems designed/selected to meet the specific requirements of the intended facility. 

Fender/Bumper/Separator Systems:  Procurement includes various size and shaped energy absorbing cushions placed between a pier and a ship/submarine or between two ships/submarines. Multiple fenders may be used with different size and types of ships.  Various types of filling of air or other material may be procured.  Standard type is hydro-pneumatic rubber fender made IAW ISO 17357.  May be used for both submarine and surface ships.

Composite CVN Camels:  Procurement of large floating metal or composite structures designed to maintain the proper distance for CV/CVNs to keep the ships from being damaged or damaging the pier structure.  When USN Carriers are placed alongside a pier the hull design dictates the need to use standoff equipment.  The camels requested provide the necessary standoff. These composite camels offer considerable reduction in maintenance due to constructed material.  As currently utilized ship support equipment ages it becomes necessary to replace that equipment.  Equipment procurement budgets are not adequate to keep up with the demand for ship support equipment.  As more ships are placed into service the requirement exceeds currently available support equipment.  

Submarine Deep Draft Camels:  Procurement of very large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance for submarines to keep them from being damaged by the pier.  These may be for specific submarine classes (e.g. Fast Attack), or universal (i.e. for all submarine classes).

Universal Submarine Composite Camels:  Procurement of universal pierside, composite camels used to breast submarines from piers/wharves.  They are fabricated of universal composite material with a modular design.  Size is approximately 36 ft W x 18 ft H x 17.6 ft D.  Made per a standard NAVFAC drawing.  Suitable for all classes of submarines.

Utility and Maintenance/Paint Floats and Barges: Procurement of floating assets that are used by Port Operations and Ship's Force personnel to facilitate external ship work (blasting, painting, other maintenance).  They can also be used as separators or camels.  These can be towed into place, or may even be self-propelled.  They may have permanent or movable work platforms installed as needed to assist in reaching work sites.  Some may have self-ballasting mechanisms to help maintain stability.  They come in various sizes.

Composite Sub camels - as constructed the composite Submarine camels significantly reduce the amount of maintenance required to keep the units serviceable.  Older models, reaching the end of serviceability are made of steel and in some cases wood.  To overhaul these units requires considerable manpower. The older units do not provide the same level of hull protection the composite units provide.  Equipment procurement budgets are not adequate to keep up with the demand for ship support equipment.  As more ships are placed into service the requirement exceeds currently available support equipment.

[P40A / DDG Separators]: Large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance for DDG's when nested outboard of another DDG. Also, provides protection from ship-to-ship damage due to vessel maneuvers or where vessel-to-pier contact may occur.

[P40A / Composite Submarine Camels]: CNIC'S phased replacement program for submarine camels has taken significant negative budget marks during the past fiscal years.  These reductions have negatively affected CNIC ability to sustain a viable phased replacement program along with reducing funding new purchases.  Continued budget reduction will erode CNIC's ability to protect the Navy's platforms (submarines and surface ships) at the waterfront.

[P40A / ESS &amp; IDS NA-283]: Intrusion Detection System (IDS): IDS equipment includes the interior and exterior sensor, surveillance devices and associated communications subsystems that collectively detect intrusion at a specified site, facility, or perimeter.

[P40A / THALES MK-20A Instrument Landing Systems]: Procurement of NAVAIR supported Instrument Landing Systems to provide landing capability in adverse weather conditions

[P40A / CVN Camels]: 6E70 - CVN Camels:  Procurement of very large floating composite structures, designed to maintain the proper standoff distance for CVNs to keep the ships from being damaged or damaging the pier structure.  This budget request supports the Navy's CVN 21 Future Carrier ship coming online.  Currently, there are no viable assets (CVN Camels) to support homeporting for the Navy' new CVN. The cost increase is associated with using composite material vice steel. These CVN camels are designed to last 25 years. The current inventory of steel CVN camel are past their service life and require an overhaul, without which they may only keep afloat for a couple of years.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Baseline budget procures replacement fenders/bumpers/separator systems to replace current inventory that will be at the end of their service life in FY17.  These will be used at locations with heightened traffic and current infrastructure that is incapable of supporting the expanded requirement, specifically Jacksonville, FL and Pearl Harbor, HI.

This budget request supports CVN Camels for the Navy's CVN 21 Future Carrier ship coming online.  Currently, there are no viable assets (CVN Camels) to support homeporting for the Navy's new CVN.

The current inventory of steel CVN camel are past their service life and require an overhaul, without which they may only keep afloat for a couple of years. 

FY 2017 decrease in Operating Forces Supt Equip OPN by $0.201M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

The FY 2018 budget request was reduced by $1.221M due to prior year underexecution.

The FY17 amended budget requested $16.256M of additional funds to support approved procurement of operating forces support equipment at Navy Installations worldwide. The equipment consists of ship and submarine separators
as well as different types of maintenance barges that are at the end of their service life. Investment in this area had been deferred due to sequestration and other fiscal constraints and equipment recapitalization is necessary.

Additional Equipment includes:

5 DDG Separators at Navy Regions SW, Hawaii, Japan, and Guam, required to maintain the proper distance of DDGs when nested outboard of another DDG
2 CVN Camels at Midlant and NW respectively, which are very large floating metal structures designed to maintain the proper distance of CV/CVNs
3 Deep Draft Sub Separators at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (2) and Midlant (1), designed to maintain proper distance of Fast Attack or Universal Submarines
2 Paint Maintenance Barges at NW and GUAM
1 3-Tier Paint Float Barge at SE used to paint the sides of vessels when in port
1 4.5 meter Hydro Sub Separator at SW which is a hydro-pneumatic rubber fender used for both Subs and Surface Ships
2 4.5 meter Fender-Bumper-Separator Systems at Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia (EURAFSWA) and Japan, used as energy absorbing cushions placed between the pier and vessels or between vessels of different size and shapes.
2 Portable Dock/Docking Systems at CNRJ that are moveable docking systems that can be used to berth small Navy boats e.g. harbor security boats, utility and work boats known as the Pontoon Section

OCO: 
OCO/OPN for Isa Air Base F18 Live Fire Training Device ($0.700M):

In the past, ISA Air Base's (AB) Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) personnel were on a six-month rotation and would receive their required NAVAIR live fire training at home station, prior to arrival.  This rotation period has changed to allow F&amp;ES personnel to permanently stay in-place on ISA AB.  Currently, workarounds are used to acquire required NAVAIR live fire training.  ISA AB's Structural and Combination Helicopter/Car live fire trainers are acting as substitute training aids; with minimal realism and effectiveness.  

To meet NAVAIR requirements, an on-site, F18 Jet Live Fire Trainer is needed for ISA AB F&amp;ES personnel to: provide training fires and realistic, forcible entry into and rescue from burning aircraft to obtain and maintain the desired standards of proficiency; conduct a minimum of six, semi-annual live fire training evolutions; and obtain the desired realisms by ensuring aircraft mockup is constructed as close to scale and appearance of actual aircraft.   

New training device will allow CNIC to meet OPNAVINST, NAVAIR, Department of Defense and National Fire Protection Association standards for Fire Service training requirements. The live fire training device will ensure proficiency of aircraft fire rescue personnel.

Patrol Craft SIGINT Capability:

Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) in the Maritime Domain and Choke Points are on the USCENTCOM FY18-22 Integrated Priorities List.  Funding is needed to provide a cryptologic capability on all PC units to the USCENTCOM AOR.  There are currently two PC units outfitted with a similar capability (PC-SCOUT).  The original PC-SCOUT project was funded with FY12 OPN and was executed in 2014 with installations onboard the two PCs in November and December 2014. The original PC-SCOUT initiative filled critical gaps in NAVCENT's collection posture and provided unique access to targets of interest.  OCO funding is needed to upgrade existing capability and increase NAVCENT/C5F's Organic Persistent ISR capability and allow NAVCENT/C5F to meet its intelligence requirements in the littorals not accessible by current collection platforms and POR systems.
COMFIFTHFLT has a mission critical operational need to provide ISR in support of Named Operations and other maritime activities in the USCENTCOM area of responsibility.  Small littoral vessels (PC) with enhanced collection systems are exceptional platforms (at reduced operating and maintenance costs when compared to DDG and CG program of record systems), due to their operational employment, low electromagnetic interference (EMI) profile, coupled with remote capabilities/resources has resulted in increased awareness of NAVCENT/C5F intelligence priorities.  Without adequate OCO funding to support PC SIGINT collection system, NAVCENT/C5F's ability to collect, monitor, and target significant adversarial maritime activity in the littoral area will increase the risk of miscalculation and translate into potential mission failure and loss of life.

            <proc:Description>ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEM Lifecycle replacement and upgrade of digital acoustic measurement systems used to collect data used to build gridded data bases of layered geoacoustic descriptions of the ocean floor and low frequency bottom loss databases, collect fleet anti-submarine warfare support measurements, produce high resolution anti-submarine warfare area assessment products, and serve to provide critical environmental input to fleet acoustic transmission loss models. System consists of multi-channel variable depth buoys, shipboard data acquisition, control, and processing support systems. Buoys acquire the data, provide signal conditioning and gain, and store the data in digital form. 

ACOUSTIC POSITIONING SYSTEM (ULTRA SHORT BASELINE (USBL)) The Acoustic Positioning System (APS) is an Ultra Short Baseline (USBL) Acoustic Positioning System used to provide high accuracy navigation and location of towed bodies and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) deployed from T-AGS 60 oceanographic survey vessels. The APS is permanently installed aboard each vessel and supports tracking objects in any direction out to a 5000m radius. In addition, it is used to precisely locate lost vehicles or instrumentation for purposes of recovery. Current navigation techniques can be inaccurate as they rely on approximations resulting in imprecise location data and degraded environmental data. This can lead to a substantially increased processing time and increased risk of missed coverage. With the ability of APS to determine accurate location data, the cost, practicality, and search time to recover a lost vehicle is substantially reduced. 

CROSS DOMAIN SOLUTION (CDS) Meteorology and Atmospheric data is a highly perishable, mission-essential element in planning for almost all operational missions performed by the United States Navy. Excessive time delays in dissemination of oceanographic and meteorological products/services may add significant risk to our operational forces. This CDS provides a mechanism by which oceanographic and meteorological products/services can be disseminated to DoD end users on the SIPRNET as it is collected and produced.

DEEP MULTIBEAM INSTALLATION The full ocean multibeam sonar system is the primary ocean mapping tool in greater than 300 meters of water to full ocean. The deep-water multibeam system will be a state-of-the-art commercial one by one degree multibeam having a maximum swath coverage of six times water depth. The survey system includes an integrated deep water sub-bottom profiler system. The system will be installed on all T-AGS 60 class ships as a life-cycle replacement for the existing deep water multibeam system which has exceeded its life expectancy and will no longer be supported by the manufacturer. Multibeam systems collect deep-water bathymetry data required to support special chart production for the Navy. 

DIGITAL SIDE SCAN SONAR (SHIP) Additional high-speed, high resolution side scan sonar systems are required to meet fleet requirements supporting mine warfare operations. The intended system procured will be installed aboard USNS HENSON and additional T-AGS 60 class ships to replicate the system aboard USNS HEEZEN. The procurement will facilitate simultaneous collection of high resolution imagery at mine warfare resolutions and frequencies. The imagery data is required to generate products that directly support mine warfare, hydrographic and oceanographic requirements. Side scan sonar data is critical for the detection of small mine-like targets as well as hazards-to-navigation (e.g. wrecks) and characterizing the sea-floor over large areas (geoprovincing). This data is fundamental to execute MIW change-detection doctrine comparing historical data to current data to determine mine-threats. 

FLEET SURVEY TEAM INTEGRATED SURVEY PLATFORM Purchases transportable hydrographic survey platform systems used for rapid response, contingency, and emergent high-priority survey requirements. The platform is 7-9 meter air-transportable survey boat (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB) type) with installed and fukky-integrated Multibeam Echo-Sounder RESON 7125, Single Beam Echo-Sounder, Digital Side Scan Sonar, Wide-Area Differential Global Positioning System navigation, Inertial Motion sensor system, Data Acquisition Work-Station (PC), Sound Velocity Probe, and Electric winch. The boat and trailer are designed for transport in a C-130 aircraft and rigged for hoisting.  

HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY LAUNCH (HSL) MISSION EQUIPMENT This OPN line item involves the life-cycle replacement of the entire mission equipment suite currently installed aboard the operational fleet of HSL (seven HSLs and the Bertram). The mission equipment suite includes, but is not limited to, shallow water multibeam systems, single beam systems, navigation systems, data collection and storage systems, forward-looking sonar systems, and digital side scan systems. This does not include high-resolution digital side scan systems used for mine warfare. Life-cycle replacement of these systems is critical to ensure state-of-the-art hydrographic surveying capability in littoral areas. Also, due to the harsh environmental conditions encountered by HSLs during typical hydrographic surveys, planned replacement of their mission equipment is necessary to guarantee long-term supportability.
 
INTEGRATED SUB-BOTTOM PROFILER These systems are life cycle replacements for existing Sub Bottom Profiler systems that have exceeded life expectancy and do not currently provide high resolution digital acoustic data with precision positioning and navigational capability that is required for Mine Warfare missions. Systems will operate in conjunction with the new deep-water multibeam systems that were installed in FY15. 
 
LITTORAL BATTLESPACE SENSING, FUSION, AND INTEGRATION (LBSF&amp;I) supports ocean sensing and data collection and the integration of that data into a common environmental picture. Funding supports procurement of a technology infrastructure capability designed to fuse and integrate data collected under this program with extant static and dynamic data to produce the best available and most accurate battle space environmental characterization used to deliver decision superiority and information dominance to the combatant commander. 

LONG TERM AMBIENT NOISE RECORDING AND REPORTING SYSTEM Long Term Ambient Noise Recording and Reporting System is a moored, acoustic buoy system used to support ISR missions. The buoys are four channel Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS) units that will record ambient noise for long time periods within an 8kHz bandwidth. The Environmental Acoustic Recording System buoys will have to be recovered for data processing. 

MASTER CLOCK SYSTEMS These systems consist of: Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning systems to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls. These systems will allow for more rapid, robust and autonomous characterization of the Rubidium Fountains and Hydrogen Masers in the timing ensemble at United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Rb fountain clocks deliver the precise time and time interval required to support GPS III requirements and national assets. 
 
OCEANOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (OIS) ARCHITECTURE The Oceanographic Information System (OIS) architecture provides the corporate information technology infrastructure to enable the collection, processing, storage, archival, retrieval, and dissemination of oceanographic data, products, and other scientific information delivering Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) superiority to the Fleet. Funds life cycle support and technology refresh to upgrade the end-to-end processing and production systems. Deployment of new state-of-the-art oceanographic sensors, such as high-speed, high-resolution digital side scan sonar systems, collect data volumes far in excess of the current OIS capability to receive, process, store, and archive data. The integration of Fleet through-the-sensor data into OIS production and the collection of remotely sensed data add to the complexity of the technology infrastructure required for OIS. Upgrades to existing corporate storage resources that support the data warehouse and expand the storage area network to meet anticipated data storage requirements are included. The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS) FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.

PNN41 - PORTABLE MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT Portable Multibeam Sonar System is a roll-on/roll-off life cycle replacement for the RESON 8101 (4 systems) and the RESON 8125 (1 system). These systems provide the means to rapidly deploy a multibeam capability onto a craft of opportunity in order to support emergent naval requirements. Portability is key to enable rapid response to urgent or short-fused demands. The new systems provide an increase in survey efficiency, reduced maintenance costs, and an improvement in data quality. The Portable Multibeam Sonar System that replaces the RESON 8125 will provide high-resolution swath bathymetry along with side scan sonar imaging capability. This system will provide bottom imagery to facilitate MIW route surveys and navigation hazard surveys. 

PRIMARY OCEAN PREDICTION SYSTEM (POPS) ENHANCEMENTS Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global Meteorological and Oceanographic Command (METOC) support of the fleet. POPS-Met operates within a 24/7 reachback operations center supporting global fleet operations with weather and ocean prediction products and warfighting applications that are critical to fleet safety and warfighting effectiveness. POPS-Met provides the technology and infrastructure to sustain global operations ashore and afloat by providing timely, relevant, 24/7 METOC data and products to the fleet, Department of Defense, joint, allied, and coalition warfighters at all classification levels. POPS-Met acquires and sustains the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) environments to provide most of the assured METOC forecast products and services for Tier 1 of the Battlespace on Demand, which originate directly from the METOC models, satellite processing software, and applications. Tier 1 also provides input to many of the Battlespace on Demand Tier 2 and Tier 3 Products. Ongoing technology refreshment is required to meet the growing demand for these products, particularly in response to greater emphasis on preparation for and response to regional conflicts, and the greater data volume from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and future remotely sensed environmental data sources. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reachback customer support. Together, these enhancements will provide the Fleet with more accurate and responsive environmental support across all three Tiers of Battlespace on Demand. The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.

SHARC-REMUS ACOMM SYSTEM The SHARC-REMUS ACOMM System (SRAS) is an Acoustic Positioning System (APS) which provides high accuracy navigation and location of Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The APS is installed aboard a Sensor Housing Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARC), a long-duration Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that utilizes wave energy for propulsion and solar panels for energy replenishment of core systems and sensors. The SHARC, equipped with the SRAS, functions as a Communications and Navigation Aid (CNA) to the submerged REMUS AUV by means of acoustic signaling. Working in tandem with the AUV, the SHARC SRAS eliminates the need for the REMUS AUV to come to the surface for routine communications and navigation fix updates. The AUV maintains a submerged posture, while the SRAS provides updates to its navigational position, and allows over-the-horizon communications for sending back AUV position and status messages, snippets of sidescan and bathymetric data and subsequent redirection of the AUV. Current submerged AUV navigation techniques can be inaccurate as they rely on approximations resulting in imprecise location data and degraded environmental data, and require the AUVs to surface for frequent navigational fixes. This can lead to a substantially increased processing time and increased risk of missed coverage. 

SHIP MOVING VESSEL PROFILER (MVP)The Shipboard MVP is the larger shipboard complement to the HSL MVP. Intended for use from T-AGS 60 platforms, the system consists of a compact and recoverable probe integrated with a computer controlled over-the-side handling system. It permits the rapid and automated acquisition of sound velocity profile data from an underway vessel and significantly increases multibeam survey efficiency by acquiring highly accurate automated sound velocity profile data in the critical 0- 400m water layer.
 
SHIP TO SHORE DATA COMMUNICATIONS The Ship to Shore Data Communications system provides high-speed digital data communication between survey ships and the NAVOCEANO Survey Operations Center at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, using either C-band or Ku-band satellites. Real-time survey data is delivered to Non-classified Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) or Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) computers for rapid processing to produce near real-time products for the war fighter. Data is transmitted from ship to shore at nominal rate of 1,024,000 bits per second and from shore to ship at a nominal rate of 256,000 bits per second. The system also provides the survey ship with classified and unclassified email and Voice-over-IP communication. This is the sole capability which allows rapid turnaround of survey data to support the warfighter in today's highly-compressed warfighting scenarios. Life cycle OPN replacements were programmed starting in FY11.
 
TIME DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM Time is distributed via telephone, modem, Global Positioning System (GPS), Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). Funding is for distribution systems necessary to transfer and distribute time to users. This consists of receivers systems for M Code receiver systems, Two Way Satellite Time Transfer systems, Precise Time and Time Interval measuring systems, Critical Time Dissemination (CTD), NextGen Secure TWSTT, and other systems to distribute precise time. 

VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY SYSTEM Systems to be purchased here are antennas, radio receivers, Radio Frequency to digital conversion systems, wide band communication systems, and correlators to process wide-band data obtained at sites separated by thousands of kilometers. Very Long Baseline Interferometry data monitors variations in the Earth's orientation and form the basis for the fundamental celestial reference frame, and supports DoD and national requirements for Space Situational Awareness. 

AIRBORNE LIDAR SYSTEM The Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR (CZMIL) replaces the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system. CZMIL is an aircraft mounted LIDAR system used to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Routine life cycle replacement maintains technology refresh, precludes obsolescence of equipment and repair parts/maintenance, and maintains survey reliability. 

DEEP MULTIBEAM REPLACEMENT The full ocean multibeam sonar system is the primary ship-mounted ocean mapping tool used for surveys in water depths greater than 300 meters to full ocean. The deep-water multibeam system is a state-of-the-art, commercial, one-by-one degree system with a maximum swath coverage of six times water depth. The multibeam survey system includes an integrated deep water sub-bottom profiler system. The system will be installed on all T-AGS 60 class ships as a life-cycle replacement for the existing deep water multibeam system (EM121A). The deep water multibeam system (EM121A) has exceeded its life expectancy and will no longer be supported by the manufacturer. Multibeam systems collect deep-water bathymetry data required to support special chart production for the Navy. If the deep-water multibeam systems are not replaced, the T-AGS 60 ships will lose the capability to support the Navy's requirement for deep and mid-water bathymetry data products. 

SHALLOW WATER MULTIBEAM The shallow water multibeam sonar system is the primary sea-floor mapping system in the littoral (50-500 meters of water). Without this data: 1) surface and sub-surface littoral navigation charts would not be updated with accurate, high resolution bathymetry, 2) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running ocean (currents, waves, tides) models supporting anti-submarine warfare, naval special warfare and mine warfare applications would not be available and 3) high-resolution littoral bathymetry required for running acoustic models for anti-submarine warfare would not be available.
 
SHALLOW WATER SEISMIC SYSTEM Lifecycle replacement and upgrades to seismic systems are needed to meet existing requirements for geophysical measurements in shallow to mid-depth water environments. The systems will be roll-on/roll-off systems and consist of a sub-bottom profiler for medium to deep sub-bottom measurements. These systems are designed to meet requirements for geophysical measurements to support geophysical database construction. These databases are an essential part of acoustic prediction systems and support to ASW mission planning, execution, and prosecution.

NAVY PRECISION OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER SYSTEM The Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) at Anderson Mesa, Arizona is operationally producing a catalog of the precision positions of stars at a level of 16 Milli-arcseconds (mas) to meet DoD requirements for Celestial Reference Frame maintenance. NASA has transferred to the Navy four 1.8 meter telescopes to be added to the NPOI array in order to extend the catalog to fainter stars of 9th magnitude and expand the size and density of the catalog. OPN systems to be procured include precise optical and electronic equipment and infrastructure equipment used to integrate the 1.8m telescopes into NPOI array.

A2 Enterprise Virtualization GIG-Node Meteorology and Atmospheric data is a highly perishable, mission-essential element in planning for almost all operational missions performed by the United States Navy. Significant time delays in dissemination of oceanographic and meteorological products/services may add significant risk to our operational forces. This Enterprise A2 Virtualized GIG-Node will provide automatic-failover for key oceanographic and meteorological product/services in the event of a significant system/site outage.

TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO data architecture allows for distribution and processing of Precise Time, Astrometry, and Earth Orientation parameters across DoD.  Funding is for a secure network environment equipment.  This consists of switches and servers for a secure scientific network as well as switches and servers for testing of new software and products.

Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) provides an automated and efficient system capability at both Fleet Weather Centers (FWCs) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).  This system will leverage existing Navy and National Weather Service (NWS)modeling and forecast automation capabilities that will be compatible across government and civilian weather forecasting sectors. This system will analyze, interrogate, and display ensemble/deterministic models, satellite, observations, and automate repetitive forecaster tasks.  These capabilities are necessary for the commands to support mission areas including, but that are not limited to, maritime operations, aviation operations, fleet operations, and safety of navigation.

Precise Time and Astrometry Network (PTA Network) (previously funded 10OPNW TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO) is the network supporting the Master Clock at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and the Alternate Master Clock (AMC) located in Colorado Springs, CO.  The time derived from USNO, known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC (USNO)) is the primary time reference for the Department of Defense.  The network also supports USNO's determination of the Celestial Reference Frame (CRF) as well as Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP).  Together, this data provides essential mission critical information for navigation, orientation, targeting and weapons guidance, tracking of space-based platforms, and identification of space objects.  Task Force Cyber Awakening (TFCA) was established to comprehensively address cyber security across the entire Navy cyber platform.  The USNO was funded to remediate critical cyber security vulnerabilities on USNO networks, to include the PTA Network.  Funding is for equipment modernization necessary to maintain the required security posture and ensure the resiliency of the PTA Network, which is of strategic importance for the execution of tactical operations.  The PTA Network is composed of one network unit with ground sites in Washington, D.C., Colorado Springs, CO, and Flagstaff, AZ.

[P40A / Time Distribution System]: Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) - Time Distribution System: The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) provides the common time reference for all of the DOD per CJCSI 6130.01E.  USNO's primary site in Washington, DC can provide Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services to the EUCOM AOR over both Ka- and X-band satellites.  USNO's Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB, CO cannot reach the EUCOM AOR with TWSTT services. The Navy, through USNO can improve the robustness of EUCOM timing support over SATCOM channels with this one-time upgrade of satellite based timing distribution on the east coast of CONUS.

[P40A / POPS OIS]: OIS12 - Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global METOC support of the fleet. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support. The OIS Architecture OPN funding profile is the result of an IT and non-IT re-capitalization effort led by CNMOC N8 and approved by CNMOC leadership.  It has since been used as a basis for planning our IT upgrades through the FYDP.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>1.4 Fleet Survey: In FY13 2 boats were funded at a total of $1.680M.  The FY18 requests 1 boat for $0.870M.  The boats (including survey equipment) are procured based on the life cycle replacement (LCR) plan to ensure they are safe, reliable in OCONUS operating environments, and provide the necessary functionality in order to meet mission requirements at the present time. The optimal replacement time or lifecycle replacement plan is not a precise moment but is used to factor in factory warranty expirations, large maintenance costs, downtime costs, obsolesces of parts, and increased fuel consumption based on changing technologies.

Currently, Fleet Survey Team (FST) maintains four different survey platforms, which are used to conduct shallow water surveys in order to adhere to the Oceanographic, Hydrographic, and Bathymetric (OHB) requirements.  Based on FST's lifecycle replacement (LCR) plan, they need to be procured every few years in pairs due to price breaks, equipment deterioration, and other factors used to develop the LCR.  FST Platforms provide OHB data in OCONUS littoral waters. The survey mission areas are prioritized and directed by Combatant Commanders annually with subsequent changes based on emergent real world requirements. FST maintains four different survey platforms, which are used to conduct shallow water surveys in order to adhere to the OHB requirements.  

1.8 - Master Clock

These systems consist of: Rubidium (Rb) Fountain Clocks, which are advanced, non-commercial atomic clocks that are based on laser cooling and trapping of atoms; hydrogen masers; precise time measurement systems; amplifiers; and environmental conditioning systems to maintain precise temperature and humidity controls. These systems will allow for more rapid, robust and autonomous characterization of the Rubidium Fountains and Hydrogen Masers in the timing ensemble at United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Rb fountain clocks deliver the precise time and time interval required to support GPS III requirements and national assets.

The vast majority of USNO's OPN funding, across all Cost Elements, is used for the life-cycle replacement of aging equipment.  Therefore, USNO does not  typically buy/replace the same equipment each year.   While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's. 

FY16 - USNO enacted 2 contract options, $617K each.  The contract options procured 4 Steerable atomic clocks,  replacing old clocks towards the end of their usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $308K using 2 existing contracts actions, 4 Steerable clocks ($308K each) - $1.234M.  . 
 
FY17 - USNO will be replacing/upgrading the HVAC unit in the building containing the primary Master Clock System (estimated $1.5M).  This would be the major source of growth for this cost element (CE) because the HVAC does not require frequent replacement. Replace 3 Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators ($308K each) - $924K thus replacing old technology towards the end of its usable lifecycle under 1 contract.   

FY18 Replace Environmental Chambers - $775K.  The Master Clock building contains individual chambers that precisely control temperature and humidity where the atomic clocks are used operationally. Each chamber contains rubidium atoms that are laser-cooled to about the coldest temperature anything can be. The result is continued accuracy for operational needs and continuously running timepiece.

In each year, USNO is procuring different elements of the master clock system and the cost associated with these elements is different. 

1.10 OIS Architecture: Primary Oceanographic Prediction System

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.

(POPS)-Meteorology (Met) provides the key production engine enabling global METOC support of the fleet. The required technology refreshment includes enhancements of the POPS-Met hardware and software, models suite, observational data ingest capability, data distribution capability, and reach back customer support.

Increase is due to cyber security requirements mandated by the Navy, including the implementation of new shipboard missions systems that increases the requirement for computing and storage resources, new technologies that make existing equipment obsolete.  The sonar systems aboard TAG-S survey vessels have to be replaced due to equipment age such that the vendor no longer supports the equipment. The new sonar systems have greater resolution than the old systems and there are no new sonar systems available that have the resolution of the legacy equipment and software. This lifecycle replacement of the sonar systems results in increased data volume and the need for increased computational power to process and store the data.

1.12 - The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) 

The Primary Oceanographic Prediction System (POPS) and Oceanographic Information System (OIS)FY18-22 funding was transferred to SPAWAR.

It was established circa 1996 as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IA Acquisition Program in order to provide scientific computing capability for oceanography and meteorology.  The POPS-Met Deputy Program Manager (DPM) is responsible for that portion of the POPS fielded at the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN).  In accordance with the POPS-Met System Integration Master Plan (SIMP), the storage, networking, and compute nodes/memory are replaced on a four year cycle. High Performance Computing (HPC) nodes with on-board memory are more expensive and have a higher associated cost in years two and three; network components and storage are replaced in year one and four at a lower overall cost. 

Unit price varies year to year because in order to sustain the state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) environment and support the increasing capabilities of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model.  The below illustrates the need for processors, memory, storage, and networks:

- Replacing End of Life (EoL) HPC servers containing 12 CPUs/32GB RAM with next-generation HPC servers containing 32 CPUs/128GB RAM is more expensive, and it fits in the same rack space.  This does not increase server count, but increases system capability to meet NWP operational demands.

- Replacing EoL 120TB or online storage with 600TB of online storage (to account for the improved NWP models being support) is more expensive, and fits in the same rack space.

- Replacing EoL 1Gb network components with next-generation 10Gb network components (to move all that addition NWP data around the system) is more expensive and fits in the same rack space.

- Replacing EoL, and adding additional, system security management components with next-generation, and highly secure, system management components, is required to meet new Cyber Security requirements.

1.15 - Time Distribution System

The vast majority of USNO's OPN funding, across all Cost Elements, is used for the life-cycle replacement of aging equipment.  Therefore, USNO does not  typically buy/replace the same equipment each year.   While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's. 

FY16 - USNO invested in new GPSIII technology that could improve the distribution of GPS data.  

FY17 - USNO will be installing and testing the new technology to understand the benefits/shortfalls of the new technology, but will make no new procurements.

FY18 - Based on findings funded with FY17 RDT&amp;E, USNO will commit to the new modem technology or be forced to replace aging modems currently being used.

Increase between FY17 and FY18 is due to USNO implementing new technology to understand the benefits and shortfalls of the newly procured technology from FY16. There is no procurement scheduled for the time distribution system in FY17. In FY18, USNO is procuring a new modem technology to distribute the GPS III signal to keep up with military requirements. The unit price is different because USNO is not procuring any requirements relating to time distribution system in FY17. 

1.17 Laser Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR): 

The Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR replaces the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total
Survey (CHARTS) system. CZMIL is an aircraft mounted LIDAR system used to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Routine life cycle
replacement maintains technology refresh, precludes obsolescence of equipment and repair parts/maintenance, and maintains survey reliability.  

The Airborne Coastal System (ACS) meets COCOM High Priority Safety of Navigation hydrographic requirements.  These requirements are validated, vetted and prioritized by COCOMs through the Oceanographic, Hydrographic, Bathymetric survey requirements program (OPNAVINST 3140.55B).  LIDAR system is needed to continue the Navy's effort to rapidly and simultaneously collecting hydrographic and topographic data through state-of-the-art sensors installed in a modified DC-3 aircraft (contract aircraft) via ACS.  ACS survey capability is well suited for very shallow operational requirements compared to T-AGS survey ships.  The ACS supports COCOM and other Naval Component requirements for highly efficient collection capability and Theatre Security Cooperation tool.  Funding supports procurement of a Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LIDAR (CZMIL) aircraft mounted LIDAR system necessary to conduct expeditionary and rapid response hydrographic surveys in near-shore areas and areas inaccessible by ship or survey launch. Due to the singular nature of the Airborne LIDAR platform, the lifecycle replacement (LCR) plan only occurs every several years, thus requiring a replacement system in FY18.  The last system was procured in FY10.  

2.1 (formerly 1.23) Precision Time and Astrometry Network (United States Naval Observatory)

FY18 funds (FY17 funds are under TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING USNO) are for PTA Network modifications which are necessary to enhance and maintain the required security of the network. The increase in funds from FY17 to FY18 are due to the higher unit cost of the required hardware and software modifications planned in FY18.  The PTA Network modernization was initially funded in FY16 with funds from TASK FORCE CYBER AWAKENING due to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) determination that the USNO scientific IT network showed technical obsolescence as well as critical cyber and physical vulnerabilities.

In FY 2017, a decrease in Environmental Support Equipment OPN by $0.891M was required for us to to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

OCO: 
$1M OCO request associated with the European Reassurance Initiative and will support an X-band "hop station" on the east coast of CONUS to relay Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services from the Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB to the EUCOM AOR. This is for Cape Canaveral, where USNO already has TWSTT operations in support of local missions. This will increase the robustness of the highest level timing support into EUCOM by allowing failover to the alternate authoritative timing source for the DOD.

The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) provides the common time reference for all of the DOD per CJCSI 6130.01E.  USNO's primary site in Washington, DC can provide Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services to the EUCOM AOR over both Ka- and X-band satellites.  USNO's Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB, CO cannot reach the EUCOM AOR with TWSTT services. The Navy, through USNO can improve the robustness of EUCOM timing support over SATCOM channels with this one-time upgrade of satellite based timing distribution on the east coast of CONUS.</proc:Justification>

Therefore, USNO does not typically buy/replace the same equipment each year.  While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's.   FY16 - USNO enacted 2 contract options, $618K each.  The contract options procured 4 Steerable  atomic clocks, replacing old clocks towards the end of their usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $309K using 2 existing contracts actions.    FY17 - USNO will be replacing/upgrading the HVAC unit in the building containing the primary Master Clock System (estimated $1.5M) and purchase 3 Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillators, replacing old technology towards the end of its usable lifecycle, at a unit price of approximately $308K using 1 contract.  FY18 Replace Environmental Chambers - $775K.  The Master Clock building contains individual chambers that precisely control temperature and humidity where the atomic clocks are used operationally. Each chamber contains rubidium atoms that are laser-cooled to about the coldest temperature anything can be. The result is continued accuracy for operational needs and continuously running timepiece.  In each year, USNO is procuring different elements of the master clock system and the cost associated with these elements is different.">1.8) Master Clock Systems</proc:Name>

Therefore, USNO does not  typically buy/replace the same equipment each year.   While it may look like the costs are increasing, USNO is actually replacing different underlying components described in the description of each Cost Element description in the P-40.  Also, please note that the quantity is also misleading when comparing across FY's.   FY16 - USNO invested in new GPSIII technology that could improve the distribution of GPS data.   FY17 - USNO will be installing and testing the new technology to understand the benefits/shortfalls of the new technology, but will make no new procurements. FY18 - In FY18, USNO is procuring a new modem technology to distribute the GPS III signal. Additionally, increase of $1M OCO is associated with the European Reassurance Initiative and will support an X-band &quot;hop station&quot; on the east coast of CONUS to relay Two Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT) services from the Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB to the EUCOM AOR. This is for Cape Canaveral, where USNO already has TWSTT operations in support of local missions.

                                    <proc:Name footnote="The eight (8) HPC systems supported by the POPS-Met program, to include NIPRnet-connect Unclassified clusters (Operational, Test/Beta, and Integration/Alpha), SIPRnet-connected Secret clusters (Operational, Test/Beta, and Integration/Alpha), and JWICS-connected Top Secret clusters (Operational and Test/Beta) are comprised of 1500+ servers (11,000+ CPUs), 800+ Terabytes (TBs) of online storage, 100+ Petabytes of offline storage, and 100+ networking components, to include routers, switches, and firewalls.  This is a complicated, unique, one-of-a-kind HPC computing infrastructure, owned and operated by the Department of the Navy.  In keeping with DoD and POPS guidelines, the OPN budget for lifecycle replacement due to equipment obsolescence, End-of-Life/End-of-Support (EoL/EoS) issues, and new technology insertion, was planned assuming a 3-4 year replacement cycle, with 25-30% of the system components replaced each year without increasing the server footprint.  Replacing the E! oL/EoS POPS-Met system components with state-of-the-art HPC computing technology, low-latency data storage required to meet NWP processing needs, and the high-speed (40Gbs expanding to 100Gbs) network connections between the computing and storage components is both complicated and expensive; new generations of HPC equipment and infrastructure components are required to meet the expanding FLENUMMETOCCEN mission while addressing ever more stringent cyber security requirements.  In accordance with the POPS-Met System Integration Master Plan (SIMP), the storage, networking, and compute nodes/memory are replaced on a four year cycle. High Performance Computing (HPC) nodes with on-board memory are more expensive and have a higher associated cost in years two and three; network components and storage are replaced in year one and four at a lower overall cost.   In order to sustain the state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) environment and support the increasing capabilities of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, the below illustrates the need for processors, memory, storage, and networks: -- Replacing End of Life (EoL) HPC servers containing 12 CPUs/32GB RAM with next-generation HPC servers containing 32 CPUs/128GB RAM is more expensive, and it fits in the same rack space.  This does not increase server count, but increases system capability to meet NWP operational demands. -- Replacing EoL 120TB or online storage with 600TB of online storage (to account for the improved NWP models being support) is more expensive, and fits in the same rack space. -- Replacing EoL 1Gb network components with next-generation 10Gb network components (to move all that addition NWP data around the system) is more expensive and fits in the same rack space. -- Replacing EoL, and adding additional, system security management components with next-generation, and highly secure, system management components, is required to meet new Cyber Security requirements.">1.26) POPS OIS</proc:Name>

The funds support the following six categories:  Electronic Harbor Security Systems (EHSS) and Barriers; Physical Security/Access Control (Gates Automation &amp; Perimeter Security); MILCON IDS; Command, Control, Computer, Communications &amp; Intelligence (C4I) and Other Physical Security Equipment (PSE).

[P40A / VACIS]: Ports of Jebel Ali and Fujairah lack capability to screen cargo for explosives or contraband, an identified Force Protection vulnerability. The Vehicle and Contraband Inspection Systems (VACIS) GT is a rugged, highly mobile scanning system. Capable of detecting explosives and illegal contraband in vehicles and cargo containers. Typically used to scan large commercial vehicles during entry control point operations by combat forces in austere environments.

[P40A / ZBV Military Trailer]: 2 x ZBV Military Trailer - ZBV-MIL-TRAILER-01 (Z Backscatter Van Military Mobile Trailer) gamma ray imager.  Capable of detecting explosives and illegal contraband in vehicles and cargo containers.  Typically used to scan large commercial vehicles during entry control point operations by combat forces in austere environments.

[P40A / Counter UAS Technology]: The Corian Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) solution is a precision system designed to protect high value assets and support public safety against threats posed by the inadvertent or unlawful misuse of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  Corian accurately and reliable detects, identifies, tracks, and mitigates UAV threats and is widely applicable to protecting Naval infrastructure and installations.  The system provides continuous, automated monitoring, 24x7, in all weather conditions, and it has the unique ability to identify and locate both the UAV and its ground controller operator. Corian's passive UAV detection capability creates an electronic perimeter boundary around sensitive locations to protect Navy's high value, high interest infrastructures.  This UAS detection, identification, and tracking system uses UAS radio links to precisely identify and locate systems flying in banned or protected airspace, i.e. sensitive Navy installation areas.  This funding is required to procure hardware, perform site engineering studies, provide system design, deploy and install the system, and provide operator training, to include Tier 1 maintenance.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Mobile Security Force-Active
Increase for procurement of Hailing Acoustic Laser and Light Tactical System (HALLTS) and Long Range Ocular Interrupter (LROI) for Coastal Riverine Forces (CRF) and procurement of Combatant Craft Forward-Looking Infrared (CCFLIR) sensors for the MK VI Patrol Boat.

Mobile Security Force-Reserve
Increase is to update AN/PVS-15 (night vision binoculars) with Wide Field of View (WFOV) goggle system and procurement of M2WS Thermal Weapons Sights that will provide increased situational awareness for low light/night time small boat and tactical convoy operations.

SSBN Waterfront Restricted Area Security (WRAS)
The decrease is attributable to the last year of procurement for; Common Limited Area (LA) Electronic Security System (ESS) Refresh Security Designs (SD) at Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic (SWFLANT), Kings Bay, Georgia and Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific (SWFPAC), Bangor, Washington, Limited Area Production and Storage Complex (LAPSC) ESS Refresh SD at SWFPAC, and Land Water Interface (LWI) ESS procurements, installations and testing at SWFLANT. The FY 2018 funding request will support the Land Water Interface (LWI) ESS procurements, installations and testing at SWFPAC and the procurement and installation of the Waterfront Restricted Area (WRA) Card Readers. These projects are critical to protecting the Strategic Weapons Facilities and ensuring there is no unauthorized access to nuclear weapons.

Enhanced Maritime Interception Operations (EMIO)
Increase is for procurement of next generation Hand-Held Explosive Detector (HHED) for Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection (ATFP) and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) platforms.

Naval Special Warfare
Increase reflects establishment, approval and funding of NSW service-common Table Of Allowance to begin correcting shortfalls and bring NSW forces into alignment with required outfitting standards in accordance with SOCOM-USN Memorandum of Agreement.  The FY18 increase is based on the development, review, validation, and approval of NSW Service-Common Table of Allowance (TOA). The increase in OPN accounts for costs related to the transition of RQ-20 PUMA Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) from MFP-11 to MFP-2 funding. The transition is required in accordance with the US Navy / SOCOM MOA and ensures compliance with Anti-deficiency Act (ADA) provisions.

Anti-Terrorism Force Protection Ashore
Increase due to the replacement of Mass Notification Systems that are at end of life.  This capability was directed via legislative mandate resulting from the SECDEF Fort Hood working group.

FY 2018 C4I funding will provide for:

Regional Dispatch Center ($10.8M):
Provides Regionalized/Consolidated emergency call receipt, alarm monitoring, and 1st responder dispatching, Utilize centrally-hosted and supported Computer Aided Dispatch, Mobile Data Computers, Records Management Systems, Geographic Information System (GIS), Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR), and Alarm Automation to optimize emergency communication and response times.

Giant Voice / Indoor Voice ($10.3M):
Provides Voice Alerts and Notifications during Emergency Events affecting an installation.                   

Navy Munitions Alarm System ($3.6M): 
Equipment and components for Conventional Arms, Ammunitions &amp; Explosives (AA&amp;E) systems supporting Category I/II munitions. 

Cost Elements 13.1 - 13.4 Counter UAS Technology addresses JEON:
C-sUAS JEON is in response to the U.S. Strategic Command Joint Emergent Operational Need Statement, ST-0008, dtd 25Jul16.  The rapid deployment capability (RDC) plan is to deploy CORIAN C-UAS systems at both NB Kitsap-Bangor and NSB King's Bay.  Recent UAV sightings over several Naval installations comes at a time when the U.S. military is scrambling to improve defenses against the rapidly evolving capabilities of remote-controlled devices. With UAVs increasingly becoming more readily available and affordable, the threat of inadvertent or unlawful flight over restricted spaces multiplies infinitely raising concern that these UAVs could be used as tools for surveillance, espionage, or hostile actions at critical Navy installations.  The RDC effort also extends to the blocking vessels that escort submarines to the 100-fathom dive point and justifies the procurement of the mobile sites.  Request includes funding for required for Program Management support, systems engineering, operational and safety testing to include targets and facility costs including electrical upgrades, new towers and network management.

Cost Element 13.5 Counter Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS) (+$10M) is a follow-on effort to procure systems for critical Naval installations.  More details available at a higher classification level.

FY 2017 decrease in Physical Security Equipment OPN by $4.240M as required for the Department of the Navy to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

            <proc:Description>Distance Support: A Navy Enterprise effort that combines people, processes and technology into a collaborative infrastructure without regard to geographic location. Distance Support (DS) is comprised of the following three components: Infrastructure, Content and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Infrastructure provides the "transport" of DS applications and data to and from operating units and shore installations in support of various processes. Technology infrastructure also includes the data replication and shipboard IT servers that bring the DS functionality to the sailor. Content includes specific applications, systems and processes produced by various Navy communities of Interest. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) capabilities include the "Navy 311" Website, BMC Remedy Software, Shared Data Environment, Business Intelligence and Predictive Modeling software, Avaya telephony and Call Management System, and the Navy 311 Support Center, which is the hub of Distance Support, providing the single point of entry for support requests for fleet customers on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year basis (24/7/365).  The Navy Information Application Product Suite (NIAPS) is comprised of integrated hardware and GOTS software that coalesce various workstations, storage, servers, applications and content into a common environment for shipboard deployment.  NIAPS provides data compression and replication capability and is designed to re-host typically shore/web-based applications afloat to minimize bandwidth and provide maximum capability.  NIAPS is comprised of nearly 40 applications and databases launched from a single Distance Support (DS) Portal on NIAPS server. NIAPS runs applications specifically tailored to individual afloat units for training, career management, maintenance, technical drawings, logistics, human resources, as well as morale and welfare support (Quality of life) which are produced by various Navy functional organizations. NIAPS gives a ship access to critical applications and data using internal shipboard networks, which is faster and cheaper than using external bandwidth and satellite time.
  
Risk Management Information: RMI program initiates transition of existing legacy and core safety programs and risk management systems, applications and data into a single Program of Record (POR). RMI capability consists of four distinct safety capabilities:  Streamlined Incident Reporting (SIR), Single Point of Entry (SPOE), Safety Program Management(SPM) and Analysis &amp; Dissemination (A&amp;D). 

Data Center Consolidation (DCC): DCC procures and installs data center hardware, software, and licenses for established Navy Enterprise Data Centers (NEDCs) and other approved hosting locations as part of the Department of Defense's Information Technology efficiency to consolidate and standardize the Navy's Data Center footprint. DCC utilizes architecture, standards, and data strategy for enterprise solutions that leverage economies of scale for the consolidation of Navy Data Centers across the Department of the Navy. Oversight and execution of all DCC efforts are under the direction of Data Center and Application Optimization (DCAO) under Program Executive Office - Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS).

Telephony Suite Replacement and Modernization:
The Department of Defense (DoD), Chief Information Officer (CIO) Memorandum of 5 November 2015 "DoD CIO Capability Priorities for Fiscal Years 2018-2022" lists as a priority, the modernization of network infrastructure to be regionally based, centrally managed and cyber secure. This includes migrating existing infrastructure from Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to Internet Protocol (IP) based communications to enable Unified Capabilities (UC). Telephony procures and integrates Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software to meet the DoD-CIO TDM to IP mandate for the Navy. All efforts are performed in accordance with policy and procedures set forth in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8100.03, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212.01 and CJCSI 6215.01D and DoD Unified Capabilities Requirement 2013. Program requirements include: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Voice over Secure Internet Protocol (VoSIP), Video Teleconferencing over Secure Internet Protocol (VTCoSIP), Telephony Unified Messaging System (TUMS), Regional Telephony Management System (RTMS), Navy Video Conferencing System (NVCS), NVCS Coalition (NVCS-C), Internet Protocol (IP) Trunking, Aegis Ashore, and Telephony systems infrastructure (e.g. cable plant). Telephony system installations and/or upgrades occur at facilities in accordance with requirements as identified by Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) (i.e. FLTNOCs, Fleet Telecommunications sites, and Aegis Ashore Sites).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature will be called Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS in FY18.  NMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract and will be executed out of LI 8164. Funding for NMCI OCONUS has been transferred to LI 8164 beginning in FY18.  This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model.

Distance Support: In FY18, Distance Support Customer Relationship Management (DS-CRM) funds the procurement of new BMC Remedy Licenses (to support growth and use of Remedy and Shared Data Environment) for both NIPR and SIPR, Optimal Identity Management Licenses (Centralized and automated CAC authentication and authorization for all NAVY 311 applications), Hardware costs (for increased storage capacity at NEDC NOLA in support of growth of the Shared Data Environment caused by increased NAVY partnering and usage), and all the associated labor for the implementation, optimization, configuration, and integration of the listed software and hardware in environment.  FY18 also funds the procurement of Microsoft Windows 2012 and SQL Server 2012 licenses to support installation of NIAPS V3.0.  NIAPS V3.0 replaces NIAPS 2.4.X, which utilizes end-of-life software that is not PKI compliant, and meets newly established cybersecurity requirements to include renewal of ATOs within the RMF.  

Data Center Consolidation (DCC): In FY18, OPN funding will procure servers (encompassing both hardware and software components), ancillary equipment associated with the servers (racks, cables, switches, etc.), and integration and installation efforts as needed to meet additional hosting requirements as consolidated applications are hosted in approved hosting locations, and as a part of regular data center technical refresh. Regular technical refresh is required to maintain cyber security readiness and accreditation at the data centers under DCAO's purview.

Telephony Suite Replacement and Modernization:  In FY18, the program will continue procurement and installation of Internet Protocol (IP)- based equipment in support of DoD's Everything over IP (EoIP) mandate and Telephony requirements including: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Voice over Secure Internet Protocol (VoSIP), Video Teleconferencing over Secure Internet Protocol (VTCoSIP), Telephony Unified Messaging System (TUMS), Regional Telephony Management System (RTMS), Navy Video Conferencing System (NVCS), NVCS Coalition (NVCS-C), Internet Protocol (IP) Trunking, Aegis Ashore, and Telephony systems infrastructure (e.g. cable plant). Telephony system installations and/or upgrades occur at facilities in accordance with requirements as identified by Navy Information Forces (NAVIFOR), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) (i.e. FLTNOCs, Fleet Telecommunications sites, and Aegis Ashore Sites).

FY18-FY22 procurement and installation unit cost variances are based on the location of the region/site (CONUS,OCONUS), number of sites in the region, the various site architectures and requirements, the age and type of systems modernized, and user density (number of users). 
  
Telephony quantities represent the number of regions that are being replaced/modernized in the given Fiscal Year (FY). Each region has numerous sites with unit and installation costs varying based on the location of the region/site (CONUS,OCONUS), number of sites in the region, the various site architectures and requirements, the age and type of systems modernized, and user density (number of users). Regions: CONUS: Southwest, Pacific Northwest, Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic. OCONUS: Western Pacific, Guantanamo, Europe, Middle East - Installation schedule reflects 6 months of integration and PITCO after delivery and prior to installation.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is the acquisition approach and contract vehicle used to manage the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) enterprise network which will provide secure, net-centric data and services to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and represents the continuous evolution of information technology at the Department of Navy (DoN). Additionally NGEN provides security for the non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (known as NIPRNET) and the classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET).  NIPRNET is a private IP network used to exchange unclassified information, including information subject to controls on distribution, among the private network's users.  SIPRNET is a system of interconnected computer networks used to transmit classified information (up to and including information classified SECRET) by packet switching over the "completely secure environment."  NGEN forms the foundation for the DoN's future Naval Network Environment that will be interoperable with and leverage other Department of Defense-provided Net-Centric Enterprise Services.  

The Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature will be called the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS beginning in FY18, realigning funding from 8161 to 8164.  NMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract. This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model.

[P5 / NGEN - Technical Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP)]: Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP):  TRMP is a requirement performed by Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) which focuses on upgrading the existing Hardware and or Software to mitigate End of Life, End of Support and End of Software Support issues in order to maintain network performance, Architecture/Solution Accreditations and network security.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H/W and/or S/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS and ORT) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.

The Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature will be called Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS in FY18.  NMCI OCONUS is a DoN initiative to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end information and telecommunication services to OCONUS Navy shore commands by using a common computing environment for both the NIPRNet and SIPRNet. NMCI OCONUS will provide the infrastructure and cyber security measures to support the OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-Net), and the operations of ONE-Net. NMCI OCONUS also includes ONE-Net installations supporting the presidential directed initiative for Ballistic Missile Defense Aegis Ashore capability in designated countries (e.g. Romania, Poland), as well as Piers IT infrastructure to support connectivity for Naval ships world-wide at pier side (CONUS and OCONUS).  ONE-Net will continue operating under the government owned/government operated (GO/GO) business model and will transition to the NGEN GO/CO support structure and operating model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract in FY18.  Consequently, the NGEN TRMP funding will be used to refresh the common global Naval Enterprise Network (combined NGEN CONUS and OCONUS).

[P5 / NGEN - Operation Rolling Tide / Cyber Resiliency]: Operation Rolling Tide (ORT) is an initiative developed in response to the on-going improvement of the Navy Marine Corps Intranet security posture through the following mechanisms:  Account Hardening, Server/Workstation Hardening, Network Compartmentalization, Network Management Enhancements, Application Protection Enhancements, Security Analysis and Fusion Capabilities, Cyber Situational Awareness (Cyber Sensor Grid) Improvements, Cyber Terrain Mapping, and Cyber Terrain Hardening.  The ORT projects will result in a more robust and secure network with the goal of better real time detection and response to any malicious activity.  In FY18 and beyond, ORT will be integrated into the ongoing Cyber Resiliency program and will compliment key Cyber initiatives such as CYBERSAFE, Risk Management Framework (RMF), Navy Cyber Situational Awareness (NCSA) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE) as the network migrates toward a Cloud operating model, as well as refreshed as a part of TRMP.

[P5 / NGEN- Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS)]: The Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) is a Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative that consolidates Cybersecurity control points for the Department of Defense (DoD) and mission support organizations.  JRSS will replace the existing Navy cyber protection boundaries allowing for a common and operable cyber defense network across all of the DoD.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>NMCI OCONUS (BLII) funding was realigned from LI 8161 to 8164 beginning in FY18 and incorporated into the Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) line.

The Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) nomenclature from LI 8161, will be called the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) OCONUS.  

NMCI OCONUS, along with related US Navy Pier side infrastructure, will transition to the NGEN business model upon the award of the NGEN follow-on contract.  This will allow the Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) to function as common global network, through the institution of a single approved service operating model in conjunction with the current Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) network.  In essence, the CONUS and OCONUS networks are intended to merge into a single allocated baseline as part of the NGEN Re-compete contract.  

NMCI OCONUS funding will provide technical refresh of existing antiquated network equipment allowing for the refresh of 2,000+ network devices that have reached end of life/support and now present security risks to the network, along with 9,000+ antiquated PCs which will be at the end of their warranty.  It will also provide the required systems/security engineering and integration, production, installation and implementation of hardware and software in support of the transition of ONE-NET into NMCI.  This will result in a fully integrated, navy network with NIPR (unclassified) and SIPR (classified) enclaves operated via a controlled common operational approach.  Additionally FY18 funding will be used to upgrade existing End of Life (EOL) infrastructure (routers, switches, servers, etc.) for one CONUS PIERS region (Atlantic Southeast) and two OCONUS PIERS locations (Korea and Singapore).  This technical refresh will also allow for the transition of the OCONUS Enterprise Pier Connectivity Architecture, into a single global network under the next NGEN contract.

Technology Refresh and Modernization Plan (TRMP) involves the modernization and periodic replacement of NMCI hardware/software and assigned non-IT assets identified in the NGEN TRMP plan required to support network performance.  The objective of TRMP is to improve and maintain network performance, increase network capacity based on project demand, improve security posture from vulnerabilities and integrate DoD and/or DoN mandates.  NGEN assets are Government Owned/Contractor Operated (GO/CO).  A significant  amount of those assets have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported by the vendors, which makes our infrastructure vulnerable to external cyber-attacks; and diminishes enterprise solutions performance and optimization.  Our current infrastructure is aged and modernization is essential to improve storage capabilities to accommodate new emerging workforce requirements; maintain network performance, architecture/solution accreditations, and network security.  The procurement of these assets will continue in FY18 and beyond.  TRMP also allows the NEN program to insert and or augment new technology solutions (H/W and/or S/W) to meet evolving requirements (e.g. JRSS and ORT) and keep closer pace with industry advancements.Hence, future TRMP funding will be utilized to transition to 10GB networks.  The final phase of ORT cybersecurity enhancements were procured in FY16 for deployment in FY17.  Therefore, beginning in FY18, previously deployed ORT components that become obsolete will be refreshed as part of TRMP to maintain the security posture of the network, which will become part of the baseline for the follow-on NGEN contract.  New and advanced cyber security efforts, not included in the NGEN Re-compete baseline, will leverage Cyber Resiliency funding.  

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) scope which included JRSS was laid out broadly in a series of Joint Chiefs of Staff Tank and Deputy Secretary Management Action Group (DMAG) decisions in 2012.  DoD CIO, via the JIE EXCOM, has further refined the priorities of those tasks, consistent with the implementation strategy.  JRSS is DoD's near term modernization priority, and is fielded as an Enterprise Service, as designated by the DoD CIO in November 2015.  With the designation of JRSS as an Enterprise Service, the DoD CIO required JRSS be separately identified within the DoD FY17 President's IT Budget submission.

The funding supports the planning, engineering and movement of Navy Networks behind the Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS) through firewall functionality, intrusion detection and prevention, enterprise management, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF), and other network security capabilities. This OSD JRSS initiative comprises several critical Joint Information Environment capabilities including network modernization, initial implementation of a single security architecture, joint management of DoD IT security, and improvements to cyber-security situational awareness.  JRSS transforms the network security, aligning the DoD Components to a common capability, which significantly improves DoD mission effectiveness through situational awareness visibility for all echelons within DoD.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>OPN-8 Budget Activity (BA-08) funds Spares and Repair parts identified in Budget Activities (BA 01-07), which are required during the Interim pre-MSD period in support of Initial and Vendor Direct spares requirements, and Outfitting Spares requirements during the post MSD period. The interim period accounts for the initial material support requirements, i.e Installation and Check-Out Initial (INCO-I), Installation and Check-Out Replenishment (INCO-R), On board Repair Parts (OBRPs), and Maintenance Assistance Modules (MAMs). These spares funds procure repairable and consumable items to be provided to active ships, shore sites and expeditionary units for installation and maintenance of new equipment/capabilities and modernization /upgrades financed in OPN BAs 1-7.    Vendor Direct material requirements acquired in the interim period supports the Depot turn-a-round, and Depot through put capabilities for Appropriation Procurement Accounts. The Outfitting period funds and supports authorized Allowance Change Requests (ACRs), Range and Depth increases, Modernization to support new/upgraded equipment installs, Maintenance Changes to previously Installed equipment, as well as CNO directed availabilities and RCOH efforts. 

OPN-8 funding additionally provides for the Initial lay in of Shore Based support requirements in support of Expeditionary Combat Forces and EOD units approved by OPNAV as appropriate.

The DoN has instituted numerous initiatives to better equip the Fleet and improve the execution of this line.  Flag and SES level Spares Summits or Executive Spares Reviews are now held on monthly basis.  In addition, integrated product teams were formed to deep dive estimation models and schedules of program requirements.  Bi-weekly Spares Execution Working Group Updates are held between Resource Sponsors, BSO's and other Navy leadership.</proc:Description>

Initial Spares

0840 / Sub Periscope, Imaging and Supt Equip Prog - (Combined narrative for initial and replenishment) (Initial) Increase in spares line is as a result of the new Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM).  The design of the mast is modular to enable it to be taken apart if a sub section does not pass all testing during the installation.  Spare subsections of the new mast need to be available as INCO items if there is a failure so the subsection can be replaced.  There are also a small QTY of parts that will be ordered to repair the failed subsection.  (

            <proc:Description>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) connects all users to each other from theater down to the maneuver battalion, to joint and multinational elements, and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). WIN-T employs a combination of terrestrial, airborne, and satellite-based transport options, to provide robust, redundant connectivity. Network modernization is one of the Army's top priorities, and WIN-T is its cornerstone program. It enables mission command on the move, keeping highly mobile and dispersed forces connected to one another and to the Army's global information network. With essential voice, video and data services, commanders can make decisions faster than ever before and from anywhere on the battlefield. WIN-T's infrastructure provides commanders and other users the ability to communicate via voice, data, and video simultaneously at all levels of security.  

Warfighter Information Network- Tactical (WIN-T) Increment (Inc) 1: Networking At-the-Halt
A state-of-the-art, Beyond Line of Sight, at-the-halt communications network that ensures operational relevancy and interoperability with future increments. It provides the current Warfighter with communications backbone that enables them to exchange information (voice, data, and video) at high speeds with high reliability throughout the tactical Division, Brigade Combat Team (BCT), and Battalion level elements using a wired and wireless backbones for the tactical Network Operations Centers (NOC) The wireless solution leverages the National Security Agency approved Commercial for Classified Systems (CfSC) architecture within the Operations Centers allowing simple and quick deployment of the NOC equipment and  C2 applications.   Two sub-increments are noted as follows: (Increment 1a): Extended Networking at-the-Halt - with Ka military satellite communications capability; and (Increment 1b): Enhanced Networking at-the-Halt, building on the Increment 1a capability by adding the Net Centric Waveform (NCW) and the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) compliant Colorless Core Capability.  The NCW is essential to provide a meshed satellite network, minimizing latency through multiple hops at the below brigade HQs and the DoDIN compliant Colorless Core Capability  allows an efficient transport of multiple classified and unclassified data streams between WIN-T Inc 1 and Inc 2, as well as to reach back hub facilities. The  Increment 1 architecture is an integral part of the converged Network Operations (NETOPS) initiative allowing common NETOPS from any WIN-T assemblage.  Regional Hub Nodes are the uppermost level of the tactical architecture which provides a sanctuary, overlapping global presence that all WIN-T increments and product lines can leverage for transport services.  


WIN-T Increment 2: Initial Networking On-the-Move
Warfighter Information Network (WIN-T) Increment 2 (Inc 2) provides the Army with On-The-Move (OTM) networking capability.  The WIN-T Inc 2 network retains capabilities delivered by WIN-T Inc 1 and by leveraging proven government and commercial technologies, adds greater network throughput and automated Network Management to optimize planning (to include spectrum use), initialization, monitoring and troubleshooting. WIN-T Inc 2 employs Satellite Communications (SATCOM) OTM to extend the network in maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) to Company level through FY18.  Using equipment mounted on combat platforms, WIN-T Inc 2 delivers a mobile capability that reduces reliance on fixed infrastructure and allows key leaders to move on the battlefield while retaining Situational Awareness and Mission Command capabilities. Using the Highband Networking Radio, with the Highband Networking Waveform and high performance antennas, the WIN-T Inc 2 Line-of-Sight network offers an adaptive 30 Megabit per second (Mbps) aggregate throughput to key leaders in their Command Post or in their vehicle. The WIN-T Inc 2 network is self-forming, which means that it automatically creates transmission paths based on terrain and environmental conditions; and self-healing, meaning that the paths will automatically re-route traffic to complete network transactions and calls even if one or more nodes break down or loses connectivity.  This offers greater network reliability and better end-to-end connectivity than traditional point-to-point networks.  WIN-T Inc 2 introduces the network management capability needed to keep the mobile and dispersed forces networked together through automated planning, initialization, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  Finally, WIN-T Inc 2 adopts "Colorless Core" technology that encrypts both classified and unclassified user information in the network and minimizes the number of users on the "core" of the network.  The Colorless Core allows commanders to utilize the tactical network without fear of the enemy intercepting information. Colorless Core is a technical insertion in the WIN-T Inc 1b network which enables information sharing between WIN-T Inc 1b and WIN-T Inc 2.

The WIN-T Inc 2 capabilities are identified for fielding to Armored, Infantry, and Stryker BCTs, Fires and CABs and Division Headquarters.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node have both satellite and Line-of-Sight communication capability.  The Soldier Network Extension (SNE) provides satellite communication only.  The Point of Presence and the Tactical Communications Node are deployed at Division, Brigade and Battalion echelons. The SNE serves as the S3 vehicle at Battalion level and is also deployed down to Company level through FY18, when Network Capability Review (NCR) removes SNEs from the Company Commanders.  
 
WIN-T Inc 3 developed NetOps and NetCentric Waveform (NCW) updates will be inserted into WIN-T Increment 2 equipped units.

Area Common User System Modernization (ACUS MOD): 
Supports the Bridge to Future Networks (BFN) systems architecture by providing items to modernize the network or tech refresh existing legacy equipment.  ACUS Mod supports the Army's Transformation/Modularity initiatives by developing, procuring, and fielding product improvements into the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and 24 Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs).  Also provides support to those systems that were fielded under the Area Common User System Modernization Plan (ACUS MP).  Overall, ACUS Mod supports the Army's mission by providing Ethernet local area network communications between Tactical Operational Centers (TOC); TOC &amp; Tactical Internet network management capabilities; integrated voice, video and data services; Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) transmission capability.

The ACUS Mod systems consist of: the High Capacity Line of Sight (HCLOS/AN/TRC-190) radio which provides a 16 Mbps line of site transmission capability required to transport the increased volume of data on the digital battlefield; the Battlefield Video-Teleconferencing Center (BVTC) provides Video Teleconference (VTC) and data collaboration to assist the commander in coordinating and interacting with different echelons and adjacent units; the AN/TRC-170 tropospheric scatter radio which provides Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) communications with ranges in excess of 100 miles and bandwidth of up to 16 Mbps; and the Single Shelter Switch (SSS) which provides commanders with a "First In" capability and building block for network expansion.  The SSS is enhanced to provide Joint and Coalition interoperability using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf and Government-Off-The-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) architecture for technology upgrade ease.  The aforementioned systems are an integral part of the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 system architecture.  The Tactical NetOps Management System (TNMS) is a scalable modular NetOps capability that operates on multiple client or server platforms.  It is fielded to units not provided with WIN-T Inc 1 NetOps capabilities.  The TNMS will facilitate decision-making necessary to quickly identify network problems, shift resources, change configurations and coordinate the management of the critical network infrastructure supporting Mission Command (MC)/Command and Control (C2) functions.  

These systems will be fielded to WIN-T Inc 1 units according to the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) schedule. WIN-T is fielded to the maneuver BCTs, multifunctional Support Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Expeditionary Signal Batellions.  Currently, all of those elements will be fielded WIN-T Inc 1b by 1QFY17 except for those already fielded WIN-T Inc 2.  WIN-T Inc 2 is currently fielded to fourteen BCTs and seven Divisions. WIN-T Inc 2 will be fielded to all maneuver BCTs and Divisions.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $420.492 million supports WIN-T Increment 2 requirements below: 

WIN-T Inc 2: FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $420.492 million procures 61 communications nodes (30 TCNs, 31 PoPs) and 816 other Configuration Items for fielding to 3 BCTs, 1 Division, and 3 IBCT Eng Co and Mvr Bn.  FY 2018 funds will also continue to field and support previously procured assets.

WIN-T Inc 2 unit of measure quantity shown on P-21 is based on Communications Nodes, which consist of Tactical Communications Node (TCN), Points of Presence (PoP) and Soldier Network Extension (SNE).

Average Weapon System Procurement Unit Cost varies due to mix of configuration items (CIs) and procured quantities of echelons (e.g., Stryker BCT) to achieve Army fielding requirements.  For example, Divisions have fewer CIs resulting in a higher average cost per unit as is the case in FY17.

An Acquisition Decision Memorandum on May 30, 2014 directed the restructure of WIN-T Inc 3. As a result of this restructure, and once approved in an updated Capability Production Document (CPD), the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for WIN-T Inc 2 will be revised. At present, the AAO for WIN-T Inc 2 is 2,937 nodes, based on quantities in the WIN-T Inc 2 CPD approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council on 25 Nov 08, and most recently revised (Revision 3) and approved on 17 Oct 14. 

WIN-T Inc 2 will be fielded based on the Army Force Generation cycle. 

"In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities."</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line will be used to fund new and enhanced capabilities to modernize the Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) by reducing Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) and providing more expeditionary communications, leveraging the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) network.    
SIGMOD capabilities will provide upgrades and increase capabilities to Army ESB and other units equipped with WIN-T, allowing them to support the full spectrum of operations with Cellular Solution (4G LTE &amp; WIFI), Commercial Coalition Equipment, and Top Secret enclaves. Additionally, SIGMOD will provide redundancy communications in a satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Site (Terrestrial Transmission System (TRILOS)) and beyond line of sight (Troposcatter Transmission System (TROPO)) radio systems.
SIGMOD Capabilities: 
Commercial Coalition Equipment (CCE): Provides both Commercial and Coalition communications cross-banding capabilities supporting command control and coalition partners in order to enable Mission Command between forces.  By integrating disparate and unique forces communications together, the network is extended and Mission Command is further enabled. 
Modular Communications Node - Advanced Enclave (MCN-AE): Provides Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) communications to Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Signal Battalions over the WIN-T network. 
Cellular Solution (4G LTE and WiFi): Expands the WIN-T network below battalion, using an expeditionary 4G LTE cellular and wireless (WiFi) network.  The 4G LTE network provides a wide area of Situational Awareness (SA) and Mission Command (MC) capability via a mobile phone down to the individual Soldier.  The WiFi capability enables untethered Mission Command within the command post for wireless laptops, tablets and phone,  dramatically reducing TOC set-up and teardown times.  
Terrestrial Transmission System (TRILOS): Enables Mission Command in a satellite denied environment at higher throughput than the current High Capacity Line of Sight System (HCLOS).  TRILOS will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite band-width. TRILOS will extend the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the aging HCLOS system.
 Troposcatter Transmission System (TROPO): Enables Mission Command in a satellite denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite band-width.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $92.718 million supports procurement of eighteen (18) Commercial Coalition Equipment (CCE), twenty eight (28) Cellular Solution (consisting of 4G and WiFi) systems  and thirty four (34) Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) enclaves to support Transport Convergence. In addition, procures one hundred and twenty (120) TRILOS and sixteen (16) TROPO to support at the halt terrestrial and beyond line of sight communications supporting WIN-T Increment 1 units. Six (6) of the sixteen (16) TROPO systems will support FY19 test requirement.

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $4.900 million supports procurement of four (4) TROPO in support of Coalition Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR)

The Transmission Systems Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved on 30 Jan 2015.

            <proc:Description>Tactical Network Technology Mod in Service (TNT-MIS) is a realignment of funding programmed in WIN-T Increment I. 

Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) TNT-MIS provides refresh of obsolete/non-sustainable, End of Life, commercial tactical technology and other Information Technology (IT) component end item equipment (switches, routers, servers etc. ...) procured under tactical networking efforts. Technical refresh and modernization are critical to ensure the Army's tactical network maintains its security posture and compliance with new Information Assurance policies. TNT MIS is executing a 7-year tech refresh cycle to counter obsolescence and to sustain Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) IT components.  Tech Refresh reduces life cycle costs by reducing Size, Weight and Power through collapsing and converging capabilities that previously resided on individual hardware components into virtual servers, and leveraging common COTS solutions across various programs.


Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) connects all users to each other from theater down to the maneuver battalion, to joint and multinational elements, and the Defense Information System Network (DISN). WIN-T employs a combination of terrestrial, airborne, and satellite-based transport options, to provide robust, redundant connectivity. Network modernization is the Army's top priority, and WIN-T is its cornerstone program. It enables mission command on the move, keeping highly mobile and dispersed forces connected to one another and to the Army's global information network. With essential voice, video and data services, commanders can make decisions faster than ever before and from anywhere on the battlefield. WIN-T's infrastructure provides commanders and other users the ability to communicate via voice, data, and video simultaneously at all levels of security.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>TNT MIS B07110 is not a new start. This line results from a realignment of funds from BW7110 (current WIN-T Increment 1 funding line) to B07110 in FY18 and out.  

FY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $150.497 million procures WIN-T Inc 1 refresh of obsolete/non-sustainable, End of Life technology to support 62 various size units, Regional Hub Nodes (RHN), and  Tactical Network Management System (TNMS) 
(a) Technical refresh and modernization are critical to ensure the Army's tactical network maintains its security posture and compliance with new Information Assurance policies. TNT MIS is executing a 7-year tech refresh cycle to counter obsolescence and inability to sustain COTS IT components.  Tech Refresh reduces life cycle costs by reducing Size, Weight and Power through collapsing and converging capabilities that previously resided on individual hardware components into virtual servers, and leveraging common COTS solutions across various programs
(b) Supports RHN transport convergence
(c) Supports procurement and fielding of NetOps Database Migration Software NIPR, SIPR and Colorless Enclave. Migration is essential to support the convergence functions of planning and management between WIN-T Inc 1 and Inc 2 units
(d) Support Tactical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
(e) Supports Modernized Satellite Communications (SATCOM) components
(f) Support Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) enhancements to RHN and Expeditionary Signal Battalion (ESB) assemblages essential to execute the PED Continuity of Operations (CONOPS)

            <proc:Description>JOINT COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT ELEMENT (JCSE): JCSE, assigned under Joint Enabling Capabilities Command (JECC), US Transportation Command, is the only joint Department of Defense (DoD) unit specifically formed to provide Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) systems support for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) contingency operations worldwide. The JCSE mission is to provide, on short notice, those critical communications required to support Joint Task Force support (JTF) and Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) headquarters. These assets support the warfighter's ability to deploy rapidly and immediately provide the positive command and control required. This support includes contingency and crisis communications for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Defense agencies, non-Defense agencies, and foreign governments. The modernization program goals include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. Per Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) and Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM) 0291-14, the Army is mandated to fund 1/3rd fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>JCSE: FY2018 base funding in the amount of $5.051 million procures communications equipment based on Strategic Planning Guidance; which includes major upgrades to large and small aperture mobile satellite systems, Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP), Airborne/En-Route, Forced Entry and terrestrial and single-channel equipment. Currently employed commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment is approaching the end of its life cycle and requires replacement, along with technology refreshment; to meet the modernization program goals which include meeting emerging real-world operational requirements with improved capabilities, smaller footprint, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and seamless integration with the global information grid. This equipment is a critical part of Command and Control communications packages that provide direct operational support to joint forces and HQ elements deployed to austere locations around the globe. Per the Planning Guidance, the ARMY is mandated to fund one-third of the fair share of JCSE's validated equipment modernization plan. JCSE's Modernization Program is built/restructured based on Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service Components' requirements and emerging technologies. Services influence JCSE's spending plan through recommendations in concert with Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP) schedules, ensuring that Service dollars meet Joint Service requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Systems (DEWSS) provides Super High Frequency (SHF) wideband and Anti-Jam (AJ) satellite communications supporting critical national strategic and tactical Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) requirements. DEWSS is a Joint program supporting all of DoD, not just Army, and has oversight at the CJCS level.  The DEWSS/Wideband Global Satelellite (WGS) will be used in conjunction with the Terrestrial Transmissions of the Defense Information System Network (DISN) and other communications systems to provide end-to-end communications and long-haul connectivity.

The AN/TSC-93E Tactical Satellite Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) provides satellite communications (SATCOM) capability in the SHF (Super High Frequency) range.  93E operates over both commercial and military SHF satellites for Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs).  93E, along with the WIN-T program's AN/TSC-156 Phoenix Terminal, is the Army's primary means of extending DISN services (NIPR, SIPR, JWICS, DSN, DRSN, and Secure VTC) to deployed Army forces. 93E SLEP has replaced existing "D" models with "E" models.  E model upgrades the 93 from 20 Mbps to 50 Mbps, and extends the service life of the 93 until 2025.  93E configuration is as follows: up-armored, consisting of antenna pallet housing the AS-3036D antenna mounted on an M1152 D1 vehicle towing a M1102 trailer.  The M1102 transports two MEP-803A generators, a SN-571 SYNC box, and a 20 gallon fuel cell.  The cell will increase fuel capacity over 200%. A second M1152A1 will tow a fifth wheel commercial trailer transporting the AN/TSC-93E 250 shelter.  The 93E configuration will also work in a non-up armored mode using the M1097 and the M1113.

The Senior National Leadership Communications (SNLC) program and the required modernization effort exists through a bilateral agreement for a 10-year user equipment modernization.  This essential Priority 0 effort supports unique internal requirements that provide critical communications to support continuing relations between the United States President and Russia/Ukraine/Belarus/Kazakhstan leaders. The program includes the Direct Communications Link (DCL), Continuous Communications Link (CCL) and the Government-to-Government Communications Link (GGCL). Communications are for diplomatic peacekeeping, arms control and treaty verification purposes.

The Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (MET) program is a complete modernization of fixed X-Band enterprise satellite communications terminals.  The MET family of terminal equipment will increase the capacity of existing satellite communications facilities by adding military Ka-Band capability, enabling the Army to maximize its use of the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellation.  The MET's modular design and incorporation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems will improve the sustainability of Army enterprise satellite communications systems, reduce life cycle costs, and extend the life of the enterprise terminal family beyond 2025.

The Digital Communications Satellite Subsystem (DCSS) is an array of baseband equipment that is integral to the Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DCSS is the interconnection between the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the DEWSS satellite earth terminal equipment, providing users with access to the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) system, the Defense Satellite Communications System, and other military and commercially available satellite constellations. Provides deployed Warfighters with global connectivity to military command and control systems, reachback to the sustaining base, and access to enterprise information resources and the Defense Information Systems Network. Interfaces with the national strategic communications infrastructure to support Presidential and senior DoD leadership communications.

The Enterprise Wideband Satellite Payload Control System provides for the management of Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) earth terminal and satellite resources, which are required for rapid and efficient reaction to operational needs in support of the Warfighter. State-of-the-art strategic satellite payload network control and planning systems for use with DSCS, WGS, and commercial satellite systems are procured and installed at Wideband Satellite Operation Centers (WSOC) worldwide. Payload control functions control and configure the satellites.  Network control functions manage communications between operators and processors, generate and drive display formats, and maintain and provide rapid access to the network databases. The Army's effort to digitize forces has created a tremendous increase in demand for bandwidth. Subsystems ensure efficient use of satellite power and spectrum, overcoming existing and projected bandwidth constraints, and allow U.S. forces to achieve information superiority on the battlefield. Provide reliable satellite communications networks to support unique user mission requirements vital to national security under stressed and unstressed conditions.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $161.383 million support the following programs: 

FY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $1.205 million procures and integrates SHF Ka band capability with currently existing SHF X band capability, and conducts fielding and new equipment training of the AN/TSC-93E in support of the Active, Reserve, and National Guard components and supports program management organic support. 

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $1.355 million supports modernization of the Direct Communications Link (DCL) from serial based circuits to an Internet Protocol architecture.  Funding provides the procurement of hardware and software, installation, and training support.

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $50.958 million procures Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (MET) systems, and provides the required engineering, integration, and installation support for terminal fielding.

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount $46.806 million procures satellite terminal and baseband equipment and associated management systems in support of NETCOM's relocations of the satellite earth stations at Landstuhl, Germany and Camp Roberts, California. Provides the minimum essential baseband and telecommunications equipment to support the modernization of DCSS components and their integration into the DEWSS, including modernization of baseband infrastructure to enable net-centric Internet Protocol communications at satellite earth terminals. Supports Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) validated Combatant Commanders/Service long haul communication requirements and provides baseband equipment support for the Modernization of Enterprise Terminals (MET) program. 

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $61.059 million supports the procurement of hardware/software, engineering services, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) and Information Assurance (IA) for the Enterprise Wideband Satellite Payload Control System, which acquires and installs state-of-the-art strategic and tactical satellite payload control, spectrum monitoring, transmission control and network planning systems for wideband satellite constellations.

            <proc:Description>Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) extends the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) network to small company and team sized early entry units. The T2C2 system is based on combat proven capabilities and provides robust voice and data communication capabilities. The T2C2 systems will also integrate users into the higher capacity WIN-T network and extend that network to the tactical edge; T2C2 also enables warfighters in select small Command Posts (CP) (typically Company level) and select Army teams to send and receive time sensitive Situational Awareness (SA), Intelligence, and Mission Command (MC) information while At-the-Halt (ATH) in support of all Joint determined and defined operational phases.  These phases span from the initial Shaping Phase (designed to dissuade or deter adversaries and assure mission friends), Deterrence, Initiative Seizure and Domination culminating with post maneuver Stabilization and Enabling of Civil Authorities supporting a legitimate civil governance in safe and secure environment.

The approved Army Procurement Objective (APO) for Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) is 424 Lite systems, 390 Heavy systems.

The T2C2 Capability Production Document (CPD) was validated in November 2013.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 base procurement dollars, in the amount of $62.600 million, supports the fielding of the remaining Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantities and the procurement and fielding of Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities for T2C2 Light (71) and T2C2 Heavy (36) systems and the applicable spares.

FY17 and earlier cost estimates were based on the Program offices pre-Milestone C understanding of the system concept, projected system configuration and projected system costs. 
FY18 and beyond cost estimates are based on an updated system concept, actual system configuration and current contract system costs. The current period of performance ends in 4Q FY18, and program is currently working on extending the current contract.  System costs beyond the contract ordering period are inflated according to the economic adjustment factor of the current contract.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

            <proc:Description>Super High Frequency (SHF) terminal, also referred to as the Phoenix, satisfies tactical, highly mobile, command and control, intelligence, fire support, air defense and logistics wideband communications requirements in support of Army and multi-service users.  Phoenix provides the Army operational flexibility by operating over four bands (C, X, Ka, and Ku) on military and commercial satellites resulting in less dependency on costly and high demand commercial satellites.  Fielding is to Active, Reserve and National Guard Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs). The Army decided to retire legacy AN/TSC-85 terminals by 2015 and replace them with SHF (Phoenix) terminals and upgrade all Phoenix terminals from 20 to 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) aggregate capacity to meet growing capacity demands.  This program is designated as a DoD Space Program.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the SHF Terminal is 112.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $11.622 million supports Phoenix obsolescence mitigation efforts supporting FY17 Transition to Sustainment for legacy terminals; and implementation efforts to meet Transmission Systems Increment 1 Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. The CPD requirements  for an Ethernet Internet Protocol (IP) interface and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) modems will significantly enhance Phoenix interoperability with the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) terminals.  Funding supports implementation of an FY19 competitive contract award for these capabilities.

            <proc:Description>The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is a passive, space-based, radio positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system providing precise time, three dimensional position, navigation and velocity information to Warfighters. Accurate positioning, navigation and timing are critical enablers to all Army Warfighting capabilities. Timing is a key enabler to tactical communications networks.The NAVSTAR GPS program is designated as a DoD Space Program and the United States Air Force (USAF) is the executive service. The USAF GPS Directorate develops enabling technologies and products for GPS User Equipment (PE 35164F), with direct Army management and participation. The Army implements these technologies into Army architectures and user equipment.  The Army NAVSTAR GPS program provides for management, procurement, fielding and support of Army GPS User Equipment. GPS User Equipment consists of a family of Selective-Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) based PNT Capability solutions which span aviation users, ground users, host vehicles, and sensors. Current GPS User Equipment is comprised of a dual-use dismounted handheld or system-installed Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), DAGR Distributed Device (D3) for distributed PNT on platforms, and Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB-GRAM) for embedded PNT.

Public Law 111-383 Section 913 (January 2011) Authorizes FY 2017 and beyond appropriations to only procure GPS equipment capable of receiving the military code, commonly known as M-code, if M-code capable equipment is available.

Current Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the DAGR/D3 is 462,288 units.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>AN/TSC-154A, Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical -Terminal (SMART-T) is a multi-channel satellite terminal that provides beyond line of sight support for the current and future tactical communications network.  The SMART-T provides a robust, protected satellite capability to permit uninterrupted communications, as our advancing forces move beyond the line-of-sight of terrestrial systems.  The prime mover is a High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) configured with all of the electronics and a self-erected antenna.  SMART-T provides the only low probability of interception and low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) capability to avoid being targeted for destruction, jamming or eavesdropping.  Additionally, SMART-T provides fully interoperable communications with the Milstar terminals of other services (Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and other DoD agencies and activities). SMART-T terminals have been upgraded to use the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite constellation, which provides a four-fold increase in communication capacity over the current Milstar system, but retains full backward compatibility with the Milstar satellites.  SMART-T is designated as a DoD Space Program.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 324 terminals plus 8 terminals procured for the DoD Special Users.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $6.799 million support non-recurring engineering and fielding of the Ethernet Repeater (Transmission CPD Internet Protocol (IP)) requirements to previously procured SMART-T AEHF terminals.  Upgrading SMART-T with the IP interface will improve the connectivity and interface with WIN-T nodes, support New Equipment Training (NET) Operations, simplify training, and support Army echelons from Corps to Battalion levels.  It will also enable WIN-T Network Operations (NETOPS) to rapidly reconfigure and route priority traffic to mitigate effects of jamming on the vulnerable WIN-T transmission paths for all nodes.

            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base dollars in the amount of $21.667 million procures Ka Fixed Satellite Antenna (FISA) Modification Work Order (MWO) hardware, fielding, spares, training, bandwidth, software and program office support.

Operational Needs Statement (ONS) 09-9319 was revalidated by the HQDA G-3 on 5 Nov 2014 to support fielding of the objective capability, which will support a full brigade lift of the Alpha echelon for a forced entry operation. (ONS) 09-9319 was  validated by HQDA G3 in 5 Mar 2013.  $21.275 million was provided in September 2013 via an Above Threshold Reprogramming (ATR) on SSN BB8417 Modification of In-Service Equipment (TACSAT) in support of that ONS to provide an initial capability.  

Commensurate with rephasing of FY17 OPA funding into FY18/19, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku SATCOM band FISA Full Operational Capability (FOC) (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka SATCOM band FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.

Initial Operational Capability was met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).  FOC is 35 Ku FISA equipped C-17s, eight KENs, 24 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and an airborne command post suite (CASPAN).

            <proc:Description>The Profiler Virtual Module (PVM) provides meteorological (MET) data that includes wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity information required for use in the Advanced Field
Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). The information is necessary for precise targeting and terminal guidance to Field Artillery assets. PVM improves accuracy of predictive fires solutions and allows for first
round effects on target and reduces the risk of fratricide. This capability increases the lethality of indirect fire systems such as the rocket launchers, self-propelled or towed howitzers, and mortars.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base funding of $.070 million supports modernization of Profiler.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A):  This project is the Army component of the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Family of Systems (FoS). GCCS-A provides automated command and control tools, including Force readiness, planning and movement, and situational awareness, for Army Strategic and Operational Theater commanders to enhance warfighter capabilities throughout the spectrum of conflict during Joint and combined operations in support of National Security. GCCS-A dramatically improves the Army's ability to analyze courses of action, develop and manage Army forces and execute war plans. GCCS-A links the GCCS-Joint Common Operating Picture with the Army Mission Command systems. In accordance with Army Command Post Computing Environment and Joint Command and Control objectives, GCCS-A will be re-architected away from a scalable process architecture based server - thick client architecture to a virtualized server - web client architecture hosted on Battle Command Common Services / Tactical Server Infrastructure.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base funding in the amount of $2.658 million will support fielding of GCCS-A version 4.3.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>B90000 is a summary of Procurement funding for the Handheld Manpack Small Form Fit (HMS) program: B90210 (JTRS HMS - Handheld) and B90215 (JTRS HMS - Manpack); RDTE funding for the HMS program resides in Program Element 0604280A prior to FY 2017, and 0605042A in FY 2017 and out. The Manpack (MP) Radio is reflected under SSN B90210 in FY 2011 and 2012. The MP Radio is reflected under separate SSN B90215 in FY 2013 and out. As of FY 2017, HMS funding will transfer from the parent B90000 to the parent B95004. B90210 and B90215 will transfer to B95006 (Handheld), and B95007 (Manpack) respectively. This change was made in order to remove "JTRS" from the HMS nomenclature as the program is now Army led. Therefore, B95006 and B95007 will not be considered new starts in FY 2017.

The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a materiel solution meeting requirements for Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant Government Purpose Rights software waveforms (applications). HMS is an Acquisition Category IC program that encompasses specific requirements to support the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. 

HMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge/most disadvantaged warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS) / Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable,  networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communications.

HMS encompasses the Handheld (HH) Radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR)), MP, and Small Form Fit (SFF) radios. HMS radios will provide voice and support for data services such as text, control graphics, imagery, video, and telemetry to Warfighters and tactical end user devices including handheld, embedded, and larger computing devices, as well as unmanned systems.

The current HH AAO (Army Acquisition Objective) is 193,279:
-100,000 LR
-93,279 RR

The current MP AAO is 65,622</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Program has no FY 2018 funding request in this PE, as HMS funding has been realigned from the parent B90000 to the parent B95004. B90210 and B90215 realign to B95006 (Handheld), and B95007 (Manpack) respectively. This change was made in order to remove "JTRS" from the HMS nomenclature as the program is now Army led.

            <proc:Description>B95004 is a summary of the Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) program: B95006 (HMS - Handheld Radio) and B95007 (HMS - Manpack Radio). Prior to FY 2017, this effort was funded under SSN B90000: B90210 Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) HMS Handheld and B90215 JTRS HMS Manpack. The Manpack (MP) Radio was reflected under SSN B90210 in FY 2011 and 2012, and under SSN B90215 in FY 2013 through 2016.  In FY 2017 and out, B90000 no longer includes funding associated with the HMS Program. SSN B95004 was established to clearly associate HMS with Program Executive Office Command, Control and Communications‐Tactical (PEO C3T) under Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) and to remove "JTRS" from the HMS nomenclature as the program is now Army led. 

The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) radio program is a materiel solution meeting requirements for Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant Government Purpose Rights software waveforms (applications). HMS is an Acquisition Category IC program that encompasses specific requirements to support the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Special Operations Command communications needs. 

HMS provides voice and data communications to the tactical edge/most disadvantaged warfighter with an on-the-move, at-the-halt, and stationary Line of Sight (LOS) / Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability for both dismounted personnel and platforms. HMS radio systems are software reprogrammable,  networkable, multi-mode systems capable of simultaneous voice and data communications.

HMS encompasses the Handheld (HH) Radios (one-channel Rifleman Radio (RR) and two-channel Leader Radio (LR), MP, and Small Form Fit (SFF) radios. HMS radios will provide voice and support for data services such as text, control graphics, imagery, video, and telemetry to Warfighters and tactical end user devices including handheld, embedded, and larger computing devices, as well as unmanned systems. 

HMS is currently executing a May 2014 approved Acquisition Strategy (AS) to procure Non-Developmental Items (NDI) through full and open competition open to all potential industry partners. Two Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts were awarded in support of this effort. The first contract was awarded on 29 April 2015 to procure HH. The initial Delivery Order on this contract was to procure RR to test at the HMS Customer Test. On 13 September 2016 HMS presented the two-channel LR requirements to the Army Configuration Steering Board (CSB). The CSB validated the requirement and directed the establishment of a Basis of Issue (BOI) for the LR and the equivalent decrease in the BOI of the RR. The overall Approved Acquisition Objective for the HH remained unchanged. The Operational Test (OT) and procurement of the RR was deferred, and HMS was directed to move forward with a two-channel LR. The existing HH contract suite will be the vehicle for LR procurements. The LR will simultaneously run the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). An addendum to the AS was approved by the acting Army Acquisition Executive on 8 March 2017, which incorporates the LR requirements.

The second contract was awarded on 26 February 2016 and will procure NDI MP radios for use in a classified environment. MP is capable of running the following waveforms: SRW, SINCGARS, and Satellite Communications (SATCOM). Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), a Navy managed waveform, is a future fielded capability for MP.

The Army will award FFP IDIQ Contracts and will procure radios through a multiple step selection process:
a. Award FFP Contracts to all qualified vendors based on technical acceptability and demonstrations (26 February 2016 for MP and 4QFY17 for LR)
b. Award initial delivery orders based on Qualification Test results (19 December 2016 for MP and 3QFY18 for LR)
c. Award second delivery orders based on Customer Test results (3QFY17 for MP and N/A for LR)
d. Award first competitive delivery orders based on Field/Lab-Based Risk Reduction events (2QFY18 for MP and N/A for LR)
e. Award FRP delivery orders based on Operational Test and best value trade off construct (3QFY19 for MP and 3QFY19 for LR)

The current Handheld AAO (Army Acquisition Objective) is 193,279:
   -100,000 Leader Radios
   -93,279 Rifleman Radios

The current Manpack AAO is 65,622.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $355.351 million support the procurement of:
- 506 LR, (of which 140 are Mounted LR) for competition testing and fielding, support equipment, and fielding. It is anticipated that the radio procurement will be evenly split between two vendors. ($37.773 million)
- 3,152 MP Radios, NRE, support equipment, fielding, and vehicle integration. ($317.578 million)

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), these items are necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>HMS contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for Full Rate Production (FRP).

Vendors for the RR FRP contract are Harris Radio Corp (Rochester, NY) and Thales Communications (Clarksburg, MD). The Army has made the decision to pursue a two-channel handheld LR to meet the developing needs of Nett Warrior and the Warfighter community. The LR contract award is expected in September of 2017. Quantities shown may be split if multiple vendors qualify for award. Requirements for the single channel RR have been deferred to a later date.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>HMS contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for Full Rate Production (FRP).

Vendors for the MP FRP contract are Harris Radio Corp (Rochester, NY), General Dynamics (Scottsdale, AZ), and Rockwell Collins Inc. (Cedar Rapids, IA).  Quantity breakouts will be determined at the award of each Delivery Order. For planning purposes, quantity breakout for FY 2017 is an even split between the three vendors. Two vendors are expected to compete for quantities in FY 2018. Quantity breakout and vendors will be determined when the delivery order is awarded.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>
                    <proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>There will be two separate awards for the FY 2017 procurements.  The first award was made on 19 December 2016 and procured 51 Customer Test assets from each vendor (153 Manpack Radios total). The second award, as shown, is scheduled for May 2017 and will procure 1,310 Manpack Radios between all qualified vendors.</proc:OverallDeliveryScheduleRemarks>

            <proc:Description>The Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR) enables the extension of data services within the tactical network through seamless integration of the upper and lower tiers; providing software-defined, multi-channel networking radios for a wide variety of Army tactical vehicles to meet the Army's requirement for the Mid-tier Wideband Networking (MWN) capability. The MNVR provides self-forming and self-healing communication networks from the brigade to the platoon level throughout the full range of military operations.

The MNVR, a modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI), supports Army Mission Command operational requirements with a multi-channel, Type 1 (supporting multiple independent levels of security), vehicular mounted radio hosting networking waveforms Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The MNVR narrows the data capability gap at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) company level and provides the capability to build a data extension to the lowest echelons, and then enables the extension of services from the Forward Operating Base (FOB) to the platform. MNVR provides a dynamic, scalable, On-the-Move (OTM) network architecture, connecting the Soldier to the Mission Command (MC) Network and enhances capability to exchange voice and data simultaneously and faster than current systems. The advanced network waveforms provide rapid distribution of data and imagery with increased information assurance protection and automatic routing across complex terrain.  The system operates Internet Protocol (IP) based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput through self-forming, self-healing, managed communication networks.  Its route and retransmit functionality links waveforms in different frequency bands, within the 2 Megahertz (MHz) to 2 Gigahertz (GHz) range, to form one cohesive network.  MNVR nomenclature has been designated as AN/VRC-118(V)1. 

A single award contract was awarded on 24 September 2013, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed price, 3-year ordering period.  Production of 232 radios for Test &amp; Evaluation and certification purposes was completed in 3QFY 2014. On 3 Oct 2016, Defense Acquisition Executive (ADM) published a MNVR MS C Acquisition Decision Memorandum. Product Manager (PdM) MNVR will prepare for Government Regression Testing (GRT) and evaluation planning for First Unit Equipped (FUE).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $25.100 million supports the execution of the modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) strategy for a mid-tier networking vehicular capability to include the procurement of 77 MNVR Radio A and B Kits, program management office support, logistics and fielding support for previously procured systems. Radios procured will support Capability Set 18.


In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS LVT) is a communications device that provides situational awareness information exchange between aircraft, airborne command and control, Ground Air Defense and shipboard platforms in the Tactical Data Link-16 Network. The Army variant consists of three Line Replaceable Units (Main Terminal, Power Supply Assembly and Cooling Unit) installed on a mounting base, which physically and functionally replaces the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Class 2M terminal. MIDS LVT(2) to MIDS LVT(11) modification adds voice capability to meet emerging operational requirements.

The Army Acquisition Objective for MIDS LVT is 709 and the Army Procurement Objective is 572.  The Army procured 572 terminals through FY15 and no additional terminal procurements are planned.  Planned fielding supports the purchase of 572 Block Upgrade 2 (BU2) upgrade kits in support of National Security Agency and Federal Aviation Administration mandates. Voice hardware purchases (cables and cards) support the LVT(2) to LVT(11) conversions required for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System's (IBCS) Link 16 voice requirement. Procurement quantities depicted above are for BU2 upgrade kits only, no additional terminal procurements are planned.
  
Army MIDS is part of the Joint Navy-led MIDS program.  The Army leverages Navy contracts to support Army MIDS LVT efforts and to procure Block Upgrade 2 (BU2) upgrade kits.  The BU2 retrofit improves the capabilities and security of the MIDS LVT by incorporating the crypto-modernization and mandated frequency remapping to ensure compliance with National Security Agency and Federal Aviation Administration mandates. The BU2 kit replaces approximately five shop replaceable units within the radio.

Procurement dollars support the MIDS LVT(2) to MIDS LVT(11) upgrades used in the following systems:   Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell, Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAADC2), Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS), Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS), and Integrated Air and IBCS. 

The Low Volume Terminal (LVT) Cryptographic Module (LCM) is a subcomponent required to support the BU2 retrofit kit.   The LCM is procured from ViaSat and is provided as Government Furnished Equipment to the vendors (ViaSat and DLS) to support the retrofits.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base dollars in the amount of $11.160 million will support BU2 retrofit kits, engineering services, software support, and program management. The BU2 unit cost is pending negotiation and contract award.  With a planning retrofit unit cost of $.078 million, 109 BU2 retrofit kits may be procured in FY18. 

Procurement quantities depicted above are for BU2 upgrade kits only, no additional terminal procurements are planned.

Note:  The LCM is a low-cost ($2,850.00) subcomponent that is not reflected on the P-40 form; quantities in the P-40 represent BU2 retrofit kits only.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The AMC Critical Items Program oversees the process by which Class II and VII end items that are out of production and, consequently, now under AMC management, are re-procured to fill shortages.  The program supports major end-item (weapon system) inventory management through item managers.  The program requirements represent actual and projected equipment deficiencies and do not include obsolete items or items replaced by modernized successors managed by G8.

The Army Materiel Command (AMC) identifies Table of Organizational Equipment (TOE) items with identifiable line item numbers (LINs) that have valid unit requirements and support Army force generation requirements. These LINs are in the sustainment phase of their life cycle and are no longer being acquired by the Army.  In some cases there is a production base because of commercial, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or other service demands.  The Army prioritizes these items and determines that the systems requested herein are key to supporting current operations.

LIN H01907: The AN/ASM-146 Repair Shelter is an air transportable, mobile field maintenance facility that provides repair capability at the BCT level for all Commmunications-Electronics (C-E) systems and equipment and is critical to maintaining C-E readiness in the battlefield.

LIN P40750: Power Supply PP-6224, LIN P40750 is a power supply that furnishes 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32 Vdc from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase.

            <proc:Description>The Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, anti-personnel munition system that was designed to replace the capability of the persistent anti-personnel landmines banned from use after December 2010 per US Landmine policy. Spider, as a Man-in-the-Loop system, offers numerous capabilities for asymmetric warfare focusing on small unit force protection.  The system is made up of four subsystems: Man-in-the-Loop (the human operator), Remote Control Station (the system command and control station), Repeater (a communication link to the munitions that provides extended range), and Munition Control Units (delivers anti-personnel effects).  The Spider is designed to mitigate the indiscriminate initiation of the lethal mechanism.  A soldier makes a conscious decision to engage a target with the lethal mechanism. Spider's sensor capabilities and controlled munitions provide needed force protection and battlefield shaping.  Spider allows measured and graduated responses including sense only, non lethal, and lethal modes.  Spider also supports net-centric operations by feeding situational awareness information (location and status) into the Battle Command System.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  This item is Code A, approved for service use.  Type Classification Standard and Full Material Release were achieved in July and September 2013 respectively.  The Spider Army Acquisition Objective is 732 systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.996 million supports the Spider Increment 1 New Equipment Training (NET) team and provides fielding and logistical support for fielding events to the National Guard.

            <proc:Description>M7 Spider is a hand emplaced, remotely controlled, Man-In-The-Loop (MITL) anti-personnel munition system that is currently being fielded.  Spider Increment 1A (M7E1) utilizes an evolutionary acquisition approach which builds upon the baseline Spider Increment 1 system.  Spider Increment 1A will 1) replace the Spider Increment 1 Remote Control Unit (RCU) with a new Networked Munitions Control Station that includes mapping capability, interoperability to the Mission Command System (MCS) or Joint Battle Command Platform (JBC-P) and new technologies, 2) control current Spider AP munitions and 3) demonstrate the initiation of legacy GOTS AV (lethal) and AP (lethal and non-lethal) effects.  All other M7 Spider Increment 1 components (i.e. Control Station Transceiver (CST), Munition Control Units (MCUs)) will remain as is to ensure backwards compatibility.  The Spider system with its many desirable features makes it a versatile weapon system that has significant utility across the full spectrum of military operations and will support current and future operations.  The Spider Increment 1A Army Procurement Objective is 317 systems and the overall Spider program has an Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) of 705 systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP) was established by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1990 and 1991. The SEP evaluates available Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) equipment to determine if items have the potential to provide increased combat effectiveness to the Soldier.  The SEP OPA2 funding provided a means of procuring selected types of equipment (electronics and communications) designed to increase Soldiers' mission command, situational awareness and operational effectiveness through FY16.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>No additional funding required beyond FY2016.

            <proc:Description>The Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS) provides Soldiers with advanced active hearing protection that simultaneously protects Soldiers' hearing (from harmful Impulse and Steady-State Noises), while enabling situational awareness (e.g., enhanced ability to detect sounds) and mission command (e.g., voice communications over a tactical radio).  TCAPS enhances survivability and situational awareness by protecting Soldiers from noise induced hearing loss.  Soldiers wearing TCAPS are provided hearing protection capable of amplifying faint sounds that under normal circumstance would not be audible or intelligible with the naked ear and the ability to detect the direction of the sound.

TCAPS employs Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions that are evaluated on a periodic basis, in order to validate performance requirements and Soldier acceptance. The best commercial solution(s) evaluated are transitioned into sustainment and fielding. TCAPS hearing protection contributes to the reduction of post-service disability compensation and limits lost in-service time related to hearing injuries. To accommodate existing situations for Soldiers not assigned a tactical radio, the TCAPS Program includes TCAPS-Lite providing hearing protection and situational awareness for soldiers that do not require connectivity to a tactical radio for radio communications.

TCAPS Approved Acquisition Objective is 106,184.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 procurement dollars in the amount of $4.411 million procures commercial-off-the-shelf Tactical Communications and Protective Systems for up to one (1) IBCT and associated fielding.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) Report 11-114 states that the Veterans Administration purchased 382,000 hearing assistive devices at an estimated expenditure of $154 million in FY2008 and provided annual disability payments in excess of $1.1 billion in FY2009. Hearing injuries will be avoided only if Soldiers wear hearing protection. Historically Soldiers have had to choose between hearing protection and auditory situational awareness, TCAPS eliminates the need to make a choice by providing both along with enabling command, control and situational awareness.

            <proc:Description>The Unified Command Suite (UCS) is a fully integrated mobile communications platform that is self-sufficient and highly interoperable by integrating commercial off the shelf (COTS) and government off the shelf (GOTS) military communications hardware.  UCS provides communications interoperability with Federal, State, Local and Military Emergency Response elements at incident scenes.  UCS provides reachback capability which allows Incident Commanders the ability to assess an incident scene, advise responders, and facilitate access to Department of Defense information.  UCS provides critical Key Performance Parameter directed reachback communications for Analytical Laboratory Systems (ALS) and other Civil Support Team (CST) systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base funding in the amount of $15.275 million will modernize, upgrade, and procure components for the Unified Command Suites for National Guard Bureau Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams (WMD-CST).  Funding supports the satellite communication subsystem and land mobile radio modernization efforts.  Each of these components is at or will be at their end of life, near depletion of sustainment spare components, and has become more costly than obsolescence replacement.  In addition, each of the components listed represents a significant investment that requires modifications to existing subsystem assemblies for information assurance or regulatory purposes.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system interfaces Force Health Protection and medical surveillance information with Army Mission Command information technology systems.  The system captures and provides data for future medical care and medical record retention for all Servicemembers.  The MC4 system fulfills the requirements highlighted in United States Code: Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 55, Section 1074f, mandating the proper documentation of deployed Servicemembers' medical treatment to include pre- and post-deployment screening and its associated medical surveillance, enabling each soldier to have a comprehensive, life-long medical record of all illnesses and injuries. The collection and analysis of medical data provided by the MC4 system provides and enhances medical situational awareness for mission commanders.  The MC4 program is currently in full fielding of integrated Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) equipment.  The MC4 system is comprised of seven Line item Numbers (LINs) and is fielded to all Army units with medical assets.  The mix of LINs fielded to any unit is directly related to the unit's medical function and will differ dependent on the type of unit.  

In prior years, MC4 has procured and fielded equipment aligned with the incremental development of the jointly developed Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) electronic health record software.  As software increments have evolved to a final objective state (available in FY17), MC4 hardware has been replaced and upgraded to support the capability provided by the upgraded software increments and releases. The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) includes all seven MC4 LINs to be fielded which will operate the final version of the TMIP-J software and totals 39,883 LIN quantities of the MC4 system.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $15.964 million supports production engineering, fielding and new equipment training for new systems.  In addition, overall program office management efforts are funded in this appropriation.  Base funding in FY18 is required to continue fielding remaining gaps of MC4 capability to the Army medical force structure.  FY18 funding will procure 121 end components of the MC4 system for upgraded and new equipment fielding and provide new equipment training (NET) as needed for 11 Active units (1 engineering company, 2 military police units, 2 engineering companies, 2 maneuver enhancement brigades,1 veterinary medical unit, 1 aviation unit, 2 civil affairs units). The system is fielded and trained to units as they prepare for deployment or other priority missions.  The medical encounters captured by the MC4 system will provide the Soldiers' electronic health record as well as data to databases and systems that enable commanders to: identify population health trends and outbreaks; reallocate human and materiel resources based on needs; determine if locations are the source of illnesses or injuries; and make better tactical and medical decisions that impact the mission and Soldiers' health.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)(P.L. 110-181) this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing the military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program provides the Army, as a member of the Department of Defense (DoD) Counterintelligence (CI) community with advanced CI operational equipment to enhance Army’s ability to contour the global threat through significant improvements in information sharing, common situational awareness, and knowledge management in a joint operational environment.  The Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Enterprise Capital Equipment Replacement Program (CERP), as authorized and directed under INSCOM Policy Memorandum G6-1 by the INSCOM CG on 17 February 2017, provides for the systematic Life Cycle Replacement (LCR) of INSCOM Enterprise Common Computing Infrastructure to support INSCOM business, intelligence and security mission operations. Capital Equipment Replacement Program (CERP), G6 is to replace routers, switches, storage device, printers and monitors over six years old; servers, firewalls, and workstations over five years old; and notebooks over four years old. This program also provides the Army $0.5 million, as a member of the DoD CI community with advanced CI operational equipment to enhance Army’s ability to contour the global threat through significant improvements in information sharing, common situational awareness, and knowledge management in a joint operational environment.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base Funding in the amount of $9.060 million procures Information Technology (IT) hardware purchased for INSCOM to provide IT hardware in support of INSCOM’s Mission Command and INSCOM’s support to the war-fighting mission.  The IT hardware provides the necessary equipment for INSCOM personnel to perform daily and necessary Intelligence Community (IC) support.  Without this IT hardware, INSCOM personnel will not be able to execute IC business, intelligence, security and mission operations. Centralized consolidation and management of INSCOM Enterprise CERP provides increased infrastructure standardization, reduced management overhead, and significant cost avoidance. 

FY2018 Base Funding in the amount of $0.5 million procures the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) - compliant CI and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) material solutions to support implementation of case management, threat management information systems, and information processing systems at Service, Major Command (MACOM) and user level Army Intelligence sites.  Funding further provides specialized equipment necessary to support worldwide CI operations and investigation missions.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This program is vital in conventional operations and irregular warfare. Beginning in FY16, the portfolio for Civil Affairs (CA) and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) includes 11 systems. These systems are critical to the Warfighter's capabilities in all overseas contingency operations, theater security cooperation, and stability, transition and reconstruction operations. These systems are deployed in support of the combatant commanders engaging with foreign audiences, joint interagency and multi-national operations before, during, and after military operations. The program enables CA/MISO units to keep pace with the increasing Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MOTEs), rapid deployment rotational cycles, and the requirements of the Warfighter in various theaters of operations. The Army Acquisition Objectives for these 11 systems are 4 Fly Away Broadcast System-v2 (FABS-v2), 192 Media Production Center-Light (MPC-L), 4 Media Production Center-Medium (MPC-M), 33 MISO Print-Light (MISOP-L), 1 MISO Print-Medium (MISOP-M), 651 Next Generation Loud Speakers-Dismounted (NGLS-D), 641 Next Generation Loud Speaker-Mounted (NGLS-M), 708 Production Distribution System-Light (PDS-L), 10 Radio Integration System Lite (RIS-L), 846 SOF Deployment Node-Light (SDN-L), and 56 Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN).  In FY17 MISO is partnering with Defense Military Deception Initiative (DMDI) program to integrate Procurement prototypes with Component programs for acquisition, sustainment and maintenance.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Cryptographic Systems (CS) Program procures and fields Communications Security (COMSEC) solutions to secure the Army's tactical and enterprise classified networks.  New and emerging architectures, cease key dates, emerging threats, and DoD/Army policy are driving the need to replace current inventory of stove pipe systems with technologically advanced (network centric/Global Information Grid (GIG) compliant) devices that incorporate Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic standardization, advanced key management and network centric performance capabilities.  This program enables DoD to equip the force with critical cryptographic solutions and services during peacetime, wartime, and contingency operations. The program consists of three product families: In-Line Network Encryptors (INE), Link/Trunk Encryptors Family (LEF), and Secure Voice. (PD Net E)

The Army-wide Cryptographic Network Standardization (ACNS) effort brings cryptographic equipment into compliance with NSA mandated use of modern cryptographic algorithms and keys as well as the Army's upgraded data network including use of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), as mandated by the Army Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G6.  ACNS provides the Army fully modernized equipment and provides assistance in the areas of system identification, training, integration, network optimization, and property book updates to gaining Units.  ACNS is an essential project as many currently fielded legacy devices will fall out of compliance starting in FY 2015 due to NSA driven cease key dates.  Failure to comply will result in vulnerabilities to classified data transmissions, or an inability to communicate at classified levels. (PD Net E)

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities to Cyber Protection Teams. Teams enable passive and active cyberspace defensive operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities, and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems.  DCO consists of four critical capabilities: 

DCO-Infrastructure (DCO-I): the hardware and software baseline for remote cyber maneuver based on Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Plan X 
Cyber Protection Team (CPT) support: tools that reside inside DCO-I 
Web Vulnerability Scanning: the software baseline to secure key cyber terrain and protect DoD websites 
Big Data Analytics: analytics that leverage Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Acropolis analytics  

DCO responds to unauthorized activity or alerts/threat information against the Army enterprise, and leverages intelligence, counterintelligence, law enforcement, and other military capabilities.  It includes outmaneuvering adversaries taking or about to take offensive actions against defended networks, or otherwise responding to internal and external cyberspace threats.  Internal defense measures include mission assurance actions to dynamically reestablish, re-secure, reroute, reconstitute, or isolate degraded or compromised local networks to ensure sufficient cyberspace access for commanders.  The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capabilities to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to DoD networks and systems.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Communications Security (COMSEC) program consists of three sub-programs: Cryptographic Systems (CS), Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI), and Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI).

The CS Program procures and fields COMSEC solutions to secure the Army's tactical and enterprise classified networks.  New and emerging architectures, cease key dates, emerging threats, and Department of Defense (DoD)/Army policy are driving the need to replace currently fielded legacy systems with technologically advanced (network centric/Global Information Grid (GIG) compliant) devices that incorporate Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Requirements Oversight Council directed cryptographic standardization, advanced key management and network centric performance capabilities.  This program enables DoD to equip the force with critical cryptographic solutions and services during peacetime, wartime, and contingency operations.  The program consists of three product families: In-Line Network Encryptors (INE), Link/Trunk Encryption Family (LEF), and Secure Voice (SV). 

The AKMI Program is replacing the National Security Agency (NSA) Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program.  As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) by a sunset date of December 2017.  KMI automates the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution.  KMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band.  KMI provides an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) solution to support emerging cryptographically modernized systems.  KMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.  AKMI is a Non Program of Record (POR) under Product Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E).  The AKMI is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program.  AKMI supports DoD GIG Net Centric and Crypto Modernization Initiatives and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS).  AKMI will continue to support non-modernized legacy equipment until it can be upgraded to operate seamlessly within the AKMI architecture.  AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks.  AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12.  The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) will include the Management Client (MGC) Nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family.  Each component of the AKMI SoS is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.  Some components of the AKMI SoS will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS SoS while others will be developed, procured and fielded to meet AKMI requirements. 

The ECMI procures/retrofits and fields COMSEC embedded within Army radios to ensure communications remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms and keys. Tactical radios using embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after Cease Key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. ECMI will provide Warfighters with continued secure communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), by modernizing Army tactical radios allowing them to utilize cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. Failure to comply will result in vulnerabilities to classified data transmissions, or an inability to communicate at classified levels.

The Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for AKMI is 855 MGCs and 174,522 for AKMS (Fill Devices); Crypto Systems is 271,945 (Encryption Devices).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2018, the COMSEC funding of $107.804 Million supports below sub-programs.  

CS:  FY 2018 base procurement dollars in the amount of $49.441 million will be primarily utilized to procure modern In-Line Network Encryption (INE) and Secure Voice (SV) devices. $28.802 of the $49.441 million FY18 Base procurement dollars will be used to procure VIPER Variants, KSV-21 cards and various INE family devices. Currently there is a large installed base of Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) and Tactical STE devices that require KSV-21 cards for secure communication. KSV-21 Cards are a consumable item with a seven year useful life. 2,500 of these cards are coming up for replacement in the next 3 years.

AKMI:  FY 2018 base procurement dollars in the amount of $58.363 million supports the procurement, fielding, depot support and New Equipment Training (NET) for KMI MGCs, NGLD fill devices, and ACES laptops.  It also provides associated government and contractor engineering support, Post Production Deployment Software Support (PPDSS), system technical and software support of the AKMI SoS components.  The PPDSS contract supports AKMI SoS components, operational support for deployed and sustaining forces, technical engineering &amp; support, associated government and contractor engineering support, and the development and updating of Web based training for AKMI components to augment in-class delta and sustainment training. The PPDSS effort is an OPA requirement because of the new capabilities that are required to be implemented into key management products based on the evolution of the Key Management infrastructure.  The changes in capability do not allow the operational support to be transitioned to sustainment.  The PPDSS contract for all key management products has been optimized and requirements continuously assessed to ensure that it is fiscally sound. Funding enables modifications in the AKMI SoS to enable KMI standards compliance and to support legacy and emerging ECUs ability to communicate within the KMI architecture.  The PPDSS contract for all key management products has been optimized and requirements continuously assessed to ensure that it is fiscally sound.  Support for the AKMI SoS is critical until KMI is fully operational and fielded.  The current SKL fleet will require support through at least 2025.  Modernization of fill devices and emerging radio planning and configuration requirements are supported through this funding line.

ECMI:  No funding in FY 2018.  

IAW Section 1815 of the FY08 NDAA this item is necessary for use by the active components and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line is a continuation of CYBER efforts originally resourced in Information System Security Program, TA0600.

This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items for weapons systems. All IT procurements consist of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions; all quantities and unit costs vary by system configuration and site. 

The Army's Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to DoD networks and systems. They provide initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. DCO consists of the following critical capabilities: 
-DCO-Infrastructure (DCO-I) Tactical and Enterprise (hardware and software baseline for remote cyber maneuver based on Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Plan X)
-Cyber Protection Team (CPT) support (tools that reside inside DCO-I)
-Web Vulnerability Scanning (software baseline to secure key cyber terrain and protect DoD websites)
-Big Data Analytics (leverage Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Acropolis analytics) 

Defensive Cyber teams design, build, and test advanced Cyber tools and infrastructure than enables active defense of the network from tactical Command Posts up through Post Camp and Station Home Station Mission Command. This capability will enable integration of the Cyber Mission Force with Regional and Local Cyber Network Defense elements. These tools will provide cutting edge hardware and software, integrated with existing infrastructure and tools to facilitate Active Defensive Cyber operations. DCO responds to unauthorized activity or alerts/threat information against the Army enterprise, and leverages intelligence, counterintelligence, law enforcement, and other military capabilities. It includes outmaneuvering adversaries taking or about to take offensive actions against defended networks, or otherwise responding to internal and external cyberspace threats. Internal defense measures include mission assurance actions to dynamically reestablish, re-secure, reroute, reconstitute, or isolate degraded or compromised local networks to ensure sufficient cyberspace access for commanders.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 DCO Enterprise Infrastructure Base procurement dollars in the amount of $53.436 million supports the procurement of equipment, engineering, integration, configuration management, testing, training, accreditation, and fielding of defensive cyberspace infrastructure and capabilities as outlined in the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD) for DCO; US Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) 14-19545 for DCO-I dated 6 Jan 14; ONS 14-20079 for CPT Support; ONS 14-19420 for Web Scanning dated 29 Oct 13; and ONS 14-19419 for Big Data Analytics dated 29 Oct 13.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items for weapons systems. All IT procurements consist of COTS solutions.

Army user activity monitoring (UAM) operations are conducted in support of the Army's insider threat program. User activity monitoring is the technical capability to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device access US Government information in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. The OPA program supports three objectives. First, it provides advanced analytics (including user behavior modeling software) to increase UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. Second, it provides additional system hardware, and third, it support the procurement of the next generation Army UAM tool in FY21. Advanced analytics procurement includes commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, and open source software. This capability will increase UAM analysts' effectiveness and efficiency. The primary objective is to employ COTS technology to identify potential insider threats by monitoring behavior between users, user interactions with data and network capabilities (especially in regards to privileged users), and monitoring user compliance with network and data standards and policies.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 UAM Automation/Analytics Base procurement dollars in the amount of $0.690 million support the procurement, installation, assessment and authorization of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency in support of the Army's Insider Threat Program. Army executes its insider threat program in accordance with Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Section 922, Insider Threat Detection; and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program) dated 31 July 2013.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Funding provides technical subject matter expertise, infrastructure and networks for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE), supporting top secret and unclassified instance capability across the Department of Defense (DOD).  The program will provide a combination of loosely affiliated or independent virtual environments with varied capabilities that are scalable and extensible (the systemic measure to extend the ability of a system and the level of effort required to implement the extension through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality). Multiple DOD Component cyber ranges are expanding in varying stages of capability and capacity, and require a joint or standard approach for consistency and applicability.  PCTE will inform Cyber Range architecture to allow a mutually extensible network of capability at multiple organizational levels. The Cyber Mission Forces Persistent Training Environment Capability Based Assessment (CBA) identified requirements in PCTE Event Planning, Event Assessment, and Connectivity.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY18 base procurement in the amount of $4.000 million supports the identification and resolution of gaps in connectivity across the Cyber Service component ranges.  Site surveys will analyze the compatibility of cyber ranges and cyber mission forces’ training sites.  The identified shortfalls will be prioritized and satisfied with the available procurement funding.  Improved connectivity will include the procurement of transport, compute capability along with any associated operating systems.  The connectivity hardware and Operating System (OS) will provide a cloud-like environment which allows the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) to utilize available compute, storage, and application resources across all the cyber ranges.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems are commercial solutions that provide mobile and portable communications for garrison public safety, force protection, homeland security, and facilities maintenance operations. The primary users of LMR are emergency response personnel, including installation military police, fire departments, and medical personnel. These personnel use LMR to synchronize emergency response efforts and for critical communications support during dispatch, mobilization, deployment, and operations.  Without adequate communications capabilities that readily enable coordination, maximize the use of scarce radio spectrum, and provide secure voice transmissions, emergency responders and base support personnel would be significantly constrained in their ability to perform key functions.  LMR provides Army interoperability with state and local fire protection and law enforcement agencies critical to ensuring effective incident response via mutual aid agreements.  The LMR Program modernization of installation radio systems enables compliance with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) mandated migration from wideband LMR systems.  LMR systems are key components of the Army Enterprise used to provide a seamless communications network in support of base level communications and infrastructure.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base funding in the amount of $43.751 million procures the CORE Infrastructure for the CONUS Enterprise LMR System, modernizes Garrison LMR systems at two installations for the CONUS Enterprise LMR system; Soto Cano, Honduras; Japan; and provides contractor support.  Existing systems do not meet DoD and Army standards, are obsolete, are no longer supported by the manufacturer, and/or are non-compliant with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) spectrum efficiency mandate.  Power projection and power support Army installations across the continental US (CONUS) and the Europe and Pacific Area of Operations rely on base support LMR systems as a primary means to support force protection, public safety, installation management, and homeland security missions.

In accordance with Sections 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items.  All Information Technology (IT) procurements consist of COTS/GOTS solutions; all quantities and unit cost vary by project, system configuration, and site.

This program provides engineering, quality assurance, and Information Systems infrastructure (common user voice, data, video networks) in support of Military Construction Army (MCA) and Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects. It supplies non-tactical telecommunications equipment and engineering services for Army base operations. When required due to MCA or SRM projects, this program provides upgrades to regional or Theater Information Systems infrastructure, as well as physical plant infrastructure that directly support those Information Systems assets.  This program delivers standardized operational processes and procedures, providing the Army with consistent integration, synchronization, and delivery of voice, data, imagery, applications, and network capabilities down to the individuals in both the operating force and generating force Army-wide.  In conjunction with MCA or SRM projects, this program also provides funding for organization-specific command and control Information Systems requirements necessary to equip a new or modernized facility to a mission-ready state ahead of the physical relocation of the occupant organization.

PROPONENT/MISSION IT-MCA/PHYSICAL RELOCATION: 
This program funds organization-specific command and control Information Systems requirements necessary to relocate and equip an organization in conjunction with MCA or SRM projects. These may include specific IT requirements to facilitate connectivity from building infrastructure to end user equipment, items for classrooms, computers, video teleconferencing (VTC) systems, projectors, display/knowledge walls, telephone equipment, and other end user devices to include IT supporting classification above SECRET.  This program consolidates individual organizational requirements to provide a deliberate planned programmatic approach to procure mission essential Information Systems equipment. 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MCA SUPPORT):
This program provides for the worldwide Information Systems infrastructure (common user voice, data, video networks) for the MCA Program. It supplies non-tactical telecommunications equipment and services in support of Army base operations, LandWarNet 2020 and Beyond, Unified Capabilities, common user, and physical plant infrastructure to support Information Systems assets.  It provides standardized operational processes and procedures, enabling the Army consistent integration, synchronization, and delivery of voice, data, imagery, applications, and network capabilities down to the individuals in both the operating force and generating force Army-wide.

            <proc:Justification>PROPONENT/MISSION IT-MCA/PHYSICAL RELOCATION: 
FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $46.004 million support the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information systems and IT infrastructure to support command and control, critical mission unique equipment, and end user IT equipment in newly built MCA or renovated SRM facilities.  Proponent/Mission IT consolidates individual organizational requirements to provide a deliberate, planned, programmatic approach to procure network transport infrastructure, end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment, computing devices), associated licensing, and secure data switches, gateways, and encryption devices for classified and unclassified connectivity.  It also supports information systems for classrooms, computers for traditional business users and Warfighters, video teleconferencing (VTC) systems, projectors, display/knowledge walls, secure telephone equipment, and physical plant infrastructure to support those information system assets.  Procurements include network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, implementation, and completion of a multitude of MCA and SRM projects.  Installation of the mission unique/end user equipment is dependent upon construction timelines, is the final phase of an MCA or SRM project, and is required to ensure that new/renovated buildings are mission capable and ready for unit/Soldier occupancy.  

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MCA SUPPORT):
FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $23.564 million supports the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Information Systems which support Unified Capability voice/data switches, common user network transport infrastructure, end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment or computing devices), associated licensing, training range connectivity which may include long runs of fiber optics cable, and secure data switches, gateways and encryption devices for classified network connectivity. This funding also procures the network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, and implementation of Information Systems requirements associated with MCA projects. Funding is required to ensure that these projects have all necessary Information Systems infrastructure and equipment for soldier readiness of the facilities.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS (CONUS/WESTERN HEM):
FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $10.000 million supports the procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf information (COTS) systems which support Unified Capability voice/data switches, common user network transport infrastructure, end-user instruments (including telephones, soft phones, video teleconferencing equipment or computing devices), associated licensing, training range connectivity which may include long runs of fiber optics cable, and secure data switches, gateways and encryption devices for classified network connectivity. This funding also procures the network infrastructure engineering, acquisition, installation, security, and quality assurance to support the planning, design, and implementation of Information Systems requirements associated with SRM projects. Funding is required to ensure that these projects have all necessary Information Systems infrastructure and equipment for soldier readiness of the facilities.

            <proc:Description>The Emergency Management Modernization Program (EM2P) is a single integrated acquisition program for the design, procurement, fielding, new equipment training, and life-cycle management of emergency management capabilities in support of Army installations, Soldiers and their Families, civilians, and contractors.  EM2P provides capabilities that increase situational awareness, decrease responder time, and allow for quicker warning and notification of personnel during the management of an active incident.  EM2P consists of Mass Warning and Notification (MWN) technologies (fielded FY12-16), Enhanced 911 (E911) solutions (fielded FY12-16), and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) capability (fielding FY18).  CAD serves as the central hub for dispatching law enforcement, fire, and medical services on an installation and is integrated with Automated Installation Entry (AIE), Mass Warning and Notification (MWN), and law enforcement (LE) authoritative data sources as well as with local civilian CAD and civilian LE authoritative data sources.

            <proc:Description>This budget line does not procure weapons systems or produce end items for weapon systems.  All Information Technology (IT) procurements consist of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solutions; all quantities and unit costs vary by system configuration and site.

BU0530:
The Installation Information Infrastructure Modernization Program (I3MP) modernizes and refreshes the classified and unclassified Networks on Army posts/camps/stations across the globe.  Implementation of network modernization delivers modern communications Internet Protocol (IP) transport and data capabilities; optimizes existing and future capabilities; and divests legacy systems and capabilities that are no longer required or sustainable.  Installation-level network infrastructure is comprised of the electronics, wiring, and security equipment required to provide voice, video, and data communications to traditional business users and Warfighters.  Specific systems the program fields include classified and unclassified routing and switching components of the installation network; network paths (outside plant – fiber, cables and wires connecting all users and switching systems to one another); and power and  Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) needed to support operating the upgraded network equipment once installed.  I3MP is the very foundation of the Army and DoD Enterprise information technology modernization strategy to evolve to a single converged data, voice, and video network; this strategy is referred to as Everything over Internet Protocol (EoIP).  The converged network enables Unified Capabilities (UC) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE), and eliminates the need and costs to manage/maintain three separate voice, data and video networks on installations.  I3MP engineers, designs, and fields standardized, converged, UC-ready, secure Installation Campus Area Network (ICAN) infrastructure using Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions.  This infrastructure gives tactical and strategic end-users connectivity across the installation and the wide-area DOD Information Network (DODIN).  The I3MP modernization enables soldiers to operate their tactical warfighting systems in garrison to maintain proficiency while they are not deployed instead of relying on costly satellite usage time.  I3MP further enables valuable training as it provides the critical high speed and high bandwidth connectivity required for facilities and organizations to conduct Live, Virtual, and Constructive exercises and operations.  In Korea, I3MP continues to support IT engineering for the Yongsan Relocation Plan/Land Partnership Plan (YRP/LPP) to reduce the U.S. forces footprint and consolidate operations at Camp Humphreys.  It also resources the communications network backbone infrastructure for Joint communications on the Korean peninsula with phased replacement of the obsolete Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)/Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) infrastructure (52 ATM nodes circa 1997/28 SONET nodes circa 1999), that provide data, voice, and video communications.  I3MP support also includes providing communications capabilities to the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) Army Prepositioned Stock (APS) and Enduring European Equipment Set (E3S) Sites; and the communications infrastructure capabilities for our forward stationed Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) requirements in Korea. 

BU0510: 
OPERATION ATLANTIC RESOLVE (OAR) NETWORK:  Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) within the I3MP line specifically support the OAR network, provides coalition mission support, Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and collaboration capabilities to the US and Allied Partner Nations participating in OAR activities.  It supports the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI)and will enable local and distributed training across the European Command (EUCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).  The network serves as the central operational synchronization platform to enable coalition multi-national training and execution at the tactical and operational level spanning Central Region to the Baltics.

BU3610:
The World Wide Technical Control Improvement Program (WWTCIP) is a continuing program to initiate, improve, expand and automate the Army's Technical Control Facilities (TCFs) with a more efficient capability to monitor communications networks and perform the restoral activities required to enable critical warfighting and sustainment capabilities.  These upgrades provide the end user with greater bandwidth for high quality voice, data, video, enabling real time response and restoral actions to minimize communications outages.  This program provides configuration management and implements Information Assurance (IA) controls for the modernized TCFs.  The program is essential to support Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) Theater Combatant Commander's communications, Continental United States (CONUS) power projection bases, and Defense Satellite Communications Systems.   

BU2000:
The Terrestrial Transmission (TT) program is a component of the Army's seamless Enterprise Network that provides long-haul communications compatibility across operational systems supporting the Department of Defense approved program to modernize and integrate digital operations within the Pacific and European Theaters. The goal architecture will be able to accommodate the rapidly changing deployment and realignment of forces within the Pacific and European Theaters. The objective is an integrated, survivable network that provides voice, data messaging, video and transmission services to the Warfighter. It will also continue the upgrade of power, and timing and alarm systems for the European Transmission Systems. The Army Special Access Program Enterprise Portal (ASEP) is the Army's only Top Secret compartmented wide area network providing a secure communications capability (email, video, teleconferencing, document storage/sharing, voice over internet protocol and instant messaging) for the transmission of highly classified Special Access Required (SAR) information between the Army Operations Center (AOC), the Army staff, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, Army Special Access Programs (SAPs) and Army Sensitive Activities (SAs).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>BU0530:
FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $175.659 million supports the end-to-end dependencies needed to deliver CONUS/OCONUS network modernization to Army posts, camps and stations (P/C/S).  These procurements include: surveys of Army posts, camps and stations (P/C/S); the engineering and design necessary to modernize and optimize Army P/C/S; the IP transport and data hardware; the installation and implementation of the engineered hardware solutions; and the divestiture of legacy communications network components.  Equipment procurements include, but are not limited to, high speed Information Campus Area Network (ICAN) level switching devices, high capacity routers, and optical fiber.   Funds also support communications infrastructure capabilities for European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) Army Prepositioned Stock (APS) and Enduring European Equipment Set (E3S) sites; forward-stationed Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) requirements in Korea; modernization of all installations in Korea, and program management costs.   The modernization and convergence of voice, data and video networks to a high capacity communications infrastructure enables the Army to deliver mandated Unified Capabilities (UC) and reduces operation and management costs for the enterprise.  

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $2.500 million supports ERI enhanced prepositioning of the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) presence.

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>REMARKS: I3MP is a complex program that orchestrates the implementation of multiple disciplines (connectivity (voice, data, Outside Cable Plant (OSP) network)), capacity, storage and information assurance) across multiple locations each with their own developmental cycle, frequently resulting in the overlapping development and implementation of customized communications solutions (to meet unique and diverse mission conditions) at each Army installation. Unit costs and accompanying number of implementations (installations) will, therefore, vary from year to year, due to the complexity of the requirement, size of the installation, state of the information technology being replaced/modernized, the type of technology required, unique configuration and level of effort required to satisfy all requirements.

            <proc:Description>The Joint Program Office (JPO) for Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Terminals supports all of the Joint Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The IBS is the worldwide DoD standard network enterprise for transmitting time-sensitive tactical intelligence and targeting data to all echelons of Joint Service operational Users. The JPO's role is to coordinate modernization and sustainment of IBS terminals compatible with the UHF SATCOM IBS broadcasts. The transmit/receive-capable Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) systems satisfy the radio communication Key Performance Parameters for the IBS Program. The JTT is the official IBS producer system, and ensures continued IBS interoperability to a variety of tactical producers/consumers across the Joint Services. JPO IBS Terminals performs JTT life cycle program management through acquisition, fielding support and sustainment of recently upgraded JTT equipment. The JPO coordinates support as needed for the new IBS network that employs new crypto, a new Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB), and the Common Message Format (CMF). Funds support JTT configuration management, procurement of parts, JTT component obsolescence redesign/engineering, JTT sustainment coordination, JTT organic hardware depot establishment and JTT fielding support.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $12.154 million funds support the start up of JTT organic hardware depot capabilities, continued component obsolescence and integration engineering, continued procurement of JTT-IBS initial spares, configuration management, sustainment, training, and fielding support.

            <proc:Description>Prophet Enhanced (PE) is the current system under the Prophet Ground acquisition program.  The PE is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)/Electronic Warfare system for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces. PE provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack).  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of Technical Insertions and Pre-Planned Product Improvements to ensure operational relevance.  PM Prophet will modernize legacy systems to provide for fleet modernization to meet the requirements of the Prophet program and match the capabilities of the Prophet Enhanced sensors and platforms currently being fielded to the Army.  In FY 2017, modifications to Prophet Enhanced began in the Modifications-In-Svc line, BZ9753.

            <proc:Description>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning and targeting capability.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, and the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and Portable configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint. As newer versions of the baseline software are tested and released, a continuing series of software releases will be integrated into Army common/commodity hardware and fielded to units in accordance with (IAW) the Army Force Modernization Strategy and the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL).

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan. This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGSA continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) for FY19 fielding.

DCGS-A hardware and software is based on a combination of Government Off The Shelf (GOTS), Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that are integrated into scalable configurations, tailored to Warfighting functions. These product line components include the software baseline, server suite [Intelligence Fusion Server (IFS)] and individual analyst Multi-Function Workstations (MFWS), such as Portable and Fixed MFWS (P-MFWS/F-MFWS) and the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Workstation. These components are also used to upgrade existing fielded Intel Programs of Record to enable the establishment of the Army COE while simultaneously assuring system compatibility and interoperability within the DCGS-A enterprise.

DCGS-A is designated as a Major Automation Information System (MAIS), and is deployed on multiple hardware platforms and security levels across the Army.  The DCGS-A Increment 1 Full Deployment Decision (FDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) dated 14 November 2012, authorizes continued deployment of Release 1 capabilities.  The DCGS-A Increment 1 Release 2 Fielding Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) on 4 November 2015 after a successful Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) event in May 2015.  

DCGS-A ISR capabilities are deployed at all echelons across the Army.  DCGS-A consolidates and modernizes the Army ISR PED capabilities from 14 legacy Program of Record (POR) systems and significantly reduces their sustainment burdens.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 Base funding in the amount of $274.782 million will update and procure components for the DCGS-A Fixed Sites and Army, Reserve, and National Guard units, providing fixed and portable system configurations IAW the Army's Equipping Strategy. The DCGS-A updates will continue to enhance the Army ISR PED capabilities to meet new threats or emerging capability needs. Funding supports the ARPL by equipping and training the force as well as deploying units with the current DCGS-A software release. Funding will also provide for the acquisition of the Cross Domain Solution Suite (CDSS) which continues to support the fielding of Release 2 High Side software. Fielding of the Release 2 includes High Side capability at the Brigade level.  To meet the ARPL fielding schedule, the PM has ramped up to 5 training teams which will support the accelerated fielding of Release 2 software and potential Capability Drops.  Funding also procures new COTS software licenses to enhance performance of fielded systems, as well as support integration of Intelligence Community investments. DCGS-A supports the Army's Geospatial Transformation by providing an integrated visualization capability for intelligence, terrain, and weather effects in a net centric environment. Funding will also support continued alignment with Army COE objectives.

FY2018 OCO funding in the amount of $39.515 million is required to procure hardware and software to permit deployed units to conduct intelligence reach and reach-back operations. Funding will also procure the required hardware and software needed to maintain the effectiveness of DCGS-A capabilities and servers supporting in-theater Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.

COMMENT: Quantities on the P40 breakdown do not equal quantities on the P5 because systems are comprised of varying configurations of hardware and software components.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) system provides the Army's only in-theater capability for directly downloading raw infrared data from the Defense Support Program satellites, processing this data into ballistic missile early warnings, alerting, cueing, and disseminating that information reliably to theater combatant commanders. JTAGS Block I, fielded since 1997, currently has five ground stations (four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning and the fifth CONUS system serves as a training system and a spare deployable asset). JTAGS systems are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, EUCOM, and CENTCOM). Obsolescence/Information Assurance issues coupled with the desire to take advantage of the Air Force's investment in newer satellites (Space Based Infrared System, SBIR) and their improved sensor’s warning accuracy and timeliness, led to the Army's approval/initiation of a two phase JTAGS Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) Block II program. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 includes de-sheltering the system and upgrading hardware/software to address obsolescence/ Information Assurance issues. JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite getting critical capabilities fielded sooner. These capabilities are primarily software improvements designed to take full advantage of new sensors on orbit. FY 2017 funds completes procurement of JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 upgrades.  Prior years funding began the procurement of the JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 1 upgrades.  Two (2) of Five (5) Block II Phase I upgrades were procured with FY 2014 procurement dollars.  FY 2019 funds will procure JTAGS P3I Block II Phase 2 software upgrades for the program’s five systems.  

Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) is five systems.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) Program has no procurement funding in FY 2018.

            <proc:Description>TROJAN, as an Army Intelligence system, has been providing direct support and an operational readiness capability to soldiers since 1983. TROJAN provides the tactical commander with remote access to signal environments, in order to maintain a high state of operational readiness and enhance the training and sustainment of highly perishable intelligence skills. Additionally, the TROJAN architecture provides the infrastructure enabling split-based and force protection operations in direct support of the warfighter.

TROJAN NexGEN, formerly TROJAN Classic XXI (TCXXI) advances the tactical commanders' readiness in the areas of training (technical and operational signals intelligence (SIGINT)), operational intelligence production and dissemination, and operational support to split-based intelligence operations supporting force protection operations. TROJAN NexGEN's principle use is to provide remote access to target environments, enabling split-based operations from a sanctuary by being the gateway interface to environments of immediate relevance to every supported commander's priority intelligence requirements. In addition, NexGEN will continue its role as an operational readiness system, while also supporting commanders' intelligence requirements across the spectrum of conflict. 

TROJAN NexGEN is an intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) system that supports the increased readiness of key mobilization personnel in preparation for actions in the mission areas of The Army Plan (TAP). NexGEN is capable of maintaining operational readiness status of unit personnel supporting the full spectrum of military operations as outlined in the Army Strategic Planning Guidance and Army Planning Guidance sections of the TAP.

TROJAN NexGEN provides operational readiness capability to an Army commander employing a rapid global response capability to any level of military conflict throughout the seven mission areas. By employing reach technology relay capabilities between the forward deployed sensors and the sanctuary-based Remote Operational Facilities (ROFs), NexGEN can meet the operational deployment timelines through the use of readiness training venues to meet the requirements of units from Brigade Combat Teams through Corps and Echelon Above Corps (EAC). This operational concept provides the unique capability to remotely control the sensors and direction finding capabilities of the Deployable Collection Assets (DCAs) and process and analyze the collected information for timely reporting of time-sensitive information to the forward deployed Army, Joint Service and Multi-National warfighters.
 
TROJAN SPIRIT provides Army units with dedicated, secure, high capacity, Sensitive Compartmented Information high intelligence data processing and communications. It provides a rapidly deployable, multi-level security, processor-to-processor, high capacity communications capability, and supports tactical to strategic reach-back, essential to split-based operations.

Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) Mobile Integrated Communications System (JMICS) is a Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) approved deployable version of a garrison JWICS with the Army G-2 (DAMI-IM) as the J2 appointed JMICS Program Manager with the responsibility for managing and sustaining JMICS, a deployable TS/SCI capability.  JMICS is a self-contained mobile communications system providing reach back and access to the Intelligence Community (IC) in support of Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Force (JTF) requirements and Service Commanders.  The 14 JMICS systems provides JWICS video teleconferencing (VTC), TS/SCI and Secret/Collateral data and voice communications/reach back via JWICS and SIPRNET, secure telephones and other information support systems in a self-contained mobile configuration.  JMICS also provides unclassified local area networks (LAN) capability via NIPRNET.

All funding goes to the Active Component.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Special Purpose Systems (BZ9751): Technical Insertions (TI) will be made to the ground-based Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) system with additional capabilities required by theater units to effectively engage enemy forces and provide Force Protection information to friendly forces. Procure Government and Commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS/COTS) Next Generation SIGINT capabilities that are theater specific and enable the Prophet system to address specific threats and Signals of Interest (SOI). Prophet Enhanced is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based SIGINT/Electronic Warfare system for the Multi-Function Teams (MfTs), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs), and Expeditionary-Military Intelligence Brigades (E-MIBs).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  Prophet Enhanced provides a modular, scalable, open architecture-based system solution optimized for ease of use in a variety of configurations (Stationary-Fixed, Mobile and Manpack). It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of TI to ensure operational relevance.

Prophet Enhanced Modifications MIP (BZ9753): In FY18, PdM Prophet will continue modification to retrofit, test, train, and support previously fielded Prophet Enhanced systems not currently hosted on a prime mover to the latest mounted configuration.  Prophet Enhanced is the tactical commander's sole organic ground-based SIGINT/Electronic Warfare system for the Multi-Function Teams (MfTs), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs), and Expeditionary-Military Intelligence Brigades (E-MIBs).  Its primary mission is to provide 24-hour Situation Development and Information Superiority to the supported maneuver brigade to enable the most effective engagement of enemy forces.  It also incorporates the ability for rapid integration of Technical Insertions to ensure operational relevance.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement funding in the amount of $4.241 million will support the implementation of Modern signal-of-interest (SOI) enhancements for Prophet Enhanced.   An upgraded software capability will ensure that Prophet remains relevant against modern threats, providing an open architecture that allows capability integration to address advanced signal types in a constantly changing spectrum environment. There will be no hardware purchased in FY18, therefore a specific quantity cannot be applied to the distribution.

FY 2018 Base procurement funding in the amount of $46.793 million supports the modification of 12 legacy systems, procurement of 30 dismount SIGINT Manpacks, plus associated support, integration and testing for these systems. FY2018 Training/Fielding represents the delivery and New Equipment Training (NET) of the FY2017 Prophet Enhanced systems. 

FY2018 OCO procurement funding in the amount of $2.300 million procures 12 dismount SIGINT Manpacks; six of the Manpacks will be fielded to units located within the U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) area of responsibility and six of the Manpacks will be fielded to units within the Global Response Force (GRF) area of responsibility.

All funding is for the Active component.

            <proc:Description>The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS) is the Army's CI and HUMINT tactical collection and reporting system. CHARCS provides automation support for information collection, reporting, investigations, source &amp; interrogation operations and document exploitation. The CHARCS automation architecture extends from the individual HUMINT team soldier or CI agent to the Corps. CHARCS reports digital data such as maps, overlays, images, video, biometrics, scanned documents and audio files. These media are transmitted through secure networks and interfaces with the Distributed Common Ground Systems-Army (DCGS-A) for detailed analysis and creation of finished intelligence products. Collection and reporting teams at Military Intelligence (MI) battalions and their operational managers are equipped with one of two CHARCS systems. The first is the AN/PYQ-8 Individual Tactical Reporting Tool (ITRT) which provides collection and processing devices for individual HUMINT team member or CI agents. The second is the AN/PYQ-3 CI/HUMINT Automated Tool Set (CHATS) which provides the team leader (who normally directs 3-5 team members)and Operational Management Team (OMT) tools to process and manage team-collected information and a robust set of devices such as printers, scanners, and cameras to assist the collection mission. The CHATS is also used by Operational Management Team (OMT) (who normally directs 3-5 collection and reporting teams). Each CHATS has an associated Mission Support Peripheral Sets and Kits (MS-PSK) or Collection Peripheral Sets and Kits (C-PSK).

The C-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions. C-PSK capabilities are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies and include video and camera equipment, global positioning system (GPS), and voice recording device.  Phasing in of the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD), to displace the C-PSK, will begin in FY 2018 and complete in FY 2019.  The EUD is a COTS Mobile Handheld device, managed by PEO Soldier, which provides all of the operational capacity of the C-PSK in 1 hardware device.  The MS-PSK provides specialized collection component capabilities to support CI/HUMINT collection missions. MS-PSK capabilities are COTS technologies and include night vision photography &amp; video, captured materiel tracking, digital media forensics software, and Document Exploitation (DOCEX) software.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 OPA Base funding in the amount of $7.815 million procures mission equipment, supports fielding, training, logistic and mission equipment refresh to Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) units.

FY 2018 OPA OCO funding in the amount of $14.460 million procures Cellular Exploitation Kits and Media Exploitation Kits to Multi-Function teams for OFS.  The funds will also procure End-User Devices to replace existing C-PSKs for OFS that are reaching End of Useful Life (EUL).

            <proc:Description>Close Access Target Reconnaissance (CATR) is a kit of electronic devices that acquires, collects, and transmits data to provide near real time feedback in order to validate, follow, locate, or track a target (i.e., tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL)).  CATR will use electronic audio and or video recorders to obtain information which is used to validate movement and identify targets.  In addition, CATR allows for threat monitoring that can be integrated into existing operational tools, help to paint a clearer picture of the battlefield, pinpoint possible target locations, and identify and exploit enemy movements and patterns.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $8.050 million supports the fielding of 21 CATR sets to four (4) Brigade Combat teams (BCTs).  Funds will refresh and re-kit existing Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) sets/systems at Bluegrass Station Kentucky for the Program of Record (POR) sets/system configuration.

            <proc:Description>Product Lead Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) manages two Army biometric tactical collection devices, the Biometric Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A) Kit and BAT-A Handheld (HH).  These two devices support the Army Force Protection Mission and Identity Dominance Mission.  The BAT-A system is the Army’s biometric tactical collection devices which collect, match, store, and share biometric and contextual information on Known &amp; Suspected Terrorists, potential adversaries, host nation personnel, and third country nationals.  Recipients of collected information include DoD organizations, other U.S. government agencies, and Coalition Partners.  The BAT-A devices are also used by non-Military Intelligence personnel (Infantry and Military Police).   The capability was originally deployed as a Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) and has been deployed in a combat zone and other OCONUS contingency operations for the past decade.  The current BAT-A systems will serve as the Army biometrics enduring capability through FY22.  PL BAT-A will continue to serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility as the BAT-A is now a Post Milestone C program of record in sustainment.

United States Central Command (CENTCOM) submitted JUONS CC-0548 on 11 Dec 15 for enhanced biometric capabilities to support current operations.  The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated 5 of 6 key requirements of JUONS CC-0548 on 3 June 2016 and identified the requirements as "key enablers" to existing JEON CCE-0008 (near Real-Time Identity Operations).  The Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) assigned execution responsibility for the validated 5 key requirements in JUONS CC-0548 to the Army on 30 June 2016.  The Army Acquisition Executive assigned OPR to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors/Project Manager for DoD Biometrics on 13 September 2016.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) procurement in the amount of $5.180 million procures multiple Biometric Automated Toolsets - Army (BAT-A) Kit Hardware and BAT-A Handheld (HH) accessories for quantities RESET/REFRESH activities supporting both Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and Operation Inherent Resolve for ISIL (OIR).  Specifically for OFS, requested funds will refresh 204 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals; refresh six (6) BAT-A Servers with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A Handheld obsolete parts and accessories ensuring the continued mission critical capability.  Specifically for OIR, requested funds will refresh 63 BAT-A laptops and obsolete peripherals; refresh two (2) BAT-A Servers with accessories; and will refresh BAT-A Handheld obsolete parts and accessories ensuring the continued mission critical capability.

The Biometric Automated Toolset - Army (BAT-A) requires both hardware reset and associated minor software integration to maintain operational viability.  These devices have been in Iraq and Afghanistan well beyond the standard 3 – 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.

            <proc:Description>The AN/TPQ-50 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a highly mobile radar that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers and is capable of being deployed in two configurations, standalone or vehicle mounted.  The AN/TPQ-50 system interoperates with mission command systems (MCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).

                    <proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 OPA Base funds of $20.459 million will support the procurement of 5 AN/TPQ-50 full rate production (FRP) systems, fielding of systems to United States Army units, retrofit of QRC and LRIP systems, engineering changes, information assurance and program support

Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 total funding includes $56.692 million OPA OCO. Funding will be used to procure 24 program of record (POR) AN/TPQ-50 radars, of which a quantity 20 will support of the Army Prepositioned Stock (APS) requirement per the Capabilities Production Document (CPD) and 4 will be fielded directly to Army units. This funding also supports the procurement of an additional 18 systems to replace POR systems which were diverted in support of the Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS).

Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 system buy was combined with FY16 buy to take advantage of the best quantity range pricing, reducing the total hardware cost by $0.912M (26%) for those three systems.</proc:OverallHistoryPlanningRemarks>

            <proc:Description>Persistent Surveillance Systems - Tethered (PSS-T) is a program of record comprised of 29 Large (formerly Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS)) and 29 Medium (formerly Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS)) sized Aerostats. PSS-T has been assigned to Army Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  Both tethered Aerostats are equipped with high resolution Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) camera systems and wide-area assessment sensors. Video collected by PSS-T is distributed to the Forward Operating Base and division commander information center as well as to quick reaction forces via Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Extension Kits, providing tactical commanders enhanced battlefield situational awareness.

PTDS - The baseline configuration includes the US Army Research Lab's Unattended Transient Acoustic Measurement and Signature INTelligence (MASINT) System (UTAMS) which operationally cues the PTDS MX-20 EO/IR sensor to slew onto a target. The UTAMS is an acoustic sensor design consisting of sensor stations linked via radio to a base station. Each sensor station includes microphone arrays, signal processor, and display. The baseline PTDS also includes the Joint Synchronization Information Transmitter (JSIT) Mini-Tactical Common Data Link transmitter that transmits MX-20 video stream to ground forces equipped with One System Remote Video Terminal. Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PTDS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response. PTDS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding High Antennas for Radio Communications (HARC) radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Highband Networking Radio (HNR) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) via weather relay kits; added dual sensor capability; additional ground moving target indicator STARLite and wide area motion imagery Kestrel sensors, Persistent Surveillance Systems (PSS) Slew to Cue, coded laser target designation, and Survivability enhancements.

The PGSS has been a highly successful example of quickly delivering urgently needed capabilities to the Warfighter at remote forward operating bases (FOBs). PGSS continues to meet other urgent theater needs through system upgrades: adding HARC radio, the PRC-117G wide band radio, Quint Networking Technology (QNT), and micro-Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) as part of the aerial layer network extension architecture; transmitting weather data directly to AFWA via PGSS Weather Web, added dual sensor capability; additional Vista, Kestrel, and wireless identification sensing platforms (WISP) sensors, PSS Slew to Cue, Precision Fires, coded laser target designation, and Survivability enhancements. Additionally, Expendable-Unattended Ground Sensor (E-UGS) enhances the PGSS ability to detect enemy vehicle and footstep traffic and provides improved situational awareness and facilitate tactical response.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Sentinel system is used with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control [FAAD C2] element and is a supporting program to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture via the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System [IBCS] to provide critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel [AN/MPQ-64A1/A3] consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe [IFF], and Forward Area Air Defense [FAAD] Command, Control and Intelligence [C2I] interfaces.  The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a sense and warn role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar [C-RAM] missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 km.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets [cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft].  Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and allow engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.</proc:Description>

                    <proc:Description>Sentinel Modifications include waveform upgrades for the Receiver/Exciter and Target Classification upgrades/replacement of the current Sentinel transmitter with Power Amplifier Modules [PAM]. The Exciter upgrades will provide low level Radio Frequency [RF] signals sufficient to support the acquisition and tracking of cruise missile targets and the generation of target classification waveforms. Receiver upgrades accomplish receipt and signal conditioning of low level RF signals prior to Analog/Digital [A/D] conversion sufficient to support the acquisition and tracking of cruise missile targets and target classification. Variable rotation rate provides capability to slow the antenna rotation, increasing time on target to acquire and track small cruise missile targets and to provide flexible antenna positioning capability for target classification waveforms. Target classification efforts include software implementation of target classification capability to support beyond visual range engagements. 

The TPX-57 Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe [IFF] modification kit replaces the current TPX-56 IFF. It also consists of a new router, enhanced Radar Control Terminal (eRCT), Signal Data Processor (SDP) box, and multiple circuit card assemblies. These modifications convert existing A1 radars to the A3 configuration.  Mode 5 provides improvements over Mode 4 in crypto sensitivity, range performance, probability of identification, expanded reply data including position reports, elimination of garbled returns from closely spaced aircraft, friend from foe identification capability, lethal interrogation capability, reduced interference with Civil Air Traffic Control systems, and selective interrogation capability.  Incorporation of Mode 5 into the Sentinel system is critical to retaining the cooperative target identification capability and Sentinel effectiveness on the current/future battlefield, allowing Sentinel to remain operationally effective in Air Defense operations and Homeland Defense missions.  The addition of the eRCT, SDP cards and corresponding SDP box funds the mitigation of obsolescence issues; reliability, availability, and maintainability issues; and operational and hardware issues identified with fielded Sentinel radars.  The eRCT enables remote operations and includes a tactical data recorder needed for Sentinel to support Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar [C-RAM] requirements.  The addition of an Ethernet Router is required to meet Information Assurance requirements for the eRCT and to add Command and Control connectivity to the Sentinel system.

The Common Platform Upgrade will modify the current Sentinel prime mover to a common Army platform to meet Brigade Combat Team [BCT] force protection, as well as meet Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System [IBCS] system requirements.  Transition to a common Army platform is in compliance with Acquisition Decision Memorandum dated August 2011.  The current Sentinel platform does not meet the force protection requirements as defined by the BCT maneuver mission and IBCS operational requirements. 

The North Finding Module [NFM] Upgrade will enhance the system's emplacement accuracy, resulting in improved fire control support and replacement of the obsolete NFM.  

The Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect [EA/EP] addresses the electronic countermeasures [ECM] gap. This effort procures Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) in order to address more extensive EA/EP signatures from evolving threats.

The Signal Data Processor [SDP] Upgrade is a redesign of the SDP backplane to provide higher data throughput to remove current limitations and an upgraded set of SDP cards to remove obsolescence.  Provides for new SDP kit to address obsolescence issues and allow for additional Electronic Protect capability.

The Mode S effort will upgrade existing Sentinel Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) to address objective requirement to interrogate IFF Mode S. In the US, commercial aircraft must transition to Mode S capable units by 2020.  Without the Mode S upgrade, Sentinel will have to rely on aircraft transponders responding to the legacy mode 3/A interrogations.   The data available in the Mode S response will be valuable in identifying the aircraft and correlating Sentinel tracks with civil aviation tracks/data and other track data sources.  Incorporates requirement for the Global Positioning System (GPS) to be M Code capable with the new interrogator.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Night Vision Devices (KA3500) is a summary budget line including the following programs: 
   (1) K36400 - The AN/PSQ-20 Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG) is a lightweight, helmet mounted device that expands a Soldier's Situational Awareness (SA) and lethality by fusing image intensification and long wave infrared into a single, integrated image. Adversaries currently have access to image intensified night vision goggle technology, but not a fused system. The ENVG enables superior combat overmatch capability. The ENVG provides dismounted Brigade Combat Team Warfighters the capability to observe and maneuver in all weather conditions, through obscurants, during limited visibility, and under all lighting conditions including total darkness while enabling rapid detection and engagement with rifle-mounted aiming lasers.  The AN/PSQ-20 supports the tactical level of war; enabling the individual Soldier to see, understand, and act first; permitting superior tactical mobility and decisive engagement during limited visibility conditions.   
   (2) B53800 - This program provides funding to procure Laser Target Locators (LTL).  The Laser Target Locator Modules (LTLM) is a lightweight, handheld, laser target locator with day and thermal sight capability as well as an internal Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. LTLM provides the dismounted observer or Scout a fully digital, handheld system to accurately determine target location and the ability of call for fire during all weather and lighting conditions. LTLM improves speed, accuracy, and safety of use over previous systems of this type (e.g., Laser Target Locator System (LTLS)).  
  
The ENVG Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 66,277; the Army Procurement Objective (APO) is 75,354.

The LTLM AAO is 13,012.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $166,493 million supports the procurement of 12,688 Enhanced Night Vision Goggles, 504 Laser Target Location Modules, and associated fielding costs.

            <proc:Description>The AN/PSQ-23 Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF) is a weapon-mounted, multi-function laser system. It provides an eye safe laser rangefinder, digital compass, Infrared (IR) and visible aiming lights, and an IR illuminator for far target location with continuous range, accuracy, weight and power performance enhanced capabilities. When connected to a Precision Lightweight Global Receiver/Defense Advanced Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver (PLGR/DAGR), the AN/PSQ-23 provides range and direction information to develop accurate and timely far target locations. The STORM addresses the lack of depth perception for night applications through use of its IR illuminator and rangefinder. The STORM system provides a stand-alone capability for small unit leaders and Snipers.  

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for STORM is 24,163.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $13.947 million supports the procurement of 620 STORM systems for fielding to small unit leaders and Snipers.

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $.060 million supports the procurement of 6 STORM systems for equipment replacement.

            <proc:Description>Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance System - Combined (BETSS-C) consists of mobile and semi-fixed sensors providing targeting and surveillance, Force Protection (FP), and Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (CIED) capabilities for 360 degree day and night coverage. This program provides modular and scalable sensor architecture of "plug and play" common components that can be tailored to meet mission specific requirements. The integrated System of Systems (SoS) will be comprised of existing sensor systems that combine to meet the aggregated requirements of stated needs from deployed forces. The BETSS-C Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) program began in 2008 with an overarching Central Command (CENTCOM) Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) which was the combination of multiple JUONS. BETSS-C is a SoS comprised a combination of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR); Battle Command; and FP sensor systems providing tactical commanders with video, images, and other data. The BETSS-C SoS is an evolving FP enterprise architecture with increasing interoperability, robust communications, and a common Command and Control (C2).  The BETSS-C program includes the following systems: Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID), Cerberus Trailers, Cerberus Scout, Force Protection Suite (FPS), Mid-Range Thermal Imagers (MRTI), Rapid Deployment Integrated Surveillance System (RDISS), Standard Ground Surveillance (SGS), Persistent Surveillance System – Ground (Heavy and Medium Platforms), and ancillary equipment.

The BETSS-C sensors are Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components that are a form-fit-function replacements for the legacy sensors.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) Warn program (H30503) evolved from the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) program and is a horizontal technology insertion, using current C-RAM warning capability to provide early, localized warning of indirect fire (IDF) threats to all Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCT).  It employs the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell already resident in the BCT Headquarters as the command and control (C2) element; uses the existing radars in the Target Acquisition Platoon of the Fires Battalion as the Sense element; and adds enhanced warning devices, controllers, and dedicated communications devices between the existing radars, ADAM Cell, and warning systems.  Integration of this equipment provides a Warn capability to the BCTs for detection of threat IDF rounds and transmission of the detection data to the C2 element for correlation and determination of a predicted point of impact (POI).  Based on the POI, the C2 then determines which warning nodes should send "Incoming" warning alarms and transmits this information to the appropriate warning nodes.  In addition to the representative RAM Warn capability fielded to each BCT, Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) equipment sets are being procured to supplement the fielded capability based on mission needs.  Timely warning will enable those BCT personnel in the hazard area of an inbound IDF threat to seek cover or a prone position prior to impact, thus reducing casualties.  The Capability Production Document (CPD) was approved in August 2010, and an update was approved in May 2012, to reflect the name change to RAM Warn.  An initial operational test (IOT) was conducted during November 2012 as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.1, and the RAM Warn Milestone C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision occurred on 19 December 2012.  In April 2014, RAM Warn was approved for entry into the Full Rate Production (FRP) acquisition phase based on successful completion of LRIP exit criteria, including Full Materiel Release.

The C-RAM Intercept program (H30504) provides a counter-RAM capability to the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC)/Avenger battalions, 5-5 and 2-44 Air Defense Artillery (ADA), to defend against and defeat the enduring indirect fire threat.  This capability is provided by fielding existing Land-based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) guns previously produced as a part of the C-RAM quick reaction capability for theater operations; the guns undergo reset prior to fielding.  C-RAM Intercept transitioned to an acquisition program with the approval of the C-RAM Intercept CPD on 22 Aug 2013 and the Army Acquisition Executive's approval of an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 23 Aug 2013, authorizing the program's entry into the acquisition management system as a post-Milestone C, Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program under the management of the Program Executive Officer, Missiles and Space.  Initial issue of LPWS assets to the IFPC/Avenger battalions is ongoing.  A Conditional Materiel Release for LPWS with Spiral 6.0 software was approved on 2 June 2016.  

For transparency and in support of the Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) Statement CC-0558, SSN H30505 was created to support the identification, development, testing, evaluation and integration of technologies to provide an overall evolutionary capability to defeat small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) threats.  The C-UAS effort will provide the capability for the warfighter to comprehensively detect, identify and defeat enemy Group 1 and 2 light weight, low altitude UAS.  The C-UAS effort involves a phased development and testing approach of Counter UAS Systems. The incremental approach provides interim standalone capability within the first few months and achieves a full networked capability by end of two-year JUON period.  To follow is a recap of funding provided in support of  C-UAS JUON CC-0558:

  - Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) approved for the first quarter FY 2017 research and development efforts in the amount of $65.500 million was sourced by FY 2017 OCO Operations and Maintenance (OMA) funds in support of JUON CC-0558.  These funds are being used in support of system engineering, testing, integration, and logistics. 

  - Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) approved for research and development efforts in the amount of $76.000 million starting in late first quarter FY2017 was sourced by FY 2017 OCO Operations and Maintenance (OMA) funds in support of JUON CC-0558.  These funds are being used for development and integration of mobile and expeditionary Low-slow-small UAS Integrated Defeat Systems. 

  - FY 2017 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Other Procurement, Army (OPA) December 2016 Amendment in the amount of $72.000 million supports Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) CC-0558 addressing incremental improvements to deployed capability as informed by test events at each phase.

  - FY 2017 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) December 2016 Amendment in the amount of $78.700 million supports Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) CC-0558 providing test events at each phase to inform incremental improvements to deployed capability.

  - FY 2017 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Other Procurement, Army (OPA) March 2017 Amendment in the amount of $57.750 million supports Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) CC-0558 to develop and test kinetic kill defeat options for integration into the Low-slow-small UAS Integrated Defeat System.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars (H30503) in the amount of $11.380 million provide required RAM Warn BCT fielding/training support and insertion of an enhanced secure communications capability.

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars (H30505) in the amount of $10.000 million to support Network Security Enhancements. These funds will be realigned to the SSN H30504 C-RAM Enhancements line. 

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars (H30505) in the amount of $57.500 million provides expeditionary mobile and static configuration with kinetic defeat capability for integration in to the Low-slow-small UAS Integrated Defeat System (LIDS) in support Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) CC-0558.  This implements the phased approach to improve C-UAS capability over the period of the JUON. These funds will procure and integrate upgraded components for the LIDS as determined by Test Event analysis, kinetic defeat hardware and software components, provide spares, conduct New Equipment Training (NET), as well as provide shipping, transportation, and repairs for deployed systems.

            <proc:Description>Family of Weapons Sights (FWS) consist of Individual (I), Crew-Served (CS), Sniper (S) variants, and the Thermal Weapon Sights (TWS).  The FWS family sights will increase lethality and improve situational awareness by extending the range a Warfighter can recognize potential targets.  The FWS-I reduces target engagement time in both day and night conditions through Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA).  The FWS-CS  will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time by utilizing a Head Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the aim point. A new baby SSN (K22003) FWS-CS is a new start in FY18. The FWS-S will provide greater detection, recognition and aiding in identification at greater ranges during periods of darkness and limited visibility. A new baby SSN (K22004) FWS-S is a new start in FY18.



FWS-I Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) is 36,443
FWS-CS AAO is 25,310
FWS-S AAO is 3,645</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System (IPADS) provided common inertial survey control for all U.S. Army and Marine Corps Field Artillery, Mortar, Artillery Meteorological and Radar systems.  The IPADS, enhanced with the Global Positioning System (GPS) (IPADS-G),  addresses deficiencies of the fire support community by providing the ability to maintain the current accuracy of the IPADS without stopping for zero velocity updates; therefore, increasing artillery timeliness, availability of fires, lethality, survivability, and force protection on extended convoys or artillery missions. The IPADS-G can be aided by an internal GPS receiver; however, it must also be capable of operating in an inertial fashion independently of GPS aiding.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement funds in the amount of $2.129 million supports the fielding and Modification Work Order (MWO) of the IPADS-G Control and Display Unit - Replacement (CDU-R). The CDU-R is a hardware refresh effort to address obsolescence of electronic components. The requested funding supports the fielding of the CDU-R, including essential fielding costs such as engineering support, shipping to and from the contractor location, publications, software updates, and new equipment training. The CDU-R enhances capability for common survey enabling safe, accurate, and lethal fires. The requested funding will also be used to support the Simplified User Interface (SUI) software update and implementation. This software update is being executed to provide a simplified user interface to the IPADS-G framework so that a non-surveyor can easily and successfully operate the IPADS-G with CDU-R.

            <proc:Description>The Profiler Virtual Module (PVM) provides meteorological (MET) data that includes wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity information required for use in the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). The information is necessary for precise targeting and terminal guidance to Field Artillery assets. PVM improves accuracy of predictive fires solutions and allows for first round effects on target and reduces the risk of fratricide. This capability increases the lethality of indirect fire systems such as the rocket launchers, self-propelled or towed howitzers, and mortars.

Procurement support for modifications Profiler Virtual Module (PVM) will continue in the Mod-In-Service Profiler funding line (SSN K27910).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P) is the cornerstone of Joint Forces’ Command and Control (C2), Situational Awareness (SA), and Communications. JBC-P provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability at the Platform and Command Post levels, and continuous near-real-time identification of friendly locations, reported enemy and hazardous locations populating the tactical Common Operating Picture (COP). JBC-P enables Joint, Net-Centric C2/Battle Command by seamlessly passing/sharing relevant information vertically and horizontally, within all tactical levels of command and control. JBC-P is designed to be used on L-Band Satellite Networks and newer terrestrial radios (HMS, MNVR).

The JBC-P program fields hardware (vehicle platform computer systems, satellite transceivers, encryption devices, and ancillary equipment), and software capabilities for the full spectrum of military operations. The Army is preparing to accelerate the fielding of the newest generation of JBC-P computing hardware in order to address an significant cyber vulnerability.  JBC-P will continue to leverage the Army's previous equipment investments by reutilizing satellite transceivers and encryption devices when replacing JV-5 and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) computer hardware.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Fiscal Year 2018 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $282.549 million supports the procurement of 14,675 vehicle platform computer systems, 1,245 Command Post systems, satellite transceivers, encryption devices, ancillary equipment, program management support, training, fielding, publications, support equipment, and Post Deployment Software and Support (PDSS).

Adjustments have been made to the Prior Years in both funding and quantities, effectively driving the Weapon System Unit Cost of JBC-P down.

In FY17, the Army began accelerating fielding of modernized JBC-P hardware and software to get the Army on a common baseline. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) identified this as a top priority, and Army G3/5/7 has approved their request.

Accelerating JBC-P fielding will allow the Army to retire older versions of legacy system Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and Joint Capabilities Release (JCR) hardware and software, which will reduce interoperability issues and maintenance costs of older hardware and software. As newer hardware and software are fielded, the overall cyber resilience of the system will be improved and older, less resilient systems will be retired.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS) Target Locator/Designator System (TLDS) provides the individual dismounted observer an integrated, lightweight, modular capability to detect, identify, accurately locate targets in three dimensions; mark, and designate targets and provide accurate target location coordinates to a forward entry device for engagement with precision munitions. The JETS TLDS is an Army program with joint information (Air Force and Marine Corps). 

JETS will support the Army's Fires Center of Excellence Fires sensor strategy to reduce the number of fires optical targeting systems to two configurations. JETS will satisfy the requirement for the dismounted precision targeting sensor for the individual observer.

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for this program is 3,355.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $48.664 million supports the procurement of 234 Joint Effects Targeting System (JETS).  These systems will be fielded in accordance with the HQDA priority list.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>MOD OF IN-SERVICE EQUIPMENT (LLDR) funds the retrofit of the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder (LLDR, AN/PED-1 and AN/PED-1A) to incorporate target location improvements. The upgraded LLDR system is type classified as an AN/PED-1B (referred to as LLDR 2H). The LLDR is a modular system designed for crew-served, man-portable day/night all-weather use for determining the precise location of threat targets, and for designating threat targets for engagement by Global Position System (GPS) guided and laser guided precision munitions for a variety of Army and Joint weapons systems. The Target Location Module uses a thermal night vision sensor, day camera, laser rangefinder, and digital compass, GPS, and system controller with digital data and video outputs. The Laser Designator Module provides the capability to guide laser-guided munitions and the capability to mark targets for targeting hand-off to aircraft. This effort also replaces earlier Laser Designator Modules with new diode-pumped Laser Designator Modules, reducing weight and power requirements, resulting in lower sustainment costs. The target location improvement retrofit adds a precision azimuth measurement sensor to supplement the digital compass. Target location improvements enable precision target location and engagement with current and future precision munitions by dismounted fire support teams. 

The LLDR with target location improvements will support the Army's Fires Center of Excellence Fires sensor strategy to reduce the number of Fires optical targeting systems to two configurations.  LLDR will continue to fill its role as a crew-served, dismounted precision targeting system and will in the future integrate with Fire Support vehicle mission equipment packages to also serve as the mounted Fires targeting system. Funding in this program supports upgrade of LLDR for increased target location accuracy to facilitate employment of currently fielded GPS guided Precision Munitions by dismounted fire support teams.

The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for this program is 2,700. Only 200 of the AAO were built in the 2H configuration, the remaining 2,500 require retrofit.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $5.198 million supports the program management and engineering support to award a competitive contract for an improved LLDR 3.

FY 2018 OCO procurement dollars in the amount of $3.974 million supports the retrofit of 17 existing LLDR systems with target location improvement for the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI).

            <proc:Description>The M32A1 and M32A2 Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) calculates ballistic solutions that give the mortar user data to aim the mortar weapon, set the charge, and serves as the Fire Direction Center for all mortar platforms. The M32A1 LHMBC communicates digitally on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).  The M32A2 communicates digitally on the newly fielded Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) Fire Support Network. Both the M32A1 and M32A2 LHMBC versions provide firing computations for all calibers of mortars as well as digital messaging capability.  The M32A1 LHMBC will utilize the Ruggedized Tactical Handheld Device (RTHD) platform and will be compatible with Common Operating Environment (COE) 1.0 compliance.  The M32A2 LHMBC will utilize Nett Warrior (NW) Mobile/Handheld (M/HH) platform and will be compatible with COE 3.0 compliance.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>Lightweight Handheld Mortar Ballistic Computer (LHMBC) is a war reserve item used both in training and combat.  FY 2018 request supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with Army procurement goals.  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $8.117 million supports the procurement of 497 each M32A2 LHMBC Nett Warrior (NW) computers and Basic Issue Items (BII).  The M32A2 LHMBC NW with COE Version 3.0 software is urgently needed to replace the obsolete M32 Ruggedized Personal Digital Assistance (RPDA) computers in the field.  LHMBC eliminates the need of paper firing table, improves the accuracy of mortar ballistic calculation, and increases survivability of mortar crews by digitally connecting to the Fire Support network to receive fire missions and Fire Support Coordination Measures to conduct fratricide check.

            <proc:Description>The Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS) accurately determines weapon position and orientation, navigates, calculates ballistics, and communicates digitally on the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) and the newly fielded Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) fire support net.  The MFCS improves the accuracy of the M120 towed mortar system from 138 meters Circular Error Probable (CEP) to 75 meters CEP allowing for first round fire for effect.  MFCS increases survivability of mortar crews by eliminating the need for soldiers to dismount the vehicle to lay out aiming posts.  MFCS also adds digital connectivity to the Fire Support network as well as connectivity to SINCGARS and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) situational awareness blue data.  The MFCS consists of the M95/M96 version that is used on mounted 120mm Mortars in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT) and the M150/M151 version used on the M120A1 120mm Towed Mortar that is fielded throughout all Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT).  The Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) utilize both the M95 and M151 systems.  The M95 is used on the M1064A2/M1064A3 Mortar Carriers with the M121 Battalion Mortar System and the M1129A1 Stryker 120mm Mortar Carrier with the 120mm Recoiling Mortar System.  The M96 is used on M577 Mortar Fire Direction Center (FDC) vehicle.  The M95 and M96  are also being integrated onto the Advanced Multipurpose Vehicle (AMPV) Mortar Carrier and Mission Command vehicles, respectively.  The M150 is used on the M120A1 120mm Towed Mortar that is mounted on the M1101 Trailer.  The M151 is used on the M1097 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HWMMV) that serves as the IBCT and SBCT Mortar FDCs.  Both the M95 and M150 consist of five main components: 1) The Commander's Interface (CI) (M95) or Fire Control Computer (FCC) (M150) links the MFCS components together, communicates, and calculates the ballistic solutions.  2) The Tactical Advanced Land Inertial Navigator (TALIN) is the pointing device and position system that provides the weapon's position, pointing azimuth and elevation.  3) The Gunner's Display (GD) shows the gunner where to point the tube and displays the weapon's azimuth, elevation, and ballistic firing solution.  4) The Driver's Display (DD) (M95 only) provides a "steer-to" display to aid in navigation and emplacement of the vehicle, and 5) The Power Distribution Assembly/Enhanced Power Distribution Assembly filters vehicle power and acts as a circuit breaker isolating MFCS line replaceable units from power fluctuations and surges. The M96 and M151 each consist primarily of the CI (M96) or FCC (M151), installed in the FDC vehicle.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>The Mortar Fire Control System (MFCS) is a war reserve item used both in training and combat.  The FY 2018 request supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army procurement goals.  FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $31.813 million supports the procurement of 72 each M95 Stryker Fire Control Computer (FCC) replacements for Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, 180 each M95 and 30 each M96 Fire Direction Center (FDC) computer replacements for Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT), 47 each M95 AMPV and nine each M96 AMPV, 108 each M150 and 18 each M151 Windows 10 Fire Control Computer with Installation Kit.  These upgrades are urgently required for fielding to 23 Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs), two Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT), and 10 Armor Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT) to retain their MFCS Authority to Operate (ATO) in accordance with Information Assurance requirements.  In addition, without these upgrades and replacements, the MFCS within the IBCTs, ABCTs, and SBCTs will not be able to maintain interoperability with the Fire Support Network software in phase with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) requirements.

            <proc:Description>The AN/TPQ-53 Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and will replace the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system interoperates with mission command systems (MCSs) to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-53 is fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).  

Current force structure is:
 - Two (2) radars per Active Component (AC) Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT)
 - Two (2) radars per AC Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT)
 - Two (2) radars per AC Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT)
 - Two (2) radars per Army National Guard (ARNG) ABCT
 - Two (2) radars per ARNG IBCT
 - Two (2) radars per ARNG SBCT
 - Two (2) radars per AC Field Artillery Brigade (FAB)
 - Two (2) radars per ARNG FAB
 - Two (2) radars per AC Division Artillery (DIVARTY)
 - One (1) radar per Task Force

            <proc:Description>Fire Support Command and Control (FSC2) systems automate the planning and execution of fire support operations so that a suitable weapon or group of weapons adequately covers targets. Fire support is the effects of lethal and non-lethal weapons (fires) that directly support land, maritime, amphibious and special operation forces to engage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives. FSC2 family consists of Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS), and Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED).

Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) is a Joint and Coalition targeting, coordination mission management software application. It links Command and Control (C2), Intelligence, and Air Operations information with execution systems using real time collaborative targeting managers, customized for each service or specific functional area. JADOCS is used to significantly enhance the Joint Force and Component Command's capability to simultaneously develop, coordinate and execute Dynamic and Time Sensitive targets and fire missions, as well as battle space coordination worldwide. JADOCS provides coordination and de-confliction of targeting information at all levels of command structure for the military.  JADOCS is used by Air, Ground, Maritime, and Special Operations forces. It provides horizontal (across Services) as well as vertical (within Services) coordination of missions to ensure a common picture of targeting operational status across the entire joint force. As a software application, JADOCS can be configured and customized for each user and location. 

The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications. AFATDS is used to plan, execute,  and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects. AFATDS provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapons systems. As a member of the Artillery System Cooperation Agreement (ASCA), AFATDS is interoperable with coalition partner fire support systems. AFATDS automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).

The Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) (Inc I) is a handheld hardware device that enables rapid precision Sensor-to-Shooter and Surveillance capabilities.  PFED is fully interoperable with AFATDS and current fire support systems.  Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) is an Army Objective Force System that provides integration of Air and Missile Defense (AMD) operations at all echelons.  AMDPCS systems are deployed with Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Brigades (Bdes), Army Air Missile Defense Commands (AAMDCs), and Air Defense and Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells at the Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Multi-Functional Support Brigades, Corps and Divisions.  AMDPCS systems also provide air defense capabilities to Homeland Defense systems. The fielding of ADAM Cells is essential in fulfilling the Army's Campaign Plan requirement.  ADAM Cells provide the Commander at BCTs, Bdes and Divisions with air defense situational awareness and airspace management capabilities.  They also provide the interoperability link with Joint, multinational and coalition forces.  AMDPCS components are vital in the transformation of ADA units.  AMDPCS provides these organizations with shelters, automated data processing equipment, tactical communications, standard vehicles and tactical power, and the two major software systems used in air defense force operations/engagement operations: The Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS) and the Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI).  The AMDWS is a staff planning and battlespace situational awareness tool that provides commanders at all echelons with a common tactical and operational air picture.  The AMDWS is being fielded to all AMDPCS units, including the ADA Bdes, the AAMDCs and the ADAM Cells, as well as to the Maneuver Air and Missile Defense Battalions and Batteries.  AMDWS provides the Mission Command (MC) capabilities imbedded within the Warfighter Mission area.  AMDWS is the Net-centric interface to MC for all components of the AMD force.  AMDPCS also provides the ADA Brigades, AAMDCs and ADAM Cells with the ADSI, which is a communications data link processor and an additional display system. AMDWS and ADSIs are vital components of the ADAM Cells that are deployed in Afghanistan.  AMDWS is a critical component in the integration and fielding of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) capability to Operating Bases in Afghanistan, Iraq and Egypt.

Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) for AMDPCS shelter systems is 225.  OPA OCO European Reassurance Initiatives (ERI) and Grow the Army (GTA) requirements are in addition to AAO.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Program is a direct response to the U.S. Army AMD Concept and Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Plan for the Future Force, the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense System of Systems (SoS) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) and the new Air and Missile Defense Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS).   The AIAMD Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching system of systems (SoS) capability with all participating Air Defense Artillery (ADA) components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing (1) the IAMD Battle Command Systems (IBCS) Engagement Operations Center (EOC) that provides the common Mission Command capability, (2) the Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire control connectivity and distributed operations, and (3) the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) Kits that network enable multiple sensor components, weapon components, and the IBCS EOC.

The AIAMD Program will provide advanced capabilities to the Army and the soldier by allowing transformation to a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as "Plug and Fight") that integrates Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) sensors and weapons with the IBCS EOC.  The AIAMD SoS architecture will enable extended range and non-line-of-sight engagements, to include joint kill chain engagements across the full spectrum of aerial threats, providing fire control quality data to the most appropriate weapon to complete the mission successfully.  Further, it will mitigate the coverage gaps and the single points of failure that have plagued AMD defense design in the past.  The AIAMD program will provide the user with the ability to train on a single C2 system that will result in overall training savings. The AIAMD program will also provide the Army with the ability to procure components that will build to established interfaces allowing them to "connect" to the IFC network alleviating the cost of procuring total system capabilities in the future. 

The Initial Operational Capability is delivered through the fielding of the IBCS EOC-based AIAMD architecture, including the IBCS EOC, Sentinel and Patriot components connected via an IFCN, working in an integrated manner. Additional capabilities include the incorporation of IBCS functionality into Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) components, Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cells, ADA Brigade Headquarters, Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) Headquarters, and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries. 

AIAMD is a designated Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP).</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>Life Cycle Software Engineering (LCSE) support, by the Software Engineering Center (SEC), provides the essential equipment needed to maintain Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) managed fielded Battlefield Automated Systems (BAS) in a state of operational readiness.  Approximately 100 BASs in Post Production Software Support (PPSS) directly depend on LCSE support to maintain a posture of mission critical readiness.  LCSE system support and services are essential to maintain BASs in the state of operational readiness.  Policy for Post Production Software Support (PPSS) requires that system managers provide initial host capabilities for new systems and that the Life Cycle Software Engineering Centers (LCSEC) provide upgrades and replacement of obsolete equipment.  Significant portions of host and network equipment are no longer economically repairable and/or are reaching obsolescence.  There is a requirement to respond to emergency requests from the field for Software Engineering support, in order to maintain operational readiness of deployed BASs.  With host computers and peripherals having a life span of approximately five years and SEC performing its mission over a continuous period of time beyond five years, equipment must be replaced and/or upgraded regularly to deal with obsolescence and take advantage of the continual improvements in technology that are indigenous to high-technology based weapon systems and their software support environments.  SEC must purchase these items to meet systems mission requirements.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $1.992 million supports the requirement to provide software engineering support to maintain operational readiness of deployed BASs.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Network Management Initialization and Services (NMIS) program supports the Army's objectives of an integrated Network Operations capability.  There are two components to the program:  

The Network Management System (NMS) project funds the Network Operations (NetOps) Trail Boss systems engineering support to converge NetOps and Cyber capabilities across the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT)) in order to enable improved network security and delivery of network operations services to the Generating Forces and Operating Forces of the Army. Integrated Cyber and NetOps capabilities support distributed operational NetOps responsibilities across the tactical and strategic components of the US Army enterprise network (LANDWARNET), simplify the network management environment for the tactical commander and the G6/S6 staff, and eliminate both functional and material redundancies in order to achieve efficiencies in fielding.
 
Data Products are required to initialize Army Tactical Mission Command Systems.  Data Products are a collection of information/data required to plan and initialize Mission Command Systems like Joint Battle Command - Platform (JBC-P), Command Post of the Future (CPOF) and other Army Mission Command Systems.  Information/Data includes: JBC-P database, Network Operation Center (NOC) databases, and Active Directory initialization files (e.g., Lightweight Directory Interchange Format (LDIFs)).  Data Products enable end-to-end network centric connectivity and interoperability across the tactical internet.   AAO is N/A.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>In FY 2018, the NetOps Trail Boss will work integration of NetOps and Cyber program functionality with the Command Post Computing Environment to support version 3 deployment in FY19-20 timeframe. 

FY 2018 Base procurement dollars, in the amount of $5.006 million, provides Government, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), and contractor systems engineering support to execute the duties as an integration/interoperability/convergence manager for the Army's NetOps portfolio in accordance with the ASA(ALT) Integrated NetOps Trail Boss designation memo, dated 26 July 2012, in order to integrate and converge NetOps capabilities and provide more effective network capability to the Warfighter. These duties include conducting and documenting technical assessments of Cyber and NetOps capabilities and gaps; developing and coordinating NetOps capability roadmaps across key Army stakeholders; developing interoperability specifications, supporting development of Cyber and NetOps requirement documents and program strategies, recommending realignment of resources to execute Army NetOps priorities; and updating and maintaining the Army NetOps Capability Configuration Management process. These duties include developing system engineering products and guiding program strategy alignment between emerging Defensive Cyber Operations efforts and existing NetOps programs.

FY 2018 Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $10.173 million procure 6.5 non-Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), Software Block (SWB) 2, SWB 11-12, and Capability Set (CS) 13 and newer (e.g., CS14/15/16) Data Product Networking Initialization products that support the Army Forces Generation (ARFORGEN) model, Unit Set Fielding (USF) priority and top Army priorities for deployment, training, and reset.  It also procures the fielding, training, and support of the Initialization Tool Suite (ITS) which includes Warfighter Initialization Tool - Platform (WIT-P), Warfighter Initialization Tool - Server (WIT-S), and Warfighter Initialization Tool - Manager (WIT-M), and utilization of the Automated Initialization Manager (AIM).  FY 2018 Funding will begin a shift from static data production to initialization being managed by the unit with simultaneous fieldings of ITS at both the upper and lower tactical internet (UTI/LTI).  Static data products are still required for the large majority of FY 2018 planned unit upgrades.  Data Products are essential for Blue Force Tracker (BFT) Situational Awareness data, for tactical digital messaging (e.g., Improvised Explosive Device (IED) awareness, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Call for Fire, etc.) and automated Command and Control (C2) to function.

            <proc:Description>Tactical Mission Command (TMC), a Major Automation Information System funded by the Maneuver Control System (MCS) line, consists of products and services that provide commanders and their staff situational awareness and executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment above platform level. The TMC portfolio includes Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Web, and Wave VoIP. The TMC suite is the implementation of essential warfighting functions that incorporate a common look and feel, to application based capabilities leveraging common services and infrastructure which are Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant. TMC is procuring the Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI), which replaces legacy Battle Command Common Services (BCCS) and Intelligence Fusion Server (IFS) infrastructure solutions, thereby supporting all warfighting functions on a single server solution. The TSI server solution streamlines training and support across the signal and intelligence communities.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement in the amount of $132.572 million supports purchase of 4,891 TMC Clients/laptops, other hardware (Battle Command Common Services (BCCS)/Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) servers, Server Management Consoles, and Gateways), and associated fielding support which will ensure that the Warfighter will be able to communicate effectively allowing for increased situational awareness and executive decision making capability in a collaborative environment above platform level.

            <proc:Description>Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) consists of two funding subcomponents; Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) Tactical Computers (STACOMP)and Army Enterprise System Integration Program (AESIP).  

GCSS-Army will modernize tactical logistics by implementing a web based and commercial best business practices system to streamline supply and maintenance, property accountability, and logistics management and integration procedures in all tactical units of the Army. GCSS-Army will provide a comprehensive solution for meeting the day-to-day needs of tactical level logistics, logistics finance operations and statutory auditability requirements. GCSS-Army will enable Commanders to obtain an integrated, interoperable view of the sustainment situation in the battle-space in sufficient time to support decisions that will affect the outcome of combat operations, combat power and planning for future operations.  

The Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP), mission is to integrate Army business processes by providing a single source for enterprise hub services, centralized master data management, and business intelligence and analytics. AESIP will support the Army's federated approach and enable the integration of end-to-end logistical and financial processes. The AESIP solution establishes a framework for a fully integrated ERP centric environment that will ultimately provide Commanders Total Asset Visibility from Factory to Battlefield thereby ensuring delivery of the right equipment to the right unit at the right time, while reducing backlogs of material on the battlefield.

Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence / Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers. Upon the completion of Increment II, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by GCSS-Army increments. GCSS-Army will provide the Army sustainment support for the warfighter with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible and secure management information that gives combat forces a decisive edge.


GCSS-Army is a designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 18 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $33.334 million supports GCSS-Army Wave 2 fielding and training support for the final deployment of the system to the remaining Wave 2 units in the Army via fielding groups. The GCSS-Army funding supports procurement of hardware and software required for the full deployment and implementation of an Enterprise Business Intelligence solution and a Database Management System; standard hardware refresh for the Program Management Office as well as allows for the replacement of out-of-warranty hardware; built out of the ERP enclave in support of the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) initiatives and the implementation of the SAP High-Performance Analytic Appliance (HANA). SAP HANA begets the acceleration of replication and ingestion of structured data from relational databases, applications, and other systems quickly. 

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities

FY 18 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $3.867 million supports procurement of hardware, software, and user licenses for initial limited deployment for Increment 2.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The IPPS-A provides the Army with an integrated, multi-component, military personnel and pay system which streamlines Army Human Resources (HR), enhances the efficiency and accuracy of Army personnel and pay procedures, and supports Soldiers and their families.  The IPPS-A will subsume approximately 43 Army legacy systems across the Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard, into an integrated system.  The IPPS-A is a web-based tool, available 24 hours a day, accessible to HR professionals, combatant commanders, personnel and pay managers, and other authorized users throughout the Army.  IPPS-A addresses major deficiencies in the delivery of military personnel and pay services and also provides internal controls and audit procedures that prevent erroneous payments and loss of funds.

IPPS-A Increment II will deliver full integrated personnel and pay services for all Army Components, building on the trusted database delivered by the IPPS-A Increment I program. Increment II will be able to link the personnel and pay functions for all Army personnel, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing complex system maintenance, and minimizing pay discrepancies. IPPS-A Increment II will account for status changes between Active, Reserve, and National Guard components to ensure accurate service time minimizing impact on individual pay, credit for service, and other benefits as well as enable disciplined human resource management.

IPPS-A Increment I and Increment II are both designated Major Automation Information System (MAIS) programs.</proc:Description>

            <proc:Description>The Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (commonly known as ENFIRE) is a Digital technical stand off engineering and data collection tool set, designed to perform reconnaissance, obstacle reporting, construction management, and  surveying using precision measuring devices in conjunction with a tablet computer that contains user friendly Geographic Information System (GIS) to auto populate Road, Bridge, Minefield, and UXO report forms.  It allows greater accuracy and precision of measurements and faster, automatic information collection and less error-prone dissemination. ENFIRE is Common Joint Mapping Tool Kit (CJMTK) compatible for geospatial interoperability and allows data collection from a distance, minimizing exposure to enemy observation; greatly improving safety to soldiers. ENFIRE kits are comprised of commercial off the shelf equipment

ENFIRE incorporates the ability to automatically populate field data on digital forms used for road, bridge, hasty minefield, ford, tunnel and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) reconnaissance/reporting with relevant information from peripheral devices included in the ENFIRE set. ENFIRE sets are used at the Battalion, Company, Platoon, and Squad levels as a means to facilitate rapid collection and dissemination of information to commanders in the field.   Information may be disseminated via the Battle Command Common Services to other ENFIRE sets and to other Mission Command (MC) and Intelligence systems. ENFIRE also has broad area application as a common computing platform for the engineer platoon; with plans to incorporate research and development efforts that have application across Military and General Engineering disciplines.

The long distance laser range finder allows soldiers to quickly and accurately determine a target's bearing and distance from the users' location at a significant standoff range.   Used in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver and ArcMap software, ENFIRE users are able to create overlays of bridges, roads, hasty minefields, and IEDs on digital maps as they collect information related to these targets.   Using the video camcorder and digital scanner, ENFIRE users can also collect picture and scanned image files that can be associated with bridge, road, hasty minefield and IED information for reporting purposes. Reports can be generated in hard or soft copy for rapid dissemination.

            <proc:Description>Army Training Modernization (ATM) consists of three related efforts to include Distributive Training Technology Project (DTTP), Other Training Modernization, and the Distributed Learning System (DLS) to acquire Digital Training Facilities (DTF).  DTFs allow rapid delivery of high quality instruction to Army personnel. Infrastructure acquired is based on industry standards and complies with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE), where applicable. This assures compatibility with other military services and that commercial, state, and other resources can be leveraged to achieve cost effective solutions to support all Army components.

ATM provides a cost effective solution for training Army personnel. Supported training enhancements will help reduce the current backlog of Military Operational Specialty (MOS) training. Army can significantly increase levels of MOS qualification, hence readiness, with standardized Army courseware delivered through Distributed Learning (DL) technology. Implementation of these technology enablers reduce resident training requirements and Soldiers spend less time in the training base and more time in units, thereby increasing readiness. ATM delivers standardized training to Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) Soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians (DAC). 

The DTTP/DLS provide infrastructure for Soldiers to train at or near their assigned station in lieu of resident training at Army schools.  DTTP and DLS will provide approximately 549 modern distance learning (DL) enabled DTFs and associated supporting infrastructure to augment training at existing resident Army schools. Moreover, DLS has fielded 30 Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC) to allow training while units are deployed. This allows Army to both increase the number of Army personnel receiving required training and the amount of training that can be provided to each individual. 

DLS provides the information technology for delivery and management of training in support of individual and collective task training.  Benefits include increased training effectiveness and efficiency, improved readiness, and increased training for customers. Key customers: Soldiers (Active, National Guard, and Reserve) and Army Civilians.  Key Stakeholders: Army Training and Doctrine Command (Functional Proponent Agent), all other Army Commands, Program Executive Officer - Enterprise Information Systems, and Army General Staff.  DLS provides capabilities using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions: (1) Digital Training Facilities (DTF): electronic classrooms that deliver multimedia courseware for self-paced training or group training events; (2) Enterprise Management Center (EMC): centralized system management of the DLS information resources; (3) Army Learning Management System (ALMS): a web-based information system for centralizing, standardizing, and optimizing training, training management, and training delivery functions; (4) Deployed Digital Training Campuses (DDTC): electronic transportable classrooms that deliver multimedia courseware for self-paced instruction or group training events in a deployed location; and,  (5) Army e-Learning: web-based training products used to acquire and sustain business, information technology or foreign language skills.  As a whole, DLS facilitates the Training Mission Area mission to teach technical and tactical proficiency, develop military occupational specialty (MOS) skills, develop Leaders, support Army Training Transformation, Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) and Lifelong Learning, promote self-development, and sustain individual and unit combat skills.

The United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) trains Military Intelligence (MI) Soldiers, Leaders from all services, the professional civilian Intelligence workforce and mobilized reserve components as a power support platform for the Active Army.  Because of Military Intelligence’s reliance on Information Technology, information systems are the primary weapons for the Military Intelligence Corps, and a digital infrastructure that comprises the systems, networks, and databases that MI Soldiers and Leaders will use in the Force is required for training.  The USAICoE G-6 is chartered with continuously maintaining and improving this vital digital training infrastructure, which encompasses 5 discreet network enclaves, each operating at different levels of classification, 25 training buildings, 4 field sites, 325 digital classrooms, and 3 data centers.  The USAICoE G-6 operates and maintains the largest single site installation of Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A).</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 (BE4171) Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.710 million supports system integration and technical refresh for 18 of the Program’s 334 DL Classrooms. Many of the DL Classrooms have workstations, audio/video equipment, and printers that are well past their end of life and need technical refresh to comply with heightened Cybersecurity standards and new network infrastructure to ensure their continued availability and capability to meet current and emerging training and readiness requirements for the ARNG’s State and Federal missions.

FY 2018 (BE4172) Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.382 million supports the United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence Soldiers and Leaders from all services with network equipment including servers, firewalls, and other related hardware for the Distributed Common Ground System-Army infrastructure. 

FY 2018 (BE4173) Base procurement dollars in the amount of $2.483 million funds the DLS Enterprise Technology Refreshment (Tech Refresh) program in support of all increments (Digital Training Facilities (DTF), Enterprise Management Center (EMC), Army Learning Management System (ALMS), and Deployed Digital Training Campus (DDTC)).  Tech Refresh extends the service life by staying ahead of the obsolescence curve with cost-effective planned technology upgrades, refreshers, and insertions, based on market research and system performance requirements (current and projected).  With the advance of information technology, it is critical that Tech Refresh be maintained to assure continued supportability of the DLS Enterprise and to avoid disruption of Army Training.  Funds are also needed for software and engineering changes required to enhance the ALMS assessment capabilities.  This will expand the automated capability for the creation, storage, management, and administration of online testing and course product evaluations (including surveys) to support Army Soldier and civilian training and education.

            <proc:Description>The General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) is a Major Automated Information System (MAIS) (ACAT-IAC) project that replaced antiquated financial systems including the Standard Finance Systems (STANFINS), Standard Operations and Maintenance, and Army R&amp;D System (SOMARDS). GFEBS is the Department of the Army's enterprise financial and asset management system. GFEBS is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC). GFEBS is fielded to more than 53,000 trained users at over 227 installations worldwide and is the Army's enterprise solution in accounting and financial management. GFEBS provides improved functionality in general fund core financial functions including: general ledger management; financial reporting; real property, plant, and equipment accountability; reimbursable, revenue, and accounts receivable; cost management; funds control and budgetary accounting; accounts payable; and audit trails and system controls and meets legislative mandates to develop an auditable financial system. The primary objectives for the GFEBS financial management system are to provide an integrated off the shelf capability for general fund management for the Army that meets requirements for auditability, and to improve performance, standardize business processes, ensure capability exists to meet future needs, and provide Army's decision makers with relevant, reliable, and timely information.

GFEBS-Sensitive Activities (SA) provides a classified version of the GFEBS program developed to process data in a secure environment to protect and manage classified data. GFEBS-SA will integrate seamlessly with GFEBS and provide a secure, web-based, financial asset and accounting management system to Army classified, intelligence, and special access programs.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $4.465 million supports software and hardware infrastructure upgrades, to bring GFEBS reporting and analytics in line with processing performance thresholds established in the GFEBS Capabilities Production Document(CPD); to support auditability and compliancy requirements.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program, managed by the Army, supports the needs of all services for technological superiority and military dominance on the battlefield by providing advanced computational services to U.S. weapons system scientists and engineers.  By exploiting continuous advances in high performance computing technology, the Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community is able to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems quickly and with more precision.  The results of these efforts feed directly into the acquisition process by improving weapons system designs through an increased fundamental understanding of materials, aerodynamics, chemistry, fuels, acoustics, signal image recognition, electromagnetics, and other areas of basic and applied research as well as enabling advanced test and evaluation environments that allow synthetic scene generation, automatic control systems and virtual test environments.  As such, HPC has been identified as a key enabling technology essential to achieving the objectives of the DoD's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) programs.  The program deploys supercomputers to provide world-class high performance computing (HPC) capability to a nation-wide user community.

The HPC Modernization program provides focused modernization efforts crafted to ensure DoD's S&amp;T and T&amp;E communities are supported with current generation supercomputing capabilities.  The HPC modernization program resulted from congressional language that recognized supercomputing as a national strategic asset and directed the DoD to focus on supercomputing modernization at laboratories and test centers to keep its forces and military systems on the leading technological edge.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $58.363 million supports two large supercomputers for two DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DRSC) locations, Army Research Laboratory (ARL) located in Aberdeen, MD., and the Engineer Research and Development Center DSRC located in Vicksburg, MS. 

FY 2018 Base procurement in the amount of $8.000 million will support four (4) DoD HPC Project Investments for Army, Navy, and Air Force initiatives requiring unique specifications or computing classification above SECRET.</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Army Contract Writing System (ACWS) will be the Army's single, next-generation, enterprise-wide contract writing, management, execution, and close-out software system. ACWS will facilitate the standardization of Army Procurement business processes and streamline the integration with Army ERP systems. As a financial feeder system, ACWS will meet the compliance requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). The system will meet the full scope of Army Contracting requirements, including those in secure and non-secure locations, those supporting combat or non-combat contingencies, those within or outside the borders of the Continental United States, those supporting grants and assistance agreements, and those performing weapons systems, construction, installation, and other specialized contracting activities. 

This is consistent with Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Memorandum; Department of Defense (DoD) Functional Contract Writing and Administration, dated 21 October 2011, which directed each of the Services to develop a new contract writing system. Accordingly, Army received an OSD Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO) validated problem statement and the Army Acquisition Executive approved the ACWS Materiel Development Decision (MDD) on 29 October 2014. On 24 March 2016, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology re-designated the ACWS as an ACAT IAM (MAIS) program and authorized the release of the RFP to procure a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) system. ACWS just completed an aggressive Source Selection and conducted an Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) meeting with the Army Acquisition Executive in March 2017, and received approval from the Defense Acquisition Executive to proceed to contract award in April 2017.  Contract Award is anticipated in May 2017.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY2018 procurement funding supports ACWS software licenses and system fielding activities (Organization Change Management) for Build 1 (TO 002) in the Development and Deployment phase. The licenses procurement is aligned to our deployment schedule, and if not funded ACWS will be unable to fully deploy the system to all end users and retire Legacy systems. This will result in extending the program schedule and increasing total program costs (overhead).</proc:Justification>

            <proc:Description>The Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) is an automated information system that provides the capability to administer, manage, and mobilize the Army's Reserve Component (RC) forces more effectively. Specifically, RCAS supports the mobilization planning and unit administration functions of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve by integrating commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and office automation software, Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software, and developed functional software applications into a common operating environment, personal computer based architecture.  Since completion of the infrastructure and functional capabilities, system acquisition has been focused on the effective and efficient sustainment of the fielded system and software applications. The RCAS hardware infrastructure is refreshed on a five year cycle, replacing approximately 20% of the fielded infrastructure per year.

The program supports the Army and DoD objectives of network convergence to Unified Capabilities and is aligned with the Joint Information Environment initiative by providing the transport infrastructure.

RCAS is the Army's system of choice and record for all RC Commands mobilizing their citizen soldiers for disaster response, homeland security tasking, and overseas deployment.  Established in response to a Government Accountability Office report on the Army Reserve Component's inability to provide timely and accurate mobilization data, the system now dramatically improves the Army's and the states' ability to organize, train, and equip their citizen soldiers, mobilize forces in half the historical time required, and provides resource visibility to state and federal agencies of all forces at home and abroad.  RCAS has been successfully utilized in response to 9/11, Homeland Security missions, National Training exercises, Disaster Relief, and Operations Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, Enduring Freedom and Freedom's Sentinel.</proc:Description>
            <proc:Justification>FY 2018 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $26.183 million will support refreshment of approximately 17 percent of the RCAS hardware infrastructure, placing the information technology infrastructure refresh on a 6 year cycle.  The program will support hardware and software refresh to Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve commands and units based on priorities established by the respective Components. The program will satisfy agency information technology mandates with respect to information assurance, net worthiness, server consolidation, and a common operating environment.

In accordance with Section 1815 of the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 110-181), this item is necessary for use by the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces for homeland defense missions, domestic emergency responses, and providing military support to civil authorities.</proc:Justification>

This equipment supports the survey mission of both the Topographic and Construction Engineer.  Capabilities provided by this equipment enable engineers to establish the geodetic control necessary for construction and topographic surveys with centimeter level precision in electronic contested environments. GPS-S integrates Selective Availability, Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) and Precise Positioning System GPS software upgrades into a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) GPS for military survey applications. Additionally, this equipment supports Construction Engineering surveys (e.g., roads, buildings, logistics sites, staging areas, airfield construction).  Software functionality, included as part of this procurement, allows the user to accomplish the design work necessary for site design and construction (e.g., materiel calculations, labor, resources). GPS-S interfaces with current Army Survey equipment to perform integrated GPS/optical surveys. Leverages the Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying (ENFIRE) tablet PC to post process survey data files and import survey design files. GPS-S meets FAA standards for airfield survey and allows for standardized commercial data exchanges such that it is interoperable with commercial SW and HW equivalents. GPS-S kits are comprised of commercial off the shelf equipment.

BCT Emerging Technologies also supports the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) efforts to provide capabilities to improve future solutions, to inform future Army capability requirements, and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.  The Army RCO expedites the provisioning and fielding of critical combat materiel capabilities to the Warfighter to meet Combatant Commanders’ needs. The Army RCO was established per Headquarters, Department of the Army, memo, SUBJECT: Establishment of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, signed by the Secretary of the Army: Eric K. Fanning, dated 11 August 2016.  The RCO assesses Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The- Shelf (GOTS), and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) (non-standard equipment) solutions for modification and/or integration to address changes in contested environments with enduring materiel solutions for forces deployed globally. Procure prototypes and evaluate solutions to be fielded and transition to an acquisition program for production and sustainment.</proc:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army training and developmental and operational tests. This PE originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories and hardware/simulation in-the-loop facilities. Army threat simulator and threat simulation products developed or fielded under this PE support Army-wide, non-system specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army and tri-service capabilities to eliminate duplication of products and services, while providing the proper mix of resources needed to support Army testing and training. These battlefield simulators represent systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) that are used to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Threat Simulator Investment Working Group.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element funds aerial and ground target hardware and software development, maintenance, and upgrades. The overall objective is to ensure validation of weapon system accuracy and reliability by developing aerial and ground targets essential for test and evaluation (T&amp;E). These targets are economical and expendable, remotely controlled or stationary, and often destroyed in use. The Army is the Tri-Service lead under the Secretariat Reliance panel for providing rotary wing, mobile ground, towed, and designated targets for T&amp;E. The Army executes development of some service-peculiar target requirements in support of quality assurance, lot acceptance, and training and continues development of service-peculiar and on-going target materiel upgrades to maintain continuity with current weapons technology and trends in modern and evolving Army weapons.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aerial Targets Project supports Army readiness through development, acquisition, operation and modernization of aerial targets.  Multi-spectral Aerial Targets include realistic surrogates, actual high performance threat aircraft, and virtual target computer models.  Current and emerging weapons systems require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess weapons systems effectiveness in the operational environment. This program encompasses a portfolio of full-scale, miniature, and subscale fixed wing/rotary wing targets; virtual targets; ancillary devices; and associated control systems.  For accurate threat portrayal that properly stresses weapons systems during test and evaluation aerial targets must exhibit the flight characteristics, threat signatures, and other performance factors to represent or emulate relevant and validated threats.   This Project resources the long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirements; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation, production, and modernization; execution of the validation process to ensure that aerial targets accurately represent the threat; as well as storage and repair parts.   The Army is the Test Enterprise Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and Towed Target development and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing High Speed Aerial Target.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This PE also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation.  Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS).  Funds modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.  Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability.  The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test &amp; evaluation assessments and operational decisions for the Army; Navy; Air Force; United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM); Missile Defense Agency (MDA); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). 

Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ROSA Refresh plan is to incorporate subsystem technologies at GBR-P, then transition those technologies to the other RTS sensors. Much of the testing and integration lessons will be learned ahead of time, providing a drop-in updated solution for legacy ROSA components at the other radars identified as having long-term sustainability issues. In this approach, the ROSA refresh effort is coupled with the GBR-P modernization leading to a cleaner and more cost-effective program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This Project will develop the technology required to modernize the telemetry systems using an innovative software defined radio approach designed to vastly improve the ability to adapt to future telemetry changes and requirements quickly with lower cost. In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry backend processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency-specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This project will develop a scalable frequency agnostic software based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, which this project will avoid much of that future cost. This project will provide enough hardware to increase capacity of the telemetry system.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>As missions become more complex and challenging, the operator workload increases significantly. This Project improves automation and decision support to reduce human operator workload and operator errors associated with a higher workload. There will be additional capabilities to operate the range as a cohesive meta-sensor and capabilities to program contingencies, react with a priori information and decision algorithms and resource brokers. This will improve mission assurance. The RTS radar control software will be upgraded to automate processes that computers do better than humans, and reduce the need for labor intensive tuning efforts. The human computer interface (HCI) for the radars will be improved to allow operators to interact with the RTS sensor suite more intuitively with a small set of high-level commands. The control center data fusion algorithms will be improved and streamlined to reduce complexity and decrease operator workload.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Net-Centric Operations is a DoD mandate to enable agility through sharing of data across mission areas and components. Sharing of data is enabled by using standards where appropriate, forming communities of interest (COI) to agree on common vocabularies, common computing services infrastructure on a single network, and robust dynamic security access control.  This Project will improve on how RTS interacts to receive Inter-range vectors (IRVs) from other ranges (e.g., Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB)) to establish the connectivity and messaging required to avoid antiquated point-to-point connections over Secure Telephone Equipment (STE). This would leverage Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) and Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) networks and RTS Distributed Operations (RDO) and Test Enabling Network Architecture (TENA) based data messages, but will also consider operational systems that are needed for RTS to participate more fully in real world events by sharing data and cues. A prototype TENA gateway will be the first phase in connecting RTS to other ranges with this new paradigm.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the development, acquisition, and integration of major operational test instrumentation for the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) Operational Test Command and supporting test activities at test and training ranges. Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems.  Program focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) identified Army test realism shortfalls.
FY18 funds will be used for Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) in support of PM Apache, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Rifleman Radio. 

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.

Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army’s abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&amp;E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite  that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future, weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), encryption components, and integrates operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), M1A2, M2A4, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) was realigned within this Program Element from Project 984/Major Developmental Testing Instrumentation to Project EY9/RRRP.  RRRP transferred to Program Executive Office (PEO) Missiles and Space (M&amp;S) for completion of mission.  Prior development effort was funded in Army Program Element (APE) 0604756 / Project 984.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The RRRP develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) Developmental Test Command (DTC) activities which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ.  The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army critical testing data essential for the development of complex next generation technology and advanced system capabilities.  The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability.  The planned solution for the program requirements is a modular open architecture system consisting of four primary items: a Long Range Radar (LRR), a Medium Range Radar (MRR), a Short Range Radar (SRR), and a Radar Operations Console (ROC).  The resulting system will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers.

The Project will procure Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions along with a COTS replacement for the FPS-16 LRR.  Also, the program will conduct EMD for upgrading three MPS-39 LRRs and the ROC.

FY18 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for the RRRP Block One (I) LRR and ROC systems in preparation for replacement of equipment at ATC, RTC, WSTC and YTC.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis.  The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or Senior Executive Service (SES) equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) is unique in the Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) portfolio due to the comprehensive scope of RDTE Installations Management responsibilities on Army Kwajalein Atoll. These responsibilities include provision of the totality of Municipal Services required to maintain a strategically vital Army Garrison and mission support infrastructure in a logistically challenging remote Pacific island chain. 

The United States (U.S.) Army Kwajalein Atoll/Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) supported by US Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA).  USAKA/RTS supports test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs and provides space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  USAG-KA provides Base Operations (BOS), Infrastructure and Services support to the USAKA/RTS mission and other resident Programs.  These programs include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational/demonstration/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments.  Operations at Kwajalein Atoll are predominantly government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) and are dependent upon associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M).  The PE funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.   The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA space experiments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project resources Base Operations/Installation Services Support for United States (U.S.) Army Kwajalein (USAKA) located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a remote, secure activity designated as a Major Range and Test Facility Base.  Kwajalein is a government-managed/contractor-operated site and is primarily dependent upon its associated support contracts for the daily operations and maintenance of Base Ops/Installation Services Support.  Installation Services Support consists of Medical/Dental Services; Education (K-12) Services; Food/Grocery Services; Contracted Security Guards; Aviation/Marine support; and logistical (fuel/transportation) operations support requirements.  Base Operations/Installation Services Support resourcing is a critical enabler to ensure continuity of operations supporting Test and Evaluation and Space Operations of the Reagan Test Site in its role as a Major Range and Test Facility Base Activity.

For Fiscal Year (FY) 16, the "Municipal Services" activity designates the same range of activities later itemized (in FY17 and FY18) into 23 separate functional activities.  Realignment into, and addition of, activities in FY17 and FY18 provides a more logical functional segmentation of installation management programs and aligns programs into more discrete/recognizable bins.  This breakout facilitates improved programming visibility, articulation, justification, and definition of the unique scope of Army Kwajalein Atoll Installation Services.  Activities included in the FY16 "Municipal Services" activity include: Base Operations Support, Logistical Support, Medical/Dental Support, Army Family Housing (AFH) Operations, Army Airfields (AAF) and Heliports (AHP), Army Community Services (ACS), Child and Youth Services (CYS), Engineering Services, Soldier Recreation and Community Support, Fire and Emergency Services (FES), Financial Management (FM) Activities, Food Services, Unaccompanied Housing, Materiel Maintenance, Installation Command and Management, Physical Security Matters, Army Security Programs, Supply Logistics, Transportation Services, Utilities, Environmental Quality, and Anti-Terrorism (AT).  For FY18, "Municipal Services" designates resources for municipal services including grounds maintenance, custodial, pest management, solid waste or refuse handling operations, pavement clearance through the removal of snow/ice/sand and street sweeping, and homeless shelter support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

For FY18, "Municipal Services" designates resources for municipal services including grounds maintenance, custodial, pest management, solid waste or refuse handling operations, pavement clearance through the removal of snow/ice/sand and street sweeping, and homeless shelter support.

Realignment into, and addition of, activities in FY17 and FY18 provides a more logical functional segmentation of installation management programs and aligns programs into more discrete/recognizable bins.  This breakout facilitates improved programming visibility, articulation, justification, and definition of critical requirements.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds the restoration and modernization of United States (U.S.) Army Kwajalein Atoll degraded infrastructure (real property/facilities) to working condition and upgrades facilities to meet current standards. Restoration consists of repair and replacement work to fix facilities degraded due to the effects of aging and  inadequate sustainment funding for a number of years. Modernization supports upgrade of facilities to meet current codes, accommodate new functions, and/or replace building components that exceed the overall service life of the facilities. The proposed funding levels support a small fraction of critical infrastructure restoration and modernization work necessary to current and enduring deficiencies based analysis of infrastructure identified.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Concepts Experimentation Program Element (PE) supports current and future concepts and capabilities involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and constructive environments by exploring concepts, capability requirements and solution across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains in order to learn and mitigate risk for current and future forces.  Experiments and projects inform the Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.

Enables TRADOC Capability Development and Integration Directorates (CDID)/TRADOC Capability Managers (TCM) Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development to support Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions.  The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA(ALT) organizational community of PEOs/PMs supplemented manpower shortfalls to TRADOC for many years. This was necessary to ensure work affecting their materiel development programs, specifically the mandated JCIDS process necessary for Milestone acquisition Army Requirements Oversight Council/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (AROC/JROC) decisions, was executed in a timely manner.  Funding ensures TRADOC acts independently as the voice of the warfighter, the user, in complement with the materiel developer in providing total capability management including integration of all DOTMLPF consideration for warfighting functional areas.  Provides for TRADOC to serve as the lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs enabling development and deployment/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force.  Early Synthetic Prototyping enables wargaming, experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions.  Enables TRADOC to serve as the central coordinating organization for Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) staff support requirements related to accelerated capabilities developments and integrate accelerated capabilities development activities between proponent force modernization domains to include Joint/Service coordination.  Provides Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA), which will allow TRADOC to physically integrate, assess and evaluate the network, capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. Provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) that are used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.

The Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. Design analyses, constructive simulations and Soldier-in-the loop assessments will ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered to avoid information and physical task overloads, and take optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, this Program Element (PE) funds labor for physical security civilian guards and equipment as well as the UH-60 helicopters. Beginning in FY18, this PE will fund the Network Enterprise Center (NEC), Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP), and airfield operations, which were previous funded by the Operations and Maintenance - Army (OMA) appropriation.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides the institutional funding required to operate test activities, in accordance with Section 232 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), in support of Department of Defense (DoD) Program Executive Officers, Program and Product Managers, and Research, Development, and Engineering Centers. Resources provided by this project operate six elements of the DoD Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB): White Sands Test Center (WSTC),White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Centers (TRTC) at various locations. This PE also funds the Army's test capability at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.

This PE finances the overhead (institutional) test operating costs not billable to DoD test customers per Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3200.18 and Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DODFMR) 7000.14-R, which include recurring test infrastructure/capability sustainment requirements, replacement of test equipment, test operating procedures, and test revitalization/upgrade projects to maintain current testing capabilities and improvements to safety, environmental protection, efficiency of test operations, and technological advances. The test capabilities at these ranges have been uniquely established, are in place to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements of funded weapons programs, and are required to assure technical performance, adherence to safety requirements, reliability, logistics supportability, Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation, transportability, environmental effects, electromagnetic effects, and quality of materiel in development and in production.

This PE sustains the T&amp;E capability required to support Army as well as Joint Service or Other Service systems, materiel, and technologies. Types of systems scheduled for testing include: Aircraft, Air Delivery, Unmanned Aerial Systems, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, Air and Missile Defense Systems, Engineering Equipment, Direct fire, Indirect fire, Nonlethal weapons, Ammunition, Automotive Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Ground Soldier System, Missiles, Rockets, Mission Command Network, and Tactical Command, Control, and Communication.

At the Redstone Test Center (RTC), amplifiers used in testing electromagnetic environmental effects (E3) of Army aviation and missile programs were refurbished to provide the necessary reliability for a system that is utilized extensively.  This refurbishment replaced obsolete equipment that has been in use for the past 40 years to extend the life of the amplifiers.  The Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) continued their development of a complete test capability to support high volume, high-speed production/acceptance test capability for body armor and vehicle armor plates.  The ATC also continued the improvement and development of methodology for capturing crew survivability data during live fire and fire suppression testing for combat vehicle programs.  Instrumentation, transducers, and other sensing technologies are being developed to measure parameters which my result in crew injuries.  At the Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), instrumentation was developed to increase the capability to test C4ISR tactical networks in support of developmental testing.  The new equipment ensures compliance with customer requirements for speed, capacity, and reliability.  At the White Sands Test Center (WSTC), provided funding to replace obsolete components for existing FPS-16 Monopulse Tracking Radar systems supporting missile defense programs.  The WSTC also acquired the excessed Multiple Object Tracking Radar – 4 (MOTR-4) from Vandenberg Air Force Base to replace two degraded FPS-16s.  At the Yuma Test Center (YTC), a usability life extension effort for the Close-In radar systems (Continuous Wave Doppler/Pulse Systems) was begun to mitigate obsolescence and a lack of available components from industry.  This effort will result in extended operational capabilities that are supported by the manufacturer with enhancements to support smart munitions.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) plans, conducts and reports on operational tests, assessments and experiments in order to provide essential information for the acquisition and fielding of War Fighting Systems. Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from systems under test and the systems which they integrate with to  support effectiveness, survivability, and suitability analysis; these systems also provide real-time position location and status tracking to support test control. The Army's Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making enhancement of live forces through simulation essential for testing in a realistic, operational environment by simulating tactical engagements, additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. ATEC OT Modeling, Simulation and Instrumentation (MS&amp;I) funding is used to adapt capabilities from other organizations (including within ATEC), purchase off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems. As required, the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development and integration of major simulation and instrumentation systems. The MS&amp;I (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds analytical products necessary for inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center's (ATEC/AEC) mission. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions. Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), the products funded by this PE are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.This PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization. Products concern Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command and communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role. Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests. These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.

Survivability analyses funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cybersecurity and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons. This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces. Survivability data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's Army Regulation (AR) 5-5 studies process. Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability. Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this PE to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the Headquarters’ Department of the Army (HQDA) Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (G1) Human Systems Integration (HSI) program. United States (U.S.) Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this PE to initiate and improve survivability/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics. Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the PE are leveraged as core inputs to formal Army regulation (AR) 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations. Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this PE are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program/production decisions.   
 
This PE also supports cybersecurity survivability analysis of Army battle command/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology. Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems. In conjunction with PMs and Army intelligence agencies, this PE also analyzes technical vulnerabilities of foreign weapons, network related systems, and intelligence Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to U.S. Army EW systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification Program Element (PE) ensures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. This PE provides independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62, and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This PE performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems. This PE also provides management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO AVN) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO), the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office, in developing requirements for major development/modification and for any future systems/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process. The Airworthiness Certification PE also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models. Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification include: PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS. Additionally, the Airworthiness Certification PE supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker). Project 092 also provides: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides meteorological support to research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) activities and provides standard and specialized weather forecasts and data to satisfy Army/Department of Defense (DoD) RDT&amp;E test requirements for modern weaponry, e.g., (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target to background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go/ no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety. The PE provides technical weather support to Army and Joint Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This PE develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army/DoD RDTE requirements. It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems. Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel/weapons developers and project/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999. This PE enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the United States (US) Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army.  AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of Army weapon/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies system level performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&amp;S).  

AMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating, and accrediting item-level performance data and M&amp;S for combat effects and logistics.  This includes the development and maintenance of common data formats.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance trade-offs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses; cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by leadership within HQDA (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); Army Materiel Command; Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD).  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier, along with enhancing readiness for the Current and Future Force. 

AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for the readiness of the Current and Future Force.  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and life cycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprints and life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical PoF program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.  AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations, resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operating and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprints.  AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), has formed the Center for Reliability Growth (CRG), which develops critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs to achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process.  The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems will translate into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings over the life cycle.

AMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting AEC to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing.  AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and results in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter.  AMSAA assists in systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions, and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.

As the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel.  AMSAA's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Current Operations and the development of the Future Force (Long-Range Investment Requirements Analysis (LIRA), Force 2025 and beyond).  AMSAA's integrated set of skills and tools are focused on its core mission to be responsive to the breadth and depth of systems analysis requirements critical in supporting Army decisions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds Department of the Army (DA) civilians at the United States (US) Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis in support of senior Army decision making for equipping the U.S. Army.  AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology; materiel acquisition; and the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of Army weapon/materiel systems.  As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies system level performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&amp;S).  

AMSAA exercises Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating, and accrediting item-level performance data and M&amp;S for combat effects and logistics.  This includes the development and maintenance of common data formats.  In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems.  Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, and system reliability.  AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies.  AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as:  Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); system cost/performance trade-offs and early technology trade-offs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses; cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; and analytical support for Test and Evaluation.  AMSAA also maintains, pursuant to Army Acquisition Executive direction, the Center for Army Acquisition and Materiel Lessons Learned (CAAMLL).  These analyses are used by leadership within HQDA (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat); Army Materiel Command; Army Research, Development and Engineering Command; Training and Doctrine Command; Army Test and Evaluation Command; Program Executive Officers/Project Managers; and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD).  AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier, along with enhancing readiness for the Current and Future Force. 

AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment.  AMSAA maintains a significant number of models and simulations, most of which were developed in-house to address specific analytical requirements.  This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling process that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for the readiness of the Current and Future Force.  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development.  In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements reliability and maintainability reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and life cycle management.  AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and also provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprints and life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment.  AMSAA's electronic and mechanical PoF program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process.

The primary aim of the Project is to maximize the efficiency of research and development for force and materiel development by reducing the uncertainties associated with these threats.  The Project also answers scientific and technical intelligence requirements, provides materiel for realistic testing and training, and aids in the development of countermeasures to threat systems, materiel, and technologies.  Operations have increased the amount of captured threat materiel that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for US forces.  Acquisition and exploitation are executed according to Army FMP Plan prioritization and with the approval of the G2.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, Army Joint Test Element (JTE) was realigned from Program Element (PE) 0605898A (Management HQ - R&amp;D) / Project M65 (Army Test and Evaluation Command) to PE 0605712A (Support of Operational Testing) / Project 001 (ATEC Joint Tests And Follow-On Test and Eval).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides resources to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to operate the Army Joint Test Element (JTE) and the Army's Operational Test Command (OTC). JTE examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies' mission gaps, tactics and doctrine, resulting in the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and assessment documents. Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding for the Army JTE which examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies' mission gaps, tactics and doctrine, resulting in the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs) and Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to the Army test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) as the joint OTA.  Mission support for JTE includes supporting two Joint Tests under the Joint Test program, and assigned special projects.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  JTE supports Joint Tests until these Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to operate the Operational Test Command (OTC) which conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to the Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts.  This program element finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  

OTC consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas.  These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives.  The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE).  OTC conducts operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to the Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program Element (PE) 0605718A promotes the Army's Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) strategy, defined by five guiding priorities: (1) formulate Army M&amp;S policies; (2) develop and employ management processes for models, simulations and data; (3) develop M&amp;S standards, architectures, networks and environments; (4) develop/employ new M&amp;S tools and simulation technology; (5) develop an M&amp;S workforce.  PE 0605718A focuses on priorities 3 and 4.

M&amp;S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability.  The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information.  The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&amp;S and data reuse.  The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.

M&amp;S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&amp;S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities.  M&amp;S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making.  The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&amp;S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools.  To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&amp;S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&amp;S tools readily accessible.  PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making.  Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project has two functions:

Function 1 (priority 3 of the "Army Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Strategy") -- Develop M&amp;S standards, architectures, networks and environments that promote sharing, interoperability, access, and reliable application of tools, formats, data and information among/for users.

Function 2 (priority 4 of the "Army M&amp;S Strategy") -- Develop and improve tools and technology in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making.  These tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose.  

Resources under Project S03 support the six M&amp;S communities (Acquisition, Analysis, Experimentation, Intelligence, Test &amp; Evaluation, Training) at the enterprise level through enabling efforts. These efforts include the following: (a) design models, simulations, data and tools that are resident within one organization but reusable and trusted by M&amp;S users and specialists across the Army M&amp;S enterprise; (b) leverage industry and academia; (c) promote interoperability within M&amp;S and between M&amp;S and operational capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Science Board (ASB) is a federal advisory committee, organized under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Government in the Sunshine Act, which provides the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of Defense with independent and transparent advice and recommendations on matters relating to scientific, technical, manufacturing, acquisition, logistics, and business management functions.  The ASB dates to November 1951 when the Secretary of the Army, Honorable Frank Pace Jr., appointed twelve outstanding scientists and industrialists to a scientific advisory panel to assist him and the Army’s leadership in creating an effective, economical, and progressive fighting force using existing technology and industrial resources.  Three years later, this panel was expanded and officially designated the Army Scientific Advisory Panel (ASAP), with its first formal meeting held on November 16, 1954.  In 1977, with the passage of FACA, the ASB was created to replace the ASAP.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) is the only Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory that conducts research to enhance the Soldier lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion).  This project supports the non-Army Management Headquarters Activity (non-AMHA) management and administrative functions to enable ARI to accomplish its research mission and includes activities such as budget execution, procurement oversight, Research, Development, test, and Evaluation (RDTE) program planning and evaluation, management control, security/safety, logistics, information technology, and personnel/manpower execution and oversight. ARI's behavioral and social science research provides effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&amp;D) community. Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&amp;T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (Projects 720 and 727). This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (Project 729). The program includes funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues to provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (Project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (Project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (Project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (Project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (Project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Title>Administrative Support for the Army's SBIR and STTR Programs</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Army SBIR and Army STTR programs. In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of US based small businesses in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&amp;D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&amp;D solutions in response to critical Army needs.  The STTR program expands the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions.  The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century.  The SBIR/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level.  The Army SBIR/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports continuing technology investigations.  It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  

Project 297 - Munitions Survivability &amp; Logistics: This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.

Project 857 - DoD Explosives Safety Standards : This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board.  It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards.  Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion-resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard/protection criteria.

Project 858 - Army Explosives Safety Management Program: This Project establishes, validates or modifies explosives technical safety requirements per Department of Defense Manual 6055.09 and Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Project activities promote Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) of new and innovative explosives safety technologies that improve the survivability of Army personnel, facilities, and equipment as well as improve the health, safety and welfare of the general public (with highest priority directed to combat theater of operations).

Project 859 - Life Cycle Pilot Process: This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments.  It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products.  Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.

Project F21:  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding assures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance.  The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.  This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production United States (U.S.) weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations.  FY 2018 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance.

F24 - Conventional Munitions Demilitarization (Demil): The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization technology Project supports the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) responsibility per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5160.68 to plan, program, budget and fund a Joint Service Research and Development (R&amp;D) program that develops capability and capacity as well as technology and facilities to support the SMCA mission to demil and dispose of conventional ammunition stored in the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A).  The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demil capabilities and processes.  Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&amp;D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&amp;D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Laboratory quantity testing:  Explosives safety criteria are generally geared towards larger quantities of explosives where the specifics of the donor structure have less of an effect on the hazards generated.  This is particularly problematic for lab quantities of explosives (e.g., 500 grams and lower), where the specifics of the construction type, room geometry, standoff, etc., can have a profound effect on the associated hazards.  Current criteria is admittedly conservative in this regime, but testing and analysis are needed to justify reduced safety standoff distances.  This work will leverage previous ATF lab quantities testing by increasing the explosive weight until breach of a sheetrock wall; determine the secondary breach debris hazards from a nominal laboratory room design; and assess overpressurization failure hazards of a nominal laboratory room design.   This will result in reduced safety standoff distances for the conditions tested.  

Hazard Division 1.3 testing:  As a result of a study of historical accidents approximately 75% of accidents are initiated by fire versus by detonation via an initiation chain.  Also, the Insensitive Munitions Program has as a primary goal to develop more “insensitive” munitions and their end state is systems that react by burn only.  These two conditions combine to make the potential for a non-detonation reaction more likely in the event of an explosives accident.  This testing effort is designed to address the gaps in knowledge of HD 1.3/thermal hazards from a non-detonation reaction by performing testing to characterize the debris hazards from breakup of a confining structure, characterize the directional jetting effects from such structures, and assess the thermal hazard of burning in the open.</r2:Text>

These standards are captured in several DoD issuances, but the primary one is DoDM 6055.09, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.  Changes to DoDM 6055.09 must be approved by the DoD Explosives Safety Board.  The Board Members have identified their priorities for update of DoDM 6055.09, and these priorities are reflected in the formation of DDESB working groups and test programs to develop new and revised explosives safety standards.  This effort continually improves safety policy and guidance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments.  It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products.  Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP).  LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC).  In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements.  This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production United States (U.S.) weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU).  Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to maintain critical mass domestic production and affordable taxpayer costs through increased economies of scale.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 funding supports NATO small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation and test operations.  FY 2018 funding also supports JBMOU ballistic testing including firing tables, safety, reliability, and performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) resources environmental quality technology (EQT) related management support functions including support of research, development, test and evaluation required for EQT technical integration efforts at demonstration/validation test sites, technical information and activities, test facilities and general test instrumentation, and EQT requirement assessments.  Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this PE.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Program.

The Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  

The Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction and Airborne Lead Reduction environmental quality technology programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Planned Program Army Joint Test Element (JTE) moved from Project M65 to Program Element (PE) 0605712 / Project 001 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for the authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the United States (US) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, assessments and experiments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. 

This Program Element includes staff/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~ 2,700 developmental tests; approximately ~70 operational events; and more than ~700 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs.  ATEC’s FY15 total authorized workforce is 8,282 with a $1.8 billion program.

The Army JTE examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The Department of Army (DA) G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DoD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two JTUs under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM.

This project does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation or test equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for the authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the United States (US)  Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, assessments and experiments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. 

This Project includes staff/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range:  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WSTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC), at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~ 2,700 developmental tests; approximately ~70 operational events; and more than ~700 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs. ATEC’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 total authorized workforce is 8,282 with a $1.8 billion program.

The Army Joint Test Element (JTE) examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies mission gaps, tactics and doctrine resulting in the development of Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and assessment documents.  Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs), Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies (JFSs) and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to ATEC as the joint OTA.  The ATEC Commanding General serves as the Executive Steering Committee (ESG) member, while the Executive Director serves as the Technical Advisory Board (TAB) member.  Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5010.41 provides policies and responsibilities for the JTE.  The Department of Army (DA) G-8 is the agent for JTE for operations and DoD level Senior Advisory Council (SAC) responsibly.  Mission support also includes the support to two Joint Test Units (JTU) under the re-engineered Joint Test program.  ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, and Suffolk VA with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support.  Additional support to Joint Tests remains a requirement until the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, this Program Element (PE) realigns operational and mission support funding from PE 0605301A (Army Kwajalein Atoll) / Project DX2 (Army Kwajalein Test Ranges and Mission Support). Installation management functions for the Reagan Test Site remain in Project DX2.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Space and Missile Defense Command-Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC-ARSTRAT) funding is for management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). RTS began its funding under Program Element (PE)0605301A, Project DX2 in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. Beginning in FY 2018, operational and mission support functions at RTS are realigned to PE 0606002A. RTS is a tenant on the United States (US) Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), located within the Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking &amp; identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs.  Programs supported include Army Missile Defense, Air Force, and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational/demonstration/validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), ionospheric studies, space debris tracking, and data collection in support of space experiments.  RTS is a government-managed/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). Program funds contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. Program funds contractors to accomplish O&amp;M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system. The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at RTS, are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world providing critical intelligence data.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and AEGIS weapon systems), and NASA's space experiments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

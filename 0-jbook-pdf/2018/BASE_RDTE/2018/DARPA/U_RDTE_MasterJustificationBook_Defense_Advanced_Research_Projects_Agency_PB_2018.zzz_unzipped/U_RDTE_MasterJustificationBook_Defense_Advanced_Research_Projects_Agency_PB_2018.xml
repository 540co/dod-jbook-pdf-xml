                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.

     The Bio/Info/Micro Sciences project investigated and developed the intersections of biology, information technology and micro/physical systems to exploit important technological advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques, and systems of interest to the DoD. This research is critical to the development of improved training and cognitive rehabilitation. Programs in this project drew upon the information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. This project developed the basic research tools in biology that are unique to the application of biological-based solutions to critical Defense problems.

     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements. The project is exploring novel means of leveraging computer capabilities, including: practical, logical, heuristic, and automated reasoning by machines; enhanced human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; innovative approaches to the composition of software; innovative computer architectures; mathematical programs and their potential for defense applications; and new learning mechanisms for systematically upgrading and improving these capabilities. Promising techniques will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.

      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, and mission-critical information systems at risk. The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats. Promising research results will be transitioned to both technology development and system-level projects.

     The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. The Beyond Scaling programs in this project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. 

     The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.

     The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in computing and the computing-reliant subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This research is critical to the development of improved training and cognitive rehabilitation.  Programs in this project drew upon the information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project developed the basic research tools in biology that are unique to the application of biological-based solutions to critical Defense problems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Quantitative Models of the Brain program established a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  An important focus of this program was determining how information is stored and recalled in the brain and other DoD-relevant signals, developing predictive, quantitative models of learning, memory, and measurement.  Using this understanding, the program developed powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that has provided the ability to understand complex and evolving signals and tasks while decreasing software and hardware requirements and other measurement resources.  This included a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels that would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation have enabled these advances.  This program further exploited advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to improve training of individuals as well as identify new therapies for cognitive rehabilitation (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)).  Critical to success was the ability to detect cellular and network-level changes produced in the brain during the formation of new, hierarchically organized memories and memory classes, and to correlate those changes with memory function of animals during performance of behavioral tasks.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The current manual adaptation process is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation.  BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. One focus area of the Social Systems thrust is to develop and validate new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems. Another focus area is to identify methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale. This thrust is an aggregation of programs previously contained in Knowledge Representation.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing the state-of-the-art in human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context.  Human language is inherently ambiguous and so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and context to make language comprehensible.  CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure and link language to this perceptual encoding.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics and the psychology of visual encoding which are essential for human communication in the physical world.  CWC will also work to extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts such as virtual constructs in the cyber domain.  CWC advances will impact military application areas such as robotics and command and control.</r2:Description>

One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets.  Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.  Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available.  Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Big Mechanism program is creating new approaches to automated computational intelligence applicable to diverse domains such as biology, cyber, economics, social science, and intelligence.  Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract yet predictive, ideally causal, models from massive volumes of diverse data generated by human actors, physical sensors and networked devices.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models is growing exponentially and has now, or will soon, exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism will create technologies to extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases readily adapted to novel problem scenarios; powerful reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations, apply general rules to specific instances, and generate (and compute the likelihood of) the most plausible explanations for a sequence of events; and knowledge synthesis techniques to derive abstract principles and/or create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications will accommodate an operator-in-the-loop by accepting questions posed in human natural language, providing drill-down to reveal the basis for an answer, taking user inputs to improve/correct derived associations, weightings and conclusions, and querying the operator to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  Big Mechanism techniques will integrate burgeoning data into causal models and explore these models for precise interventions.  The program has adopted cancer modeling as an initial focus because the availability of experimental data and the complexity of the problems are representative of challenges facing the DoD in areas such as cyber attribution and open-source intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program will develop data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics, automobiles, and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and polymer chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. The SD2 program will develop tools to enable robust design despite the lack of complete scientific models. This will involve collecting raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub; developing computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data; and creating data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.  The program will adopt synthetic biology as the primary application domain.  Alternative domains of interest include chemistry, material science, and neuro-computation.  SD2 builds on techniques being developed under the Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning program.</r2:Description>

The World Modelers program will develop the capability to model regional and global systems to generate timely indications and warnings with techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using primary literature (e.g., news and analyst reports, journal articles) as a structuring mechanism and government and commercial data (e.g., remote sensing imagery, commodities futures prices) as quantitative inputs.  Advances in machine reading and learning, semantic technologies, big data analysis, geo-spatial and economic modeling, and environmental simulation bring this strategic capability within reach.</r2:Description>

Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities could impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data, particularly in real world environments where unpredictable events may occur.</r2:Description>

The key enabling technology is a radically new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that enables developers to quickly build generative models of phenomena and queries of interest which a compiler would convert into efficient applications.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, and medical diagnostics.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Unconventional Processing of Signals for Intelligent Data Exploitation (UPSIDE) program created a new generation of computing structures, enabling revolutionary advances in real-time sensor data analysis.  To demonstrate the impact of this advance, the program improved the performance and power efficiency of detecting and tracking objects in video streams.  Today, computer-based object detection and tracking requires matching an object of interest to its high-precision digital representation, which is an inherently power-hungry process.  UPSIDE instead employed an approach known as approximate computing which operates very efficiently on both semiconductor-based electronic devices and emerging alternative devices without sacrificing accuracy.  UPSIDE demonstrated five to seven orders of magnitude improvement in the power efficiency and performance of real-time sensor data analysis.  The UPSIDE computing approach was benchmarked against a DoD-relevant image processing pipeline to verify gains in both throughput and power efficiency.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program is developing techniques to detect algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities and side channel attacks in software.  Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so now cyber adversaries must find new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws.  The STAC program seeks to develop analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these attacks in the software upon which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The SafeWare program is developing new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering.  At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms.  Today's state of the art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.), which is not resilient against automated tools.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970's.  In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical.  The SafeWare program will take this very early-stage obfuscation theory and re-tool its mathematical foundations to move it towards becoming practical and efficient.</r2:Description>

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.

Within this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance light detection and ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact radio frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and radar systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  HAVOC will fund basic research in vacuum electronics to improve understanding of the various phenomena governing vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz.  Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to identify, investigate, and demonstrate inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.

The Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) program will investigate advanced analog components to process radio frequency (RF) signals for communications, radar, and electronic warfare applications.  Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others.  The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation.  By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency.  This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full-duplex radio communication.  Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare.</r2:Description>

The Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW).  Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry.  This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications.  For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is driven by the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels.</r2:Description>

Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.

The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.

Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components. As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization. This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems. Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware. Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will investigate the innovative technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  To enable this possibility, N-ZERO's basic research component will consider highly innovative sensors and sensor architectures as well as signal processing and digitization technologies with near-zero power consumption.  In particular, the program will explore and develop a fundamental understanding of the trade space between power consumption, the minimum detectable signal, and the probability of falsely detecting a trigger.  An applied research component is budgeted under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale and adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Living Foundries will develop tools to simplify, abstract, and standardize the biological production pathway optimization process.  Additionally, Living Foundries will identify the fundamental design rules that govern the construction and organization of underlying genetic elements in the production pathways.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation, and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality.  Applied research for this program is budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

The Social Simulation (SocialSim) program will develop a computational capability to simulate the spread and evolution of information in the online environment.  The global information environment is radically changing how and at what rate information spreads and evolves, and both nation-state and sub-state actors are incorporating messaging in their operations to great advantage.  Existing approaches to understanding online information spread and evolution are largely based on specialized exercises that take considerable time to orchestrate and execute and have limited accuracy.  A corresponding computational simulation has the potential to enable a deeper and more quantitative understanding of adversaries' messaging campaigns and their likely outcomes, as well as exploration of potential responses.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Engineering Complex Systems will pursue new approaches to engineer complex, multi-cellular systems for enhanced capabilities and function.  Complex biological materials and systems have unique properties (e.g., controlled porosity and high strength-to-weight ratios) not only because of the inherent components but also because of how those components are assembled together across length scales.  Engineering biology tools and techniques are now at a stage to pursue the organization and function of multi-cellular systems for a new class of improved capabilities.  This program will develop underlying technological platforms to enable information driven assembly of hierarchical multi-cellular systems for the development of advanced materials.</r2:Description>

Traditional research in this field has been limited to microbial systems and focused on imparting capabilities from one biological system to another. Instead, this work will investigate methods to biologically encode new functionalities in cell-free, multicellular, and/or multi-organism systems, using innovations from related areas of microbiology as well as micro- and nanotechnology.

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring and preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling, and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; developing techniques to enable rapid transient immunity for emerging pathogens; and identifying fundamental biological mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research efforts in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases.  Today, protective measures such as antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance.  New approaches, such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen, are needed in vaccine and antiviral design.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants.  Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program will develop the underlying technologies to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing capabilities which are currently available only in centralized laboratories in the U.S. to non-tertiary care and individual settings.  ADEPT will develop and exploit biological tools for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.  Applied research efforts are budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Harnessing Biological Systems program will explore fundamental approaches to applying the advantages of nature's building blocks and principles in the design of biological technologies and systems.  Rather than creating biomimetic designs that imitate naturally evolved capabilities this program seeks to transition to a biocentric design approach, developing tools and understanding mechanisms to leverage evolutionary advances from the start.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying approaches to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  One example will be to identify the underlying mechanisms by which predatory bacteria prey upon and consume other antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antibacterial therapies that rely on small molecule antibiotics.  Advances in this area may be applied to a range of biological technologies including the autonomous control of epidemics.</r2:Description>

Successful battlefield medical technologies and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges.  Example battlefield medical technologies include continued understanding of infection biomarkers to lead to the development of detection devices that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Complementary battlefield technologies will be implemented in a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak or rapidly developing a medical countermeasure to outpace a disease outbreak, as well as the capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater.  New neural architectures and data processing algorithms will be developed to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Critical to success will be the ability to detect and quantify functional and/or structural changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks.  This program will also develop neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population.  The ultimate goal is identification of efficacious therapeutics approaches that can bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program will explore and develop advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity.  One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program will specifically examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this thrust include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor &amp; sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.</r2:Description>

Device technology has advanced to the point where human beings can be instrumented with and connected to a broad range of unobtrusive, always-on physiological, cognitive, and contextual sensors and information systems.  At the same time, body-area networks, wearable displays, haptics, and other novel forms of human-computer interfaces have advanced enough that convenient real-time multifactor analysis for neurofeedback and biofeedback are within reach.  The Performance Optimization in Complex Environments program will first focus on developing prototyping and manufacturing techniques necessary to integrate these two advancing areas to enable optimal performance in a wide variety of activities from learning and training to specialized tasking, and to mitigate the effects of physical injury, age, and mental impairment.  Research will also focus on understanding various forms of sensing and actuation to improve outcomes and how biofeedback over time can alter human capability.  Technologies developed through this program will provide a foundation of novel value propositions to the warfighter in terms of restoration of lost capability, situational awareness, resilience, cognitive and physical effectiveness, and force multiplication.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The overarching goal of the Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease program is to leverage advanced data collection methods and prognostic capabilities to predict changes in health and spread of infectious disease from the individual to the population scale.  While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need.  Research in this thrust will investigate new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure.  Additionally, this thrust will develop new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread.  Technologies developed in this program will enable clinically actionable information, even when an individual has no awareness of symptoms, and extend infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support.</r2:Description>

ADEPT will focus on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT will also focus on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.  A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01.</r2:Description>

Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method, other than surgical intervention, can effectively treat intracavity bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of hemostasis and wound control for non-compressible hemorrhage in the abdominal space, regardless of wound geometry or location within that space.  This thrust is also investigating non-invasive techniques and equipment to use laser energy to treat intracranial hemorrhage through the skull and tissues in a pre-surgical environment.  Finally, in order to address logistical delays associated with delivering necessary therapeutics to the battlefield, this thrust will also develop a pharmacy on demand that will provide a rapid response capability to enable far-forward medical providers the ability to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers.  The goal of this program was to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales.  Significant advances were made in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process.  The developed device could save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.  Additionally, the device may be effective as a medical countermeasure against various chemical and biological (chem-bio) threat agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins. Applied research under this program applied existing component technologies and integrated these products to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort was development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.</r2:Description>

The Warrior Web program mitigated that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system is compliant and transparent to the user, it can reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.  Success in this program required the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution/energy storage.  The final system weighed no more than 9kg and required no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform missions with reduced risk of injuries can have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance, and the long-term health of our veterans.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.

     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the core computing and networking technologies required to protect DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  The technologies will provide cost-effective security and survivability solutions that enable DoD information systems to operate correctly and continuously even under attack.  

   The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; to respond  intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as partners to human operators. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to operate safely with high degrees of autonomy. 

     The Cyber Technology project developed technology to increase the security of military information systems and the effectiveness of cyber operations.  Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare by integrating people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project ensured DoD net-centric capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks and enabled new cyber-warfighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for rapidly integrating information from a variety of sources, increasing battlefield situational awareness.  To develop operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today watch live battlefield feeds to detect items of interest, fusing together and interpreting information from multiple sensors and sources.  The amount of information gathered, however, is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlefield in real time.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Electronic Globalization effort aims to develop advanced capabilities for validating the function of digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) given limited design specifications.  These ICs are critical to nearly all military systems.  Globalization and rapid growth in the commercial electronics industry have limited DoD's ability to influence and regulate IC fabrication.  DoD today accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall IC market and the vast majority of IC manufacturing capacity lies overseas.  As a result, parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet the stated specifications for performance and reliability.  Electronic Globalization will pursue the technologies required to address this and other risks to DoD IC's, such as reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property.  The effort will support the development of key risk-reduction techniques including advanced imaging and computational methods for identifying an IC's functional elements.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>* Formerly Spectrum Grand Challenge

The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program seeks to catalyze the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each others' operating characteristics.  SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum.</r2:Description>

Currently, the capabilities of these systems are fixed at the time of design and limited by their designer's vision.  Conversely, a generic RFMLS system would learn how to reconfigure its circuits and processing to meet the requirements of a desired application in a specific environment.  The relevant RF features are hand crafted and human specified today, and would instead be learned through machine learning algorithms applied within the RF system itself.  The RFMLS system would later learn to adapt to changing conditions and requirements, making for a much more robust RF system solution.  This flexibility should reduce the time and cost of continually re-designing and upgrading new systems and extend RF system performance beyond the limits of human designers.  RMFLS exploits recent advancements in machine learning that have not previously been applied to RF systems.</r2:Description>

The Cortical Processor program aims to develop algorithms and hardware that can better handle the increasingly large and diverse sensor data streams used by battlefield systems.  By leveraging advances in machine learning, the program could yield systems with the flexibility to understand and adapt to new contexts and new types of sensed data (e.g. new radio frequency or infrared signals).  Current sensor platforms, conversely, are pre-programmed only to interpret specific data types and require a laborious coding effort to accommodate new types of data or contexts.  Cortical Processor will develop hardware implementations that gracefully handle multiple data streams and limit the programming burden required for sensing and interpreting a complex scenario.  The program will further be enabled by bio-inspired algorithms that benefit from research into biological learning and data processing.  Cortical Processor's applied research component will investigate silicon circuit designs that are most suitable for high-performance, low-power, real-time sensing and data processing.</r2:Description>

Current embedded ISR applications rely on commercial processors designed for large data centers and therefore struggle to perform within the power and space limitations of platforms such as unmanned vehicles.  As a result, these platforms often need to wirelessly access remote processing resources, potentially denying warfighters access to critical real-time information.  Access to remote processing resources can also become unavailable in contested environments.  To resolve this issue, PERFECT developed design tools and techniques to enable ISR sensor systems to process information locally, onboard the platform.  These techniques should allow for processing data at lower voltages, speeding up data processing with specialized accelerators, and ensuring system reliability.</r2:Description>

The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems.  RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing.  RADICS technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. government elements responsible for defense of critical infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) program is developing new computer networking architectures that deter, detect, and overcome distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks include not only high-volume flooding attacks of hundreds of gigabits per second, but more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while causing exhaustion of server processor and memory capacity.  These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.  XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Brandeis program is creating the capability to dynamically, flexibly, and securely share information while ensuring that private data may be used only for its intended purpose and no other.  Brandeis will break the tension between maintaining privacy and being able to tap into the huge value of data.  In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that enable the sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  Brandeis technologies are being designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.</r2:Description>

The proliferation of processing cores in multi-core central processing units provides the opportunity to adapt fault-tolerant architectures proven in aerospace applications to mission-critical, embedded, and real-time computing systems.  The CFAR program will combine techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that exhibit differences in behavior under attack, so that CFAR-enabled computing systems will quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services.  CFAR technologies will be developed in coordination with operational users.</r2:Description>

The program is creating algorithms and software prototypes for use exclusively at the network edge, specifically on end hosts and/or on proxy servers fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems will sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication.  This will enable highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dispersed Computing (DC) program will address research challenges encountered in the Edge-Directed Cyber Technologies for Reliable Mission Communication (EdgeCT) program by developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources.  At present, enterprises and Internet-based IT service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The DC program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler for DC is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  Under DC, these dual-purposed network-compute elements will be used to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data (and vice versa) given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With DC technology, the network becomes the cloud (and vice versa), and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so.</r2:Description>

Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness.  An alternative solution, maintaining complete control of the global supply chain using administrative controls, can also incur substantial costs.  SHIELD instead seeks to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip ("dielet") into the packaging of genuine components.  The dielet would provide unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity.  Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD would fulfill a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies.</r2:Description>

Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program aims to enable the systematic design of networked cyber physical systems to be resilient against cyberattacks.  The current state-of-practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach is to formulate cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.  If successful, CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries.  CASE builds on technology developed in the High Assurance Cyber Military Systems program.</r2:Description>

The ACOD capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  As with algorithmic trading of financial instruments, the program envisions high-intensity cyber operations conducted by computers under human supervision.  To accomplish this, ACOD will combine automated cyber defense capabilities, such as those developed in DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge, with human-centric cyber operations planning and execution capabilities, such as those developed under DARPA's Plan X program.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber-Hunting at Scale (CHASE) program will develop data-driven tools for real-time cyber threat detection, characterization, and protection within enterprise-scale networks.  U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks. The nature of the threat should be used to determine which data and analyses are required. For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from millions of devices. CHASE is will develop novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and disseminate protective measures that automatically bolster the collective cyber defense posture.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program is developing and demonstrating technologies to secure mission-critical embedded computing systems.  The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications.  Additionally, the program will explore the use of formal methods to bring high levels of inherent assurance to Internet-enabled applications, in particular, applications involving remote update, access, management, authorization, and control.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) program is creating automated defenses that can identify and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  Initial funding for this effort was provided in Project IT-05.  Additional funding is being provided in IT-03 to enable the creation of the more robust competition infrastructure necessary to accommodate the large number of competitors.</r2:Description>

Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower but can learn to recognize novel pathogens.  Similarly, CRASH developed mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminated known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH also developed software techniques that allowed a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH developed techniques to make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.</r2:Description>

Vulnerabilities found in current standalone and networked systems can be amplified in cloud computing environments.  MRC addressed this risk by creating advanced network protocols and new approaches to computing in potentially compromised distributed environments.  Attention focused on adapting defenses and allocating resources dynamically in response to attacks and compromises.  MRC resulted in new approaches to measure trust, reach consensus in compromised environments, and allocate resources in response to current threats and computational requirements.  MRC developed new verification and control techniques for networks embedded in clouds that must function reliably in complex adversarial environments.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Language Understanding and Symbiotic Automation project develops technologies to enable computing systems to understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events; and to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as partners to human operators.  Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act.  Incorporating these technologies in military systems will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems to operate safely with high degrees of autonomy.  The technologies developed in this project will be applied to intelligence analysis, command and control, cyberspace operations, electronic warfare, and robotics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The U.S. military operates globally and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists.  Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to produce a rationale to explain the conclusions they reach. If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today most machine learning systems provide no explanations or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user. XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous and decision-support systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates explicit alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources, for use in an environment where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data.  Information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media resulting in only one interpretation, with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. When these independent, impoverished analyses are combined, generally late in the analysis process, the result can be a single apparent consensus view that does not reflect a true consensus. To overcome these limitations, AIDA seeks to research, develop, and demonstrate technology capable of automatically mapping information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregating information, resolving ambiguities, discovering conflicting information, and generating and exploring multiple interpretations of events, situations, or trends of interest. If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternatives and make contingency plans accordingly. Transition partners include operational commands and the intelligence community. AIDA builds on technology developed in the Deep Exploration and Filtering of Text program.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program developed robust speech processing techniques for conditions in which speech signals are degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversation.  Robust speech processing technologies enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or reverberant environment.  Techniques were developed for speech activity detection, language identification, speaker identification, and keyword spotting.  RATS technology was optimized on real world data in conjunction with several operational users.</r2:Description>

Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare by integrating people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids.  Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project ensured DoD net-centric capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks and will enable new cyber-warfighting capabilities.  Promising technologies will transition to system-level projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes intelligence preparation of the cyber battlespace, indications and warning of adversary cyber actions, detection of cyber-attack onset, cyber-attacker identification, and cyber battle damage assessment.  Plan X is creating new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of events on hosts and networks to aid in the planning and execution of cyber warfare.  Plan X will extend operationally meaningful measures to project quantitatively the collateral damage of executed cyber warfare missions.  Plan X funding continues in FY 2017 in Project IT-03.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) program is creating automated defenses that can identify and respond to cyber attacks more rapidly than human operators.  CGC technology will monitor defended software and networks during operations, reason about flawed software, formulate effective defenses, and deploy defenses automatically.  Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, Monte Carlo input generation, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CGC capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  DARPA will incentivize competition through a Grand Challenge in which CGC technologies compete head-to-head.  The CGC program is also funded in Project IT-03.</r2:Description>

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological, chemical and radiological threats included: countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack; host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms; collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors; and integrated defense systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology program element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Advanced Tactical Technology, Aeronautics Technology and Network Centric Enabling Technology.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, and high bandwidth communications.

The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that will enhance the military's effectiveness while decreasing the exposure of U.S. or allied forces to enemy fire.  This project will also explore novel design technologies for the manufacture of ground vehicles and new tools for systems assessments of emerging DARPA technologies.

The Advanced Tactical Technology project focuses on broad technology areas including compact, efficient, frequency-agile, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers for infrared countermeasures, laser radar, holographic laser sensors, communications, and high-power laser applications.

Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion and vehicle concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials for aeronautic system applications.

The Information Analytics Technology project develops applications for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems. Technical challenges include the need to process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes. Efforts address problems related to conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization. Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon. Promising technologies are evaluated in the laboratory and demonstrated in the field to facilitate transition.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES will advance fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Anti-Submarine Warfare  (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation; (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned craft at theater or global ranges, from forward operating bases, under a sparse remote supervisory control model; and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy.  By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level.  The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move.  By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program will emphasize low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems.  Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to Sense, Decide and Act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precision Light Strike Munition (PLSM) program will seek to develop a small, lightweight, shoulder-launched, guided missile weapon for the individual warfighter.  Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions and launchers without the benefit of active guidance.  Current long-range weapons in support of dismounted operations are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but come with a heavy physical burden, high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require teams of operators (sometimes dedicated) for employment.  The program goal is to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided missile systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost.  The program will also explore improvement of existing platform gun systems by leveraging advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads.  PLSM seeks to take advantage of commercial technologies to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability.  The PLSM program could significantly increase the combat power of small units with reduced physical burden, while significantly reducing cost relative to near-peer and peer adversaries.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Ground Experimental Vehicle (GXV) program is to investigate ground vehicle technologies that enable crew/vehicle survivability through means other than traditional heavy passive armor solutions.  This will be accomplished through research and development of novel ground combat and tactical vehicle technology solutions that demonstrate significantly advanced platform mobility, agility, and survivability.  The focus of the GXV program will be on technology development across multiple areas to simultaneously improve military ground vehicle survivability and mobility.  Traditionally, survivability and mobility have to be traded against each other due to the reliance on heavy armor.  The GXV program seeks to break this trend.  Coupled with the development of technologies, the GXV program will define concept vehicles which showcase these developmental technologies.  A modeling and simulation effort will also be undertaken to understand the vehicle design trade space for the concept vehicles using the developmental technologies and to illustrate how these vehicles might be used operationally in combat scenarios.  Technology development areas are likely to include increasing vehicle tactical mobility, survivability through agility, and crew augmentation, though other relevant technologies may also be pursued.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Endurance program developed laser technology to protect airborne platforms from emerging and legacy electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) guided surface-to-air missiles.  The Endurance system planned to have an open architecture, granting the flexibility to integrate different subsystems with varying capabilities.  Endurance is an early application of technology developed through DARPA's Excalibur program and plans to transition to the Services.  The applied research portion of the program focused on miniaturizing the component laser technologies, developing high-precision target identification and tracking, and making a lightweight, agile beam control system to engage high speed targets within the short times needed for aircraft self-defense.  The program also focused on the phenomenology of laser-target interactions and associated threat vulnerabilities.  An advanced technology component of this program, which focused on developing and testing various Endurance subsystems, is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program will design, develop, and demonstrate a kit enabling affordable, rapid automation of selected aircrew functions across a broad range of aircraft.  ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of onboard aircrew to improve performance.  The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

The Gremlins concept envisions small air-launched unmanned systems that can be responsively dispatched in volley quantity from commodity platforms, fly into contested airspace, conduct a moderate duration mission, and ultimately be recovered.  Key enabling technologies for the concept include smaller developmental payloads that benefit from multiple collaborating host platforms.  The Gremlins program will conduct risk reduction and development of the host platform launch and recovery capability and develop and demonstrate a recoverable UAV platform concept.  Enabling platform technologies will include precision relative navigation, advanced computational modeling, variable geometry stores, compact propulsion systems, and high speed digital flight control.  The program will leverage these technologies, perform analytic trade studies, conduct incremental development, and ultimately demonstrate the potential for an integrated air-launched Gremlins unmanned platform.</r2:Description>

The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors on-board a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The Distributed Battle Management program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-on-the-loop operator approval.</r2:Description>

Current search technologies have limitations in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support.  These current technologies impose an iterative search process that is time-consuming and inefficient, typically producing only a fraction of the available information.  Memex is creating a new domain-specific search paradigm to discover relevant content and organize it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks.  In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines will extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content.  Memex technologies will enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories.  Anticipated mission areas include counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. Government activities.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur.  Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks will make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole.  Network Defense is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks.  This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers will enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors.</r2:Description>

The Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments program will develop advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively design, plan and manage missions in complex, hybrid operational environments.  The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with and among a wide variety of stakeholder groups.  These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations each of which has priorities, sensitivities and concerns that may differ significantly.  Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties.  The program will develop tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors.  These will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program, expanding on technical opportunities emerging from the XDATA program, is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes and phenomena.  The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by analysis of sensor and open source data, and the construction of empirical models that enable decision makers to predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning.  The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited in this regard by a shortage of expert data scientists.  D3M will address this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies will include a library of data modeling primitives that is automatically selectable, given data and an outcome; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.  D3M technical development will focus on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Materials Processing and Manufacturing thrust is exploring new manufacturing and processing approaches that will dramatically lower the cost and decrease the time required to fabricate DoD parts and systems.  It will also develop approaches that yield new materials, materials capabilities and parts that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches, as well as address efficient, low-volume manufacturing.  As a result of recent advances in manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing and manufacture on demand, and the push towards programmable hardware in embedded systems, the development cycle from design to production of both hardware and software is severely bottlenecked at the design phase.  Integration of advanced materials with superior properties into manufacturing approaches is also complex and slow, hampering new materials integration and evolution of design.  Research within this thrust will create methods to translate natural inputs into software code and mechanical design, as well as reduce manufacturing complexity through new material feedstock formats with reconfigurable processing technologies.  This thrust is an aggregation of programs previously contained in Multifunctional Materials and Structures.</r2:Description>

In the Reconfigurable Systems thrust, new approaches are being developed to enable more rapid and robust adaptation of military systems and systems-of-systems to changing mission requirements and unpredictable environments.  This includes development of capabilities across sensing, perception, planning and control for autonomous, high-speed operation in cluttered environments without Global Positioning System (GPS) information.  Additional work in this thrust focuses on how systems and systems-of-systems are designed for real-time resilient response to dynamic, unexpected contingencies.  Research is ongoing to develop a more unified view of system behavior that allows better understanding and exploitation of complex interactions among system components, including development of a formal mathematical approach to complex adaptive system composition and design.

Specific approaches include advanced multiplayer gaming technologies to catalyze development of new technology concepts, development of tools for data collection and visualization to accelerate fundamental and applied research, and strategies to understand how seemingly benign commercially available technologies may be converted or combined into threats to military operations, equipment or personnel.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project MS-01.

The program expanded the application of GRIN by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optical systems with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces created the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics and imaging systems.  The program also sought to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic and other inorganic materials to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program was to develop new design tools that enabled optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools and manufacturing processes enabled previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments).  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01.</r2:Description>

One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to map the bioelectric code.  This program will also identify immune function correlates for health and early detection of disease.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, and developing a quantitative framework that can be used to guide modulation of the immune response.  Algorithms will be developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions within an individual.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve our response capability against severe infectious diseases and biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease or organ function.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Changes in the environment including drought, salt-water intrusion, and acute or chronic flooding, as well as introductions of invasive pests and pathogens, present a significant risk to agricultural production.  Conventional methods, such as plant breeding, are generally slow and ineffective against such changes.  Research within this program will investigate novel methods for transmission of genetic materials and the controlled integration of selected genetic elements into plant genomes.  The goal is to develop technologies that can reduce the timeline for agricultural countermeasure development and dissemination, and increase agricultural stability and resilience against evolving environmental changes and pathogens.  The Accelerated Agricultural Engineering program builds upon technologies investigated in the Biological Robustness in Complex Settings program.</r2:Description>

To date, imparted functionality in engineered living systems has been limited by the vast biological complexity of the system and lack of understanding of the relationship between the living system and its local environment.  This program will include research to develop discovery and automation tools as well as synthesis techniques that expand upon the toolbox of genetically encoded constructs and biologic structures for engineered living systems.  This program will enable the design of engineered living systems, expanding approaches for multi-cellular system engineering for natural and extreme environments, higher levels of complexity and system-of-system designs, and self-assembled manufacturing.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronics Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.

This project also recognizes that phenomenal advancements in electronics will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology in the early 21st century, presenting a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. Beyond Scaling programs within the Electronics Technology project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware. These programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit  architectures, for instance by exploiting chip-scale heterogeneous integration of differing material technologies, using "sticky logic" devices that combine computation and memory functions, and vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices.

The project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.

This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Common Heterogeneous integration &amp; IP reuse Strategies (CHIPS) program aims to develop the design tools and integration standards required to better leverage leading-edge commercial sector technologies in DoD systems.  The program aims to realize modular integrated circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers, silicon technologies, and compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  Although integrating CS and silicon has been shown to increase the performance of radio frequency devices, integration is both costly and time consuming.  CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of intellectual property (IP) blocks, including for CS and silicon materials, in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate diverse electronic and photonic components to create a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer for various mission-critical DoD applications.  Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance light detection and ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop standardized, fully digital phased array system components to enable rapid upgrades to DoD communications, electronic warfare, and radar systems.  Phased arrays, which control and steer radio signals, have helped the DoD maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  However, current phased array components are based on custom analog electronics, making them expensive to develop, difficult to upgrade, and time-consuming to deploy.  ACT will address this challenge by leveraging programmable, commercial-off-the-shelf, digital components that can undergo yearly technology refreshes in response to a continually changing threat environment.  This approach can dramatically reduce the time and cost required to develop and update DoD phased arrays.  Further, the ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements typical in the commercial sector could enable the DoD to place phased arrays on inexpensive platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles where they have previously proven prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact radio frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands.  These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in the long-wave infrared thermal (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program aims to greatly improve the cost, size, weight, and performance of free-space optical systems.  These systems enable applications such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging.  Specifically, MOABB aims to construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.  These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics.  CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  Finally, CRAFT will develop and validate various techniques for obscuring sensitive information during the IC manufacturing process, allowing DoD to leverage more of the available onshore semiconductor market.  These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program aims to develop extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations.  Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).  The resulting technologies could enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger detectors in terms of sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and response time to avoid image blur.  These technologies should allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields.  In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal, preferably using the sensing mechanism to do this subtraction.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and ultralow frequency (ULF) communications.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program will develop intrinsically linear radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range.  Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals.  Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  By contrast, existing RF transistor technologies amplify RF signals but produce undesired interference in the RF spectrum due to their poor linearity.  Traditional RF transistor design typically requires a trade-off between high linearity and broadcast range.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new ultra-wide band gap and high carrier mobility materials in novel transistor-level designs and highly-scaled transistor structures.  The resulting device technology should allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum while consuming less system power.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Wireless Autonomous Vehicle Power Transfer (WAVPT) program will develop small footprint, efficient receivers to enable power beaming from a ground-based transmitter to a remote unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  UAVs are currently powered by large, heavy chemical batteries or an engine, with associated liquid fuel.  This consumes a large percentage of the UAV's weight budget and places strict limitations on its range.  Wireless power transfer represents a paradigm-changing solution to power distribution by alleviating the need to carry all energy sources on-board, drastically reducing UAV weight, and increasing aircraft endurance.  Additional power can also be made available for the UAV's payload, allowing use of higher-functionality sensing and computing systems and enabling better data exploitation and threat response.  Previous wireless power transfer experiments have demonstrated delivery of over 30 kilowatts of power over a distance of one kilometer but have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitively large, meter-sized receivers required.  WAVPT will leverage recent advances in directed energy sources and beam-forming capabilities and develop new receiver architectures to demonstrate efficient wireless power transfer in a small form-factor.  Advanced semiconductor materials and processing techniques will be used to develop low-cost, centimeter-sized receivers with high efficiency and energy densities, enabling integration within a small platform.  The program will culminate with a demonstration of hundreds of watts of power being transferred from a ground-based transmitter to a UAV at least one kilometer away.  The technology that is developed within this program can break the inherent tradeoff between mission duration and weight for unmanned vehicles and transform next-generation military systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Intelligent Design of Electronic Artifacts (IDEA) program aims to develop intelligent, free, and open-source development tools and building blocks to provide custom integrated circuits (IC) for mission critical DoD systems. Currently, leading-edge IC development requires large teams of domain experts and costs up to $100M per IC design. These hurdles limit DoD s ability to rapidly access high-performance electronic components and encourage the use of sub-optimal or insecure alternatives. IDEA would reduce the cost and expertise barriers to IC design by leveraging 50 years of chip design knowledge, ongoing advances in machine intelligence, and the incredible growth in public, cloud-based computational resources. The program would develop evolvable, open-source IC design tools and IC building block libraries that can be stored in publicly available cloud infrastructure. This would enable small teams of system and algorithm experts without chip design experience to develop custom ICs at a very low cost and quickly implement these designs in hardware. IDEA would therefore facilitate the development of critical, custom components for the vast majority of DoD missions, including for imaging, communication, electronic warfare, radar, and security applications.</r2:Description>

Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors. However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur. This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels. Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials,  "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies. The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.

As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics cost, speed, and power derived from silicon scaling, the DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies by using design tools that enable circuit specialization. This program will develop and demonstrate the tools required for rapidly designing and deploying specialized circuits. Research efforts will explore technologies and techniques such as new domain-specific circuit architectures; co-design of electronics hardware and software; tight integration of chip-scale processing blocks and artificial intelligence-enabled processing controllers; and open-source circuit designs. Further research will also develop tools to create exact representations of outdated hardware in the field and to rapidly, cheaply, and safely upgrade these systems with next-generation electronics. Previous DARPA and commercial programs on tightly integrated heterogeneous systems, high-speed simulation software, and open-source hardware development provide confidence in this approach. Advances under this program will demonstrate a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program is developing the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light-manipulating) devices, and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC).  This capability would enable dramatic size, weight, and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications, and radar systems.  Historically, chip designers have had to decide between the availability, development, and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  DAHI, however, builds on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone.  DAHI's applied research program focuses on developing and demonstrating high-performance SOC for DoD-specific applications.  The program should also enhance the manufacturing yield and reliability of heterogeneous integration capabilities and demonstrate innovative, advanced microsystems that leverage heterogeneous integration.  Relevant manufacturing processes would be made available to a wide variety of designers from the DoD laboratories, federally funded research and development centers, academia, and industry.  This program has advanced technology development efforts funded in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) program will create microelectronic and mechanical systems capable of physically vanishing in a controlled, triggerable manner.  This advance could help avoid problems associated with unrecovered devices, including their potential use by unauthorized individuals and the compromise of intellectual property.  The resulting technologies could enable a range of applications including vanishing sensors for monitoring large areas of the environment and transient airborne vehicles for emergency resupply without requiring pack out of the air delivery vehicle.  To support this new class of electronics and mechanical structures, VAPR will develop and establish an initial set of transient materials and components along with the required manufacturing processes.  The resulting systems should perform comparably to commercial-off-the-shelf systems while demonstrating system transience that can be programmed, adjusted, triggered, or made to respond to the deployment environment.  VAPR technologies will be demonstrated through two final test platforms.  A vanishing air delivery vehicle capable of precise, gentle drops of small payloads (~3 lbs.) seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of transient structural materials.  A sensor with a wireless link seeks to demonstrate the manufacturability of transient electronics.  Both demonstrations are intended to fully function on their own and to serve as a leading indicator of the potential systems and concepts-of-operation that VAPR could enable.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The IntraChip Enhanced Cooling (ICECool) program incorporated thermal management techniques directly into microelectronics.  This enabled operation of military electronic systems at higher powers while significantly reducing their size and weight.  Today, the high-power operation of military electronics is restricted by the amount of heat created.  ICECool overcame these limitations by significantly increasing the rate of heat removal in microelectronics.  Areas of focus included overcoming the limits of existing thermal management techniques, determining the feasibility of exploiting these techniques within a single chip or stack of chips, and ensuring the reliable operation of microelectronics that produce high levels of heat.  ICECool integrated chip-level thermal management techniques into prototype, high-power electronics in radio frequency arrays and embedded computing systems.  Successful program completion will meet the capability needs of next-generation military systems, enabling increased radar range, improved target tracking, and accelerated processing using high power computing.</r2:Description>

The camera eliminates limitations posed by current camera systems.  PIXNET enabled real-time fusion of thermal and reflected infrared (IR) imagery, allowing the warfighter to better detect camouflaged targets and distinguish decoys.  The program focused on significantly reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of IR sensors, enabling new capabilities for small unmanned aerial vehicles, rifle sights, and vehicle-mounted, helmet-mounted, and handheld systems.  In the future, PIXNET capabilities will also enable real-time wireless sharing of video data, which may support a peer-to-peer image-sharing system for establishing a better common operating picture of the battlefield.</r2:Description>

Today, RF links are allocated and confined to slices of spectrum to prevent interference among users; this however facilitates enemy attempts to jam the link.  HERMES explored a combination of techniques to suppress enemy jammers and guarantee communications in situations where the RF link is critical.  Technology developed under the HERMES program enabled RF links to access tremendous amounts of bandwidth without jeopardizing other links.  Advances under the HERMES program will prove increasingly important given the growing dependence of modern weapons systems on RF links for communications, command and control, geolocation and battle management.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, a joint effort with the Office of Naval Research, is to develop a systems approach for, and perform technical demonstration of, a Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MALE UAV) capability from smaller ships.  The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  The transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program is to enhance mission performance, reduce cost, confound adversaries, and reduce reliance on space assets for navigation and communication by distributing mission functions such as sensing, communication, precision navigation, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects to small platforms and increasing their level of autonomy.  Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets through autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.

HAWC will pursue flight demonstration of the critical technologies for an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile.  These technologies include advanced air vehicle configurations capable of efficient hypersonic flight, hydrocarbon scramjet-powered propulsion to enable sustained hypersonic cruise, thermal management approaches designed for high-temperature cruise, and affordable system designs and manufacturing approaches.  HAWC technologies also extend to reusable hypersonic air platforms for applications such as global presence and space lift.  The HAWC program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon, X-51, and HyFly programs.  This is a joint program with the Air Force, and HAWC technologies are planned for transition to the Air Force after flight testing is complete.</r2:Description>

The program will also consider traceability to, and ideally compatibility, with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.

The program will build and flight test an unmanned 10,000 - 12,000 lb. aircraft capable of sustained speeds in excess of 300 kt, demonstrate system level hover efficiency within 25 percent of the ideal power loading, and a lift-to-equivalent drag ratio no less than ten.  Additionally, the demonstrator will be designed to have a useful load of no less than 40 percent of the gross weight with a payload capacity of at least 12.5 percent of the gross weight.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies to enable new and vastly improved operational capabilities.  Technologies developed under this program will be made available to all Services for application to future air systems development.

                                                    <r2:Description>Current and future land and ship-to-shore operations will require rapid and distributed employment of U.S. forces on the battlefield.  The Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES) program will develop a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), modular unmanned air vehicle that can carry a 3,000 lb. useful load at a range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel.  ARES will enable distributed operations and access to compact, high altitude landing zones to reduce warfighter exposure to hostile threats and bypass ground obstructions.  ARES modular capability allows for mission modules to be quickly interchanged and deployed at the company level.  This enables the flexible employment of many different capabilities including: cargo resupply, casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, weapons platforms, and other types of operations.  ARES vehicles could be dispatched to resupply isolated small units.  ARES is well suited for enhanced company operations concepts that would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.  The enabling technologies of interest developed under the ARES program includes vertical and translational flight, conversion between powered lift and wing borne lift, ducted fan propulsion systems, lightweight materials, tailless configuration, modularity, and advanced over-actuated flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  Additionally, the program will explore opportunities for the design, development, and integration of new, key technologies and capabilities.  These include adaptable landing gear concepts to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch/recovery platforms, and autonomous take off and landing.  The anticipated transition partners for this effort are the Army, Marine Corps, and Special Operations Forces.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel power/propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing or assembly processes, and precision control of multi-payload systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The XS-1 program will mature the technologies and operations for low cost, persistent and responsive space access and global reach.  Past efforts have identified and demonstrated critical enabling technologies including composite or light weight structures, propellant tanks, thermal protection systems, rocket propulsion and advanced avionics/software.  A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 flights in 10 days,  2) up to Mach 10+ flight, and 3) design capable of a 10X lower cost space access for cargos from 3,000-5,000 lbs. to low earth orbit.  A key goal is validating the critical technologies for a wide range of next generation high speed aircraft enabling new military capabilities including worldwide reconnaissance, global transport, small responsive space access aircraft and affordable spacelift.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

The enabling technologies of interest are extremely lightweight and space capable deployable antenna structures.  Current deployable antenna options have not been sufficiently developed to be dependable on small payload launches, leaving current capabilities trending to large and more costly satellite systems.  These satellite systems are expected to have long operational lifetimes, which can leave them behind the pace of state-of-the-art technical developments.  The technologies developed under Radar Net will enable small, low-cost sensor payloads on short timescales with rapid technology refresh capabilities.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>To date, servicing operations have never been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO).  A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) altitudes; furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation that such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) tele-operated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and expanding beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program will examine utilization of a new commercial ride-along system to GEO called Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system, supporting small satellite delivery as well as hardware delivery for upgrading, repairing, assembling, and reconfiguring satellites.  In addition, the program will include a LEO flight experiment focused on satlets, modular building blocks for space systems, as a path of risk reduction for modular assembly on orbit.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, the Army, and the commercial spacecraft and spacecraft servicing providers.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), providing persistence and enabling ground station antennas to point in a fixed direction.  Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program, an outgrowth of the Phoenix program budgeted within this Project, seeks to establish the capability to acquire robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer. To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Large In-Situ Manufactured Apertures (LIMA) program seeks to demonstrate the structural fabrication of a high-performance radio frequency (RF) antenna attached to a microsatellite.  Larger and more directional than any comparable antenna that could be deployed from a microsatellite platform, LIMA would deliver high-performance communication and data services to the dismounted warfighter at significantly lower cost while enabling signal intelligence (SIGINT) capability.  The program will complete a low Earth orbit (LEO) small-scale demonstration in which a commercial communications microsatellite is augmented in situ (i.e., on orbit, in flight) with an antenna that is completely fabricated in space, and will prove by computational modeling and simulation how a constellation of full-scale microsatellites with In-situ fabricated apertures may be applied to close a high-performance RF link directly to a cellular hand set in a global tactical communications network.  The program seeks to achieve greater than 50% savings in individual communications satellite system launch costs and a corresponding increase in launch opportunities due to ride sharing relative to the preferred state of the art solution.</r2:Description>

Capabilities developed will support integrating spacecraft-derived information into the space domain awareness picture. Key efforts focus on the development of an identification and information device for every space object placed in orbit to provide accurate data.  Resulting capabilities will aid in rapid determination of space objects, particularly in the case of multi-spacecraft deployments. Inherent to the space identification technology is the ability to provide forensic data for failed or anomalous spacecraft.  Other areas to be investigated include leveraging small satellite mega-constellations and their networks to provide ID, state, and sensor data in support of this and other applications.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program has developed and demonstrated an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability.  A major goal of the SST program, to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance has been achieved.  This capability enables ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The system transitioned to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).

The SST Australia effort developed advanced algorithms, equipment, and concepts of operation to achieve comparable telescope performance in the more challenging Australian atmosphere.   This enhanced capability was demonstrated at White Sands Missile Range, allowing estimates of the performance in Australia to be validated.  This program addressed technical challenges which arise from an Australian site, including adaptations to a different telescope environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technologies program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility.  Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project funded a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation, power generation, sensing, and actuation to realize new technologies for perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, this project applied the advantages of miniaturization and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems. The project addressed issues that ranged from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. The resulting technologies will be applied to microscale precision, navigation, and timing systems; microscale components that survive harsh environments; and tactically-relevant MEMS systems that operate in a variety of thermal and vibration environments.

The Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs. Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) self-contained laser weapon systems to protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital) or mixed semiconductor technology to substantially improve the capability of existing components and/or reduce their size, weight and power. Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term
and other future warfighting requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, this project applied the advantages of miniaturization and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The project addressed issues that ranged from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The resulting technologies could be applied to microscale precision, navigation, and timing systems; microscale components that survive harsh environments; and tactically-relevant MEMS systems that operate in a variety of thermal and vibration environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, &amp; Timing (micro-PNT) program developed low-cost, size, weight, and power (CSWaP) sensors and timing devices for navigation in GPS-degraded environments.  The program primarily focused on improving microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, which currently display limited performance but excellent CSWaP, and miniaturizing atomic gyroscopes and clocks, which are currently limited to laboratory experiments because of their complexity and high CSWaP.  To enhance MEMS sensor performance and realize low-CSWaP atomic sensors, the program developed novel microfabrication processes, investigated new material systems, and contributed to the understanding of error sources.  Innovative microfabrication techniques development allowed co-fabrication of dissimilar devices on a single chip that enabled the required clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and calibration components to integrate into a small, low-power architecture.  Ultimately, low-CSWaP inertial sensors and clocks enabled ubiquitous guidance and navigation on all platforms, including guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), and mounted and dismounted soldiers.  Service labs have been actively involved throughout the program and are facilitating transition of micro-PNT technology to Service-led programs for further development and testing.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to reject these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. ReImagine builds upon the multifunctional imager concept in the Pixel Network (PIXNET) program which is budgeted in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01. Where PIXNET focused on multiple functions in the detector layer, ReImagine adds multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program seeks to leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for electromagnetic (EM) arrays. EM arrays, which enable communications, radar and electronic warfare (EW), are currently high performance but slow and costly to create.  In contrast, they must evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats.  However, the available design and test infrastructure is not flexible enough to support testing and fielding new EM array algorithms across a wide variety of military platforms.  Furthermore, EM software and hardware are often developed in separate silos; as a result, implementing new EM applications in hardware tends to require a lengthy and expensive development process with extended cycles of iteration between the two areas.  RAD will therefore focus on three core areas: (1) making ultra-flexible testbeds for existing and future EM arrays accessible to the DoD community; (2) reducing the complexity of phased array hardware through high level abstraction; and (3) speeding up EM system development time through hardware/software co-design.  In light of changing requirements, the resulting technologies would also enable DoD greater reuse of its available hardware resources while minimizing the need to modify specialized EM systems, leading to improved and simplified upgrade cycles.  Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the services through a series of demonstrations proving the radically shorter time scale of development.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Efficient Ultra-Compact Laser-Integrated Diodes (EUCLID) program aims to significantly reduce the size of laser diode pump modules (DPMs) while increasing their electrical-to-optical efficiency.  DPMs are a critical component of fiber-laser array weapons systems, which combine light from many lower-power lasers to engage targets at tactically-relevant distances.  Commercial DPMs, which cater to the laser manufacturing industry, feature large cooling systems and are too cumbersome for integration into many small DoD platforms.  EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts.  The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes.  The resulting EUCLID DPMs are intended to be available for procurement and integration into ultra-low size, weight, and power fiber-laser array weapons systems, enabling integration into a variety of Air Force, Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency platforms.</r2:Description>

High-performance RF components enable the DoD to deploy sophisticated payloads on high-value platforms.  However, new DoD concepts of operation require a significant reduction in RF hardware power consumption and size.  RF CLOUDS will develop the components required for swarms of small autonomous systems.  These RF components would work together across a swarm of nodes, sharing measurements of the electromagnetic spectrum, combining radiated energy to transmit signals, and managing unwanted energy emissions to avoid detection.  This node-based, collaborative approach is expected to allow for enhanced RF system performance while lowering the performance requirement and cost for each individual node.  These improvements would allow DoD to transition from placing high-performance RF hardware on a few high-value platforms to deploying a large number of low-cost autonomous nodes for pervasive stand-in electromagnetic access of denied areas.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The FLASH program aims to demonstrate an ultra-low-size, weight, and power (SWaP) high energy laser system suitable for integration onto a range of military platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 4th and 5th generation aircraft.  The laser system would significantly enhance the platforms defensive capabilities against electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) guided missiles.  With its modular, scalable architecture, future systems could be built with output power levels in the hundreds of kilowatts, enabling a broad set of offensive mission capabilities, many of which are not possible with current technology.  To accomplish its program goals, FLASH will pursue two major thrusts.  First, FLASH aims to greatly reduce the size and weight of high-power fiber laser amplifiers, increase their power efficiency and improve their resistance to shock, vibration and acoustic stresses found on military platforms.  Second, FLASH aims to fabricate an array of these amplifiers and integrate them into a transportable system with advanced battery power, thermal management and coherent-beam combination sub-systems.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy, Army and Missile Defense Agency.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) program is developing the design and manufacturing capabilities required to seamlessly integrate various semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems, photonic (light-manipulating) devices and thermal management structures into true systems-on-a-chip (SOC).  This capability would enable dramatic size, weight and volume reductions and higher performance for DoD electronic warfare, communications and radar systems.  Historically, chip designers have had to decide between the availability, development and low cost of silicon circuits or the high performance of compound semiconductor (CS) materials.  DAHI, however, builds on previous DARPA and commercial efforts, which demonstrated that heterogeneously integrating CS and silicon can yield significant performance improvements over silicon or CS alone.  DAHI's advanced technology development effort focuses on establishing a technologically mature manufacturing path for integrating a wide array of materials and devices, including CS, on a common substrate.  Relevant manufacturing processes would be made available to a wide variety of designers from the DoD laboratories, federally funded research and development centers, academia and industry.  DAHI will also support demonstrating increasingly complex circuits that leverage heterogeneous integration.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Direct SAMpling Digital ReceivER (DISARMER) program aimed to design, fabricate and test a digital wideband receiver which captures and digitizes electromagnetic (EM) spectrum signals with potential applications for electronic warfare and signals intelligence.  The hybridized receiver would integrate photonic (light-manipulating) and electronic components in a standard form factor.  Conventional digital wideband receivers are limited in their dynamic range, which determines their resilience to jammers and drives their ability to detect and record faint signals.  DISARMER sought to overcome this limitation by employing an ultra-stable optical clock, which would allow systems to sample the spectrum with greater precision.  The DISARMER receiver would improve spur-free dynamic range 100x over the state of the art and prove capable of coherently sampling the entire, tactically-relevant, X-band (8-12 GHz) portion of the spectrum.  Such a wide-bandwidth, high-fidelity receiver would also have the potential to drastically reduce the cost, size and weight of electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon. While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces. Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
- High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
- Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
- Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.
- Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon.  While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users.  The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
-  High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
-  Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, and scalability.
-  Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.
-  Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking requirements of deployed military forces.  DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system has broken the 10 Gb/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency, but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current ORCA system.  The 100 Gb/s RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the radio frequency (RF) environment, enabling reliable and assured communications, as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their situational awareness, understanding, or response.  Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) challenges, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  The Advanced RF Mapping program will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs within this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program will seek to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century. Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems will strain the size of networks that our current communications technology can support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advance, the DoD will need new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addresses these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, to develop heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols will be developed.  Second, to create a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that draws from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community can build specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E will create a government controlled development environment to allow rapid refresh of communications technology and allow third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program are planned to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters/features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked data/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor/radar bands.  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>A highly networked and enabled force increases efficiency, effectiveness, and safety by making relevant information available when it is needed and at the appropriate location (person/platform/system).  Accomplishing this depends on providing reliable wireless communications to all U.S. forces, platforms, and devices in all phases of conflict.  Based on initial work under this effort, the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program in this PE/Project was created to enable reliable operation of military and commercial communications and radar systems when occupying the same spectrum bands.  As part of the Advanced Networks technologies effort, the Wireless Network Defense program increases wireless network capacity and reliability for tactical users, with the ultimate vision of making high quality data services pervasive throughout the DoD.  The primary focus is mitigation of advanced threats particular to the security of wireless networks.  The program intends to leverage the capabilities of the dynamic network to identify sources of misinformation, whether malicious or due to poor configuration, across the functional components of the complex system, and mitigate the corresponding effects.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to properly leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to further streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications) while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification, as well as tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic replanning capability, and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  The RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future.  The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT will achieve this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge is to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system will sense the target's emissions and then optimally configure the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  The ReACT program builds upon technology developed under the Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program, which is budgeted in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and will culminate with a flight demonstration of distributed beamforming.  The ReACT technology is planned to transition to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

SESU-developed capabilities will provide the small unit with better indications and warning of an invasion or attack, the means to deter such an attack, and if the attack occurs, the ability to delay the adversary advance to allow sufficient time for reinforcements.  Technologies to accomplish this will include command, control, &amp; communications (C3) to interoperate with host-nation forces, distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources, and hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities.  A major thrust within the SESU program will be technology to enable manned-unmanned teaming with a focus on C3 and autonomy of the unmanned capabilities without placing an undue burden on the human operators.  SESU technologies will be integrated using systems of systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSite) program, also budgeted in this Program Element/Project.  Testing and experimentation will be conducted with Service partners, and technologies produced by this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships, and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program is to dramatically improve U.S. Navy submarine superiority.  HyDem will apply breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies, and multi-disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance.  The U.S. Navy's ability to operate their submarine fleet with improved capability allows for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines could exploit expanded areas which were previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The HyDem program will design, manufacture, and supply the Navy with a novel component for integration into a new construction Virginia Class submarine.  The Navy will evaluate this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Ohio Replacement submarines, and back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines.  This program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment.  This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  By leveraging techniques explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program budgeted within this PE/Project, the Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operating standards; and rapid, cost effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to temporarily restore connectivity for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with future scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise.  Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program seeks to provide a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges to be addressed include: dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program will leverage Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies and culminate in a series of at-sea demonstrations and transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in ocean basins over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  Building upon concepts explored under the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program, budgeted within this PE/Project, and the Upward Falling Payloads program, PE 0602702E, Project TT-03, the POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around the ocean basin.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain, maintain, and re-acquire, if lost, an initial location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus trilaterate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability.  Building upon research conducted under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSite) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.  Through experimentation, the program will not only demonstrate integrated system performance, but also develop new tactics that capitalize on features created by the heterogeneous architecture.  The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will invest in technologies that will reduce cost, manage complexity, and improve reliability.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program will provide the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment.  The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors will have a transformative impact on a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning.  For all of these applications, coherent sensor gain is currently achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays.  Based on technologies explored in the Mobile Offboard C2 and Attack (MOCCA) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the TEAC program will create the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively and semi-autonomously to focus energy undersea.  This concept would provide an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles, ocean energy sources, and new acoustic source technologies. Technologies developed under this program are intended to transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

The VAMS program seeks to develop and demonstrate technologies that enable projection of underwater acoustic sensor arrays with performance comparable to existing arrays.  The VAMS approach, however, will allow enabling capabilities that are not currently possible with existing technology.  Expanding on lessons learned from the Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program, budgeted within this PE/Project, the program will combine novel transmitters with novel signal extraction methods and exploit new and emerging high-speed sensor and processor capabilities.  The VAMS system has the potential to be integrated into a number of underwater platforms.  The acoustic sensor technology developed under the VAMS program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms.  In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program's goal was to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep-ocean sonar nodes were developed to operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths, permitted a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  At-sea demonstrations revealed that the detection capability has been achieved.  The program developed prototype systems that evolved through additional at-sea testing.  These tests demonstrated the ability to integrate into the Navy's undersea systems responsible for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).  The program achieved breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  DASH technologies have transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. 

The Exploitation Systems project developed algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) datasets. In particular, it developed new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis. Interest extended to open source information and issues such as trustworthiness and provenance. The resulting technology enables operators to more effectively and efficiently incorporate all sources of information, including sensor, human, and open source data, in intelligence products.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Multi-Optical Sensing (MOS) program will enable an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-optical sensing system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program seeks to advance the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within line-of-sight (LOS) of friendly assets.  Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons:  they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other movers.  Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon technologies developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSite) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to rapidly detect, track, and classify UAS incursions, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads, to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-wide sized areas.

Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems Project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and static due to pre-programmed target lists and operating mode, limiting mission execution capabilities.  Extending ATR Technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operation limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, sparse representations, manifold learning, and embedded systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR Technology.  The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR technology; (2) recognition technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software footprint of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Seeker Cost Transformation (SECTR) program will develop novel weapon terminal sensing and guidance technologies and systems, for air-launched and air-delivered weapons, that can: (1) find and acquire fixed and moving targets with only minimal external support; (2) achieve high navigation accuracy in a GPS-denied environment; and (3) have very small size and weight, and potentially low cost.  The development objectives are technologies and systems with small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, applicability to a wide range of weapons and missions such as small unit operations, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and time-sensitive targets.  The technical approach for the sensing/processing hardware is to use both passive electro-optical infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture, such as the architecture developed in DARPA's Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors (ADAPT) program.  The program will also develop a Government-owned open architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software).

                                                    <r2:Description>The Small Satellite Sensors program will develop and space-qualify electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor and inter-satellite communications technologies, and establish feasibility that new DoD tactical capabilities can be implemented on small (&lt; 100 kg) satellites.  Experimental payloads will be flown on small satellites, and data will be collected to validate new operational concepts.  Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.  The program will focus on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program will pursue new algorithms for rapidly protecting DoD systems against new or unknown radar-based threats.  Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed electronic countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop.  The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging.  Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient.  ARC will therefore pursue new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system and then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  The program is planned for transition to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems.</r2:Description>

Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time consuming to build and integrate onto platforms.  Expanding on ideas developed under the Multifunction RF program, also budgeted in this PE/Project, the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems.  This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a system and sensor resource manager (SSRM)).  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.  Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The goal of this program, building on technologies developed under the Multifunction RF (MFRF) program which is budgeted in this PE/Project, is to demonstrate a new imaging radar architecture using an electronically scanned sub-reflector to produce a more readily available, cost-effective sensor solution that does not require platform or target motion.  Key system attributes will: (1) provide high-resolution 3D imaging for enhanced identification and targeting, independent of platform or target motion; (2) produce video frame rates to provide well-focused images even when there is platform or target motion; (3) beam steer with a single transmit/receive chain to reduce system complexity resulting in lower cost, power, and weight; and (4) integrate millimeter-wave (mmW)/terahertz (THz) electronic component advancements from other DARPA programs for transmit and receive functions.  The completion of this program will result in a more readily available, cost-effective imaging radar technology that will work in concert with a wide area surveillance system to provide target identification at video frame rates in all conditions where existing sensors will not work.  Candidate military applications include efficient terminal seekers, imaging systems for defense of shipping in ports and littoral environments, base perimeter monitoring, and screening of personnel passing through access control points.  This technology is intended to transition to Special Operations Command and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Multifunction RF (MFRF) program goal is to enable U.S. rotary wing aircraft forces to fight effectively in all forms of severely Degraded Visual Environments (DVE) when our adversaries cannot.  The program goes beyond landing aids in DVE to address all elements of combat to include landing, takeoff, hover/taxi, in route navigation, lethality, and survivability.  Building on previous RF sensors advancements, the program seeks to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently developed situational and combat support systems to provide multifunction capability with flexibility of adding new mission functions.  This will reduce the overall size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of subsystems and protrusive exterior antennas on military aircraft, enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.  The program approach includes: (1) development of synthetic vision for pilots that fuses sensor data with high-resolution terrain databases; (2) development of Advanced Rotary Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), utilizing silicon-based tile arrays, for agile electronically scanning technology at low SWAP-C; and (3) implementation of software development kit to re-define modes as required by mission or platform needs, and ease of adding new modes via software without hardware modifications.  The program is planned for transition to the Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J aircraft in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program seeks to develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program is developing a fundamentally new optical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability that provides high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems.  Short, moderate, and long-range prototype optical surveillance and observation systems are being developed that: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage.  The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight, and power (SWaP) of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform integration.  The MIST program will transition the optical ISR technology to the Services and Special Operations Command (SOCOM).</r2:Description>

Insight provided new exploitation capabilities through an integrated, standards-based system that is designed for mission flexibility and cross-theater applicability.  Insight enabled threat detection through combination and analysis of information from imaging and non-imaging sensors and other sources.  The technical approach emphasized graph-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, and on-line learning.  Insight development activities leveraged both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enabled evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enabled live testing under realistic operational conditions using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development was coordinated with the following transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office - Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (PEO IE&amp;WS), United States Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE), Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System - Army (PM DCGS-A), Air Staff, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Air Force Research Laboratory, and an operational command partner.  There are MOAs or MOUs in place with each of these transition stakeholders.  Insight provided a unified architecture for plug-and-play ISR with extensibility to all Services and Combatant Commands.</r2:Description>

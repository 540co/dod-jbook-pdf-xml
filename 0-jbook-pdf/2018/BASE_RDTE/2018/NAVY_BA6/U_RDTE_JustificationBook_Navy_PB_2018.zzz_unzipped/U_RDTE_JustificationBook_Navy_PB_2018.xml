                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The funding increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 supports upgrades to the Naval Air Warfare Center land and sea ranges to close capability gaps identified during the operational  test (OT) planning for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) by Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).   The gaps exist in several categories including threat density, type of threat and representation of specific threat systems and, if not mitigated, will prevent an effective OT for JSF.   The requested funding will procure 12 systems, in four categories, that increase the threat density, threat type and specific threat representation and upgrade an additional two systems to provide a higher fidelity representation of several threat types.   Additionally,  funding supports the initiation of site preparation and integration for radar signal emulators and the requirement to purchase additional materials for the open air radio frequency beam measurement capability.

The funding increase in the ENEWS program from FY17 to FY18 reflects the addition of one hardware simulator to the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems (ENEWS) hardware simulators to support the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 3.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. The Navy has been very successful in executing all of its major programs, and to date has had no major technical problems.

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: ALR-67(v) 3, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures Suite ALQ-214, the AAR-47 (v) 3, AVR-2, ALQ-144A, Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, LR700, Low Band Transmitter, P-8A, and the Next Generation Jammer.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Funding decreases from FY16 to FY17 due to the completion of the open-loop threat simulators.  

The funding increase from FY 2017 to FY 2018 supports upgrades to the Naval Air Warfare Center land and sea ranges to close capability gaps identified during the operational  test (OT) planning for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) by Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations.  The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy.  The heavy use of Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project.  The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics.  In the past Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation.  Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios.  One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats.  The Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan.  This plan employs many of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics.  As part of its normal activities, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes.  Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process.  In addition, Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Perform characterization of Infrared and Radio Frequency simulators as part of the periodic evaluation of simulation performance and collect performance data for comparison with previously recorded data.  Also includes development and maintenance of all simulator control panels.

The decrease between FY 2016 and FY 2017 is due to the completion of a simulator capability upgrade.

The increase between FY 2017 and FY 2018 is due to the addition of one hardware simulator to the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems inventory and the requirement for Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems  hardware simulators to support the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 3. These requirements include Operational Assessment (OA) and Factory Qualification Tests (FQT) in FY 2018 and preparing hardware simulators to support Developmental Testing (DT) and First Article Qualification Test (FAQT) scheduled for FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Provides for the documentation of Anti-Ship Capable Missile (ASMC) threat simulators. Develops reports that contain detailed descriptions and parametric data of the Anti-Ship Capable Missile threat simulators and compares the simulator's parametric data to the actual threat's parametric data.  Provide technical management functions in support of the Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems project; engineering and technical support requirements for the Anti-Ship Capable Missile simulators and upgrades to meet DT/ OT testing requirements, development of detailed test resource requirements and provides an interface between OPNAV N2/N6, Office of Naval Research, and Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems oversight activities.

Beginning in FY 2015 the simulator validation effort was terminated and no more validation reports will be published. Effectiveness of Navy Electronic Warfare Systems  will continue to develop simulator documentation reports that will include a simulator description with a comparison to the threat it represents.

Formerly know as "SIMULATION VALIDATION AND REQUIREMENTS" is now titled "SIMULATION CHARACTERIZATION, VERIFICATION AND REQUIREMENTS" effective FY 2017.

The increase between FY 2017 and FY 2018 is due to the scheduled characterization of two hardware simulators in FY 2018.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:

 - Supersonic Targets: GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) and GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) program.  Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats.  The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and, to a lesser degree, support fleet training.  Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM).  GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft.  The GQM-163A has also demonstrated a capability to perform a higher altitude diving threat profile.  Funding was also provided for closing out the GQM-173A (MSST) program.  MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015.  Remaining funds are planned to cover settlement costs.

 - Subsonic Targets: BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test &amp; evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.

 - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems(TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC/TA/AS) development: The TTSP provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters).  TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS including but not limited to: scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe, and associated test sets.  TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide high fidelity simulation of foreign threats.  TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics.  TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar and vector scoring systems.

 In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Supersonics: The GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) is an Acquisition Category II program. Development strategy includes the continued development of the Quad Launch capability. The SSST program will also commence the development and design efforts for a new Radome and Radar Altimeter and other Engineering Change Proposals as required to emulate emerging threat systems. These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&amp;E requirements.

Congress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.

Subsonics: The BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target program is an Acquisition Category IVM program. It is currently undergoing developmental testing with Critical Design Review, Test Readiness Review / Flight Readiness Review completed in FY16 and Milestone C completed in 1st Quarter FY17. A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 1 option contract is scheduled to be awarded in 3rd Quarter FY17. IOC is scheduled for 4th Quarter FY18. After exercising a second prenegotiated option for LRIP 2 in FY18, the program will transition to Full Rate Production in FY19.

Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: TTSP will continue to award contracts to support the development of electronic attack &amp; threat radar simulations, ensuring the fleet requirement for simulations of emerging threats is met. Additional contracts will be awarded to support the development and design of TMSS upgrades, including but not limited to the current and next generation Target Control Systems, Scalar Scorers, Scoring Ground Station, Telemetry Antennas, Radar and Locator Beacons, Identification Friend or Foe and associated test sets.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic Portfolio Management Methodology used to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. The effort expands on Portfolio Management Decision Support System by capturing and mapping issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This PE provides funding to support continuing need for studies and analysis of issues critical to decisions required by the Chief of Naval Personnel and his staff regarding manpower, personnel, training and education policies, and programs that have far-reaching implications to service members and the Navy budget.  This PE supports research of both Naval Postgraduate School faculty and students, and in FY10 began the formulation of focused economic research, to include behavioral economics.  This focus will provide continuing analysis and research to facilitate the data gathering and synthesis to provide consistent and timely update to economic indicators to use in the numerous models that support management decisions within the MPTE arena that have significant impact on the efficient use of the nearly $27B Manpower &amp; Personnel, Navy budget.  The economic research will consolidate the data necessary to perform elasticity estimations and maintain this data for subsequent estimations.  To gather the data necessary to perform such estimations, would conservatively cost more than $300K on each such occasion.  The MPTE enterprise uses dozens of models, most of which require elasticity updates.  Consolidating the data repository to support this analysis will result in a cost avoidance of more than $1M and this does not include any of the actual model revisions.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis, and cost analysis requirements in support of systems engineering activities, analyses of alternatives, and development of the 30-Year Aviation Plan, a Congressionally mandated product. Due to high turnover and end of service life of several Naval aircraft set against increasing threat capabilities, DOD 5000 series mandates documentation of capability requirements and mechanisms to obtain these capabilities. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability realizing (or achieving) reductions to technical risks and overall program costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) is the Department of the Navy's (DoN) only Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). CNA provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through its world-wide field program. CNA's research program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance CNA's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DoD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. CNA conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Marine Corps portion of the Department of Navy, CNA, Center for Naval Analysis Research Program, and is managed as an element of the Marine Corps Studies System. This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  

The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&amp;RA). The program continues analytical support for field exercises, Ad Hoc and Quick Response study requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Continued research analysis, modeling and simulation data that focused analytical support to the Special Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) Crisis Response (CR) that provides critical mission research advise to unit commanders.
- Continued support for current operations to include: weapons and systems programs, MAGTF training and exercise assessments, amphibious shipping capabilities, and reductions to naval operations and strategic commitments.  Analysis and solutions relating to support and sustainment in terms of equipment readiness, training, responsiveness and maintaining squadron readiness, development of facilities sustainment and service life programs save the Marine Corps valuable time and resources.  Manpower, force structure, aviation recruiting and retention, and valuations of recruiting, retaining and retiring Marines analyses provide viable personnel solutions in times of shrinking resources.  Intelligence capabilities assessments, analyses of threat assessments from known and unknown enemies, i.e. Al-Qaeda, Northern Africa and Iran, and Joint Irregular Warfare Analytic Baseline (JIWAB) development provide valuable information to assist Marine Corps Intelligence organizations in keeping the force educated and safe.
- Continued high priority study and analysis projects approved in FY15 Marine Corps Studies System Master Plan (MCSSMP).
- Continued research analysis, and survey support efforts associated with development and implantation of the Marine Forces Integration Plan (MCFIP) Women in Infantry.
- Initiated high priority study and analysis projects approved in FY16 Marine Corps Studies System Master Plan (MCSSMP).</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This project supports the Marine Corps portion of the Department of Navy, CNA Center for Naval Analysis Research Program, and is managed as an element of the Marine Corps Studies System. This program provides the Marine Corps with independent and objective research and analysis of specific issues/topics appropriately performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Marine Corps Division analysts work at CNA headquarters and, through CNA's Field representative Program, serve at commands worldwide, including:  Marine Forces Command, Marine Forces Pacific, Marine Special Operations Command, the three Marine Expeditionary Forces, Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1), and in Iraq, providing on-site analysis to deployed Marine forces there. CNA also assigns analysts to support the Deputy Commandants and their staffs as well as other Marine Corps organizations such as the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, Marine Corps Systems Command, and the Commander, Marine Forces Reserve.  

The program areas are linked to the Marine Corps Advocacy (prepotency), which are: (1) Logistics and Infrastructure; (2) Manpower and Training; (3) Research, Development and Acquisition; (4) Operations and Plans; (5) Programs and Resources; (6) Aviation; (7) Combat Development and Integration; and (8) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Scientific Analyst support provides six scientific analysts for the following six focus areas: Deputy Commandant (DC), Plans, Policies and Operations; DC Aviation; DC Installation and Logistics; DC Programs and Resources; DC Manpower Reserve Affairs; and Director, Manpower Plans (MP) - Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&amp;RA). 

The Marine Corps' portion of the CNA program is executed via the Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) Annual Plan which is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The MCSS maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the Marine Corps.  The MCSS ensures there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the Marine Corps.  Additionally, the Operations Analysis Division of Combat Integration Division (CD&amp;I, MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the Marine Corps and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter for research and analysis.  

Other evaluation processes are as follows: 
A) Contract Status Meetings: The Marine Corps participates in contract status meetings. The Contracting Officer chairs monthly meetings with the Marine Corps, and members of the CNA Business Support Group to provide guidance regarding contract management to include reviewing the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) database requirements to emphasize the contractual requirement that all ongoing research be submitted to DTIC to ensure against duplication to reviewing CNA's cost effectiveness and efficiency.

B) Marine Corps Three-Star Flag Officer Review: The Commanding General, CD&amp;I, MCCDC and the Director, Operations Analysis Division (OAD) frequently to review the current research program and provide guidance to CNA regarding future research requirements. Meetings are essential to provide CNA to ensure that research conducted is of the greatest value to the Marine Corps. The meetings serve as a roadmap for future projects. The Marine Corps' research plan is consolidated with the DoN's Annual Plan that is submitted to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Capabilities and Resources (N8) for final review and acceptance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>CNA is reviewed throughout the research year on several different levels to ensure that research produced is not duplicated elsewhere. The primary (and most effective) method of review for duplication is the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) review and approval of each and every project proposal submitted by CNA. This method is highly effective in providing the necessary oversight to ensure that duplication of effort does not occur. The Marine Corps Studies System (MCSS) maintains a comprehensive listing of all CNA studies performed for the USMC. The MCSS ensures that there are no duplicate analytical efforts within the USMC. Additionally, the Studies and Analysis Division of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) provides analytical review of all CNA products for the USMC and integrates the results and recommendations into a quarterly newsletter and an annual plan for research and analysis. 
Other evaluation processes: 

A) DoN Contract Status Meetings: As part of the CNA oversight process, the Office of Naval Research Contracting Officer chairs a monthly meeting with the COTR, the USMC, and the CNA's Chief Financial Office to provide guidance regarding contract management. 

B) Two-Star Flag Officers and VCNO Corporate Board Meetings: DoN Two-Star and their equivalent civilian counterparts meet several times a year to review the current fiscal year's research and provide guidance to CNA regarding their future research for DoN. These high level meetings are essential to provide CNA with DoN's guidance to ensure that the research conducted is of the greatest value to DoN. The meetings also serve as the catalyst for the formation of the CNA Annual Plan, CNA's roadmap for research during the upcoming fiscal year. The CNA Annual Plan is then submitted to VCNO/N8 for final review and acceptance. 

C) CNA Comprehensive Review: Prior to contract renewal, CNA, as an Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), must be evaluated to ensure that the DoN wants to renew CNA's contract for an additional five year period. DoN completes an exhaustive review of sponsors' technical needs and mission requirements; DoN's consideration of other sources; CNA's efficiency and effectiveness; CNA's management and cost effectiveness; as well as the FFRDC establishment criteria and sponsorship agreement. The CNA Comprehensive Review is approved by ASN (RDA) and accepted by OSD (AT&amp;L).

D) Navy-CNA Integration Board.  DON 3-stars and CNA leadership meet quarterly to review the annual research program, discuss priorities and related implications for current and future work, and address issues impacting CNA's ability to execute its mission as an FFRDC.  CNA research highlights are also briefed and discussed.  The board meetings are chaired by the Director, Navy Staff.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3% for SBIR in FY 2016.  This funds R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3% for SBIR in FY 2016.  This funds R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3% for SBIR in FY 2016.  This funds R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3% for SBIR in FY 2016. This funds R&amp;D at small businesses. The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase 1 and Phase II's awarded based on Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) issued three times a year for SBIR describing R&amp;D needs and inviting proposals from small companies.

Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns (SBC).

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the SBC's Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
In Phase III the ultimate goal of the SBIR program is to grow small businesses and meet war-fighter requirements.  Phase III contracts are awarded to those efforts that were ready to be commercialized or integrated into a Program of Record (POR).  The DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000 in order to track the success of the SBIR program.  The Navy generally awards more Phase III contracts than the rest of the DOD combined.  Although no government SBIR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's SBIR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community and our Naval warfighters.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $1,000,000,000 to set aside 0.45% for STTR in FY 2016.  This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions.  The program goals are to create vehicles from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Phase I Feasibility:
Phase I awards determined the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of the proposed effort and quality of
performance by the small business concerns.

Phase II Technology Development:
Phase II awards are based on the small business concerns Phase I results and potential of the Phase II proposal to address the Navy's needs.  These awards further developed the technology, maturing the Technology Readiness Level and providing prototypes or other sources validating the technology.

Phase III Commercialization:
Phase III - Since the DOD started tracking DOD Phase III contract awards in 2000, the Navy continues annually to award
more in Phase III contracts then the rest of the DOD combined and continues to be called out in studies and Congressional language as the premier DOD STTR program.  Although no government STTR funds are involved, phase III funding can come from the government and/or private sector.  The target is to transition a company's STTR effort into products, tools or services that benefit the Navy acquisition community.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.

Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plans: This project supports the Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation, Navy (RDTEN) portion of the larger DoD and Navy-wide effort to implement the financial improvement plan.  Funding is for the sustainment of clean and auditable statements for RDTEN.

Operations Integration Group:  Classified

CHENG: Develops and implements architecture-based systems engineering processes, methods and tools that assure integrated and interoperable systems are delivered to the fleet.  This project provides the mission-oriented technical basis for implementing capability-based acquisition management within the Navy to engineer and field Navy and Marine Corps combat systems, weapon systems, and command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) programs that must operate as  family-of-systems (FoS) or system-of-systems (SoS).  The focus of this project is on identifying the functions, relationships, and connections between systems at both the force and unit level and across warfare mission areas, and encompasses three key elements:  Systems Engineering to provide the framework for making engineering decisions by war fighting capability at the FoS/SoS level and supports consistent engineering and investment decision-making across Navy and Marine Corps programs within capability-based acquisition portfolios.  Naval Collaborative Engineering Environment development and implementation as a DON enterprise resource for Naval integration and interoperability information to enable collaboration and decision support among Fleet organizations, Program Executive Offices, Program Managers, Systems Commands, prime contractors, Resource/Warfare Sponsors and Comptroller organizations.  Standards, Policies and Guidelines engineering and technical staff to implement DoN, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint integration and interoperability and Anti-Tamper initiatives.

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.

MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:

This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations. Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States). This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations. This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats.

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1) Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2) Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3) Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4) Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5) Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6) Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7) Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The project scope supports the strategic shift to the Pacific Region with emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and Coalition Interoperability.  Relationships have been, and are being initiated with a greatly expanded and diverse group of maritime countries, particularly those with nascent and littoral navies.  The project was restructured internally to both maintain ongoing international relationships and projects, while preparing to facilitate support for a global network of maritime nations under MDA and Coalition Interoperability requirements. 

Ongoing cooperative RDT&amp;E programs, projects and exchanges are pursued to identify cooperative acquisition programs, enhance OCO efforts and MDA development, fill capability gaps, improve US/coalition interoperability, and set standardization with international partners. Such efforts have resulted in:
1. Negotiating and developing approximately 57 international RDT&amp;E Agreements annually with allied and friendly nations;
2. Executing approximately 300 Information Exchange Annexes (IEAs) with foreign partners;
3. Improving IEA information dissemination with allied and friendly countries and within Department of the Navy (DoN);
4. Coordinating Navy inputs to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&amp;L) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Program, and Coalition Warfare Program (CWT) as well as the DoN Technology Transfer Security Assistance Review Boards (TTSARB). 
5. Represent the US Navy in Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed Armaments Cooperation Forums, including the Conference of NATO Armaments Directors' groups {NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG)}, and Senior National Representative-Maritime (SNR-M);
6.  Funding of various international RDT&amp;E support databases including Technical Project Officer (TPO), International Agreement Generators, Information/Data Exchange Agreements, and Project Agreements/Memorandums of Understanding;
7.  Leading the Engineering and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Navy Postgraduate School (NPS) research and analysis activities serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic, tactical and operational thought within the Navy communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, tactical imperatives, quantitative analyses, technical developments and assessments, and political-military assessments.  Also, provide recommendations to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Fleet Commanders and numbered Fleet Commanders regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options for the President of the United States.  Research will be conducted that will enhance graduate education for Naval Officers and potentially provide students with areas of studies for theses and faculty projects. These research activities also serve as a means for OPNAV Resource Sponsors and Major Commands to have analysis and decision support research conducted in the uses of the applied, soft, and hard sciences in solving diverse and complex resource allocation and strategic issues facing the Navy today and envisioned in the future.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (Information Warfare); warfare systems (Expeditionary Warfare &amp; Combat Logistics, Sea Control, and Power Projection) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

Beginning in FY 2014, this project also includes funding for Concept Formulation (CONFORM)  / Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) efforts.  This is a shift of funding from PE 0605152N, Studies and Analysis Support, Project 2092, Naval Warfare Studies.  CONFORM/CDE for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  
-	The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class.
-	This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria.
-	Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The overall goal is to conduct analysis to support the Navy decisions needed to turn strategy and guidance into the Fleet capabilities we need within acceptable risk. METRIC:  Risks are balanced across capability that delivers the right capabilities within the resources available to Navy.  Navy Assessment Program supports the development of platform specific studies and Capabilities Based Assessments, an analytical effort resulting in Functional Area Analysis, Functional Needs Analysis, and Functional Solution Analysis.  Efforts provide added analytical rigor relative to program's maturation under the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and support warfare integration initiatives. 

-Navy Standard Scenarios with Warfare and Warfare Support Analyses: Goal: To ensure that essential elements of warfare analyses, including scenarios, operational concepts, tactics, capabilities of platforms and systems (for Navy, Joint, coalition and threat forces), key assumptions and input data are defined and traceable to government approved source material. METRIC: Consistency with other ongoing analyses as directed, develop Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness and recommend appropriate modeling/methodology to support analysis. Models/methodology used reflect study objects, level of fidelity required and time constraints. 

-Capability Based Assessments with Campaign Mission Analyses Analytical and Technical Support: Goal: To provide analyses and technical and engineering support including, but not limited to, joint campaign analysis that examines the ability to counter a range of coordinated threat capabilities, high level tradeoffs between service capabilities, or impact of large-scale architecture, force structure of modernization decision; mission-level effectiveness analyses to determine system capabilities; analyses of alternative force structures to determine ability to meet peacetime deployment or steady-state requirements and respond to transition to war and contingency operations; cost-effectiveness and analyses; Acquisition Category Program Office and Systems Command assessments; and analyses of new technologies. METRIC: Develop analysis plans; determine proposed alternatives for analysis; and research performance data on current and future threats, coalition and own force systems; perform technology investigations and forecasts; develop or obtain cost data for current or planned systems; develop and use Cost Estimating Relationships to determine cost for conceptual or future systems for which no cost data is available; identify analysis assumptions, limitations and uncertainties; use established models or develop new models or methodologies to perform analyses; and interpret and analyze results. 

-Campaign Analysis-Modeling and Simulation: Goal: Develop and maintain a standard set of models for use in warfare analyses and analyses performed to support Planning Strategy that work at the campaign, mission, and engagement levels. METRIC: A combination of model design statements, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model/database documents, model verification and validation plans, code, and Plan of Action and Milestones reports developed or updated that encompass all aspects of Sea Power 21 to include at a minimum air, land, sea, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.

-Joint Assessments and Integration and Investment Strategy Development: Goal: Conduct assessments to determine shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned operational or support capabilities; identify key issues including deficiencies in warfighting capability; determine priorities for needed capabilities; assesses affordability of high payoff systems and technologies; assess effectiveness and affordability of alternative force structures; and formulate investment strategies. Continue development and refinement of Navy program planning to determine the warfighting wholeness and cost effectiveness of alternative Navy strategies. METRIC: Identify shortfalls and redundancies in existing or planned capabilities. Determine the impact of variations in warfare systems and architectures in threat, U.S. and combined forces and strategies. Provide engineering and analytic support for the assessment and transition of technology for use in the Investment Strategy. 

-World Class Modeling, Simulation, and Capability Analysis: Goal: Development of new models or model upgrades to meet requirements identified by the WCM requirements process that support the Program Objective Memorandum decision-making process, with the goal of creating a state-of-the art set of models for use in warfare and warfare support analyses. METRIC: Develop model design documents, model study reports, system specifications, updated model reports, model documentation, model verification and validation plans, code, Plan of Action and Milestones reports, and technical reports.
The May 2007 revision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) instruction (CJCSI 3170.01F) requires a CBA to assess new requirements. A CBA instruction has been developed by the Chief Navy Office's warfare integration office that prescribes a procedure and structure to this warfighting requirements generation process (JCIDS). A CBA is required to address and validate capability shortfalls or gaps as defined by combatant commanders. It is an analytical process that includes three phases: the Functional Area Analysis, the Functional Needs Analysis, and the Functional Solution Analysis. This process is designed to address future warfighting requirements and analysis needs and improve the quality of Analysis of Alternatives. CBA supports Navy programming decisions and provides the means to develop the analytic underpinning to support the determination of Naval capabilities and force structure recapitalization investments required to fulfill the Maritime Strategy.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

Additionally, the transferred budget authority will be used to provide in-depth/cross-cutting analysis to the Mission Assurance (MA)/DCIP programs at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Military Departments/Services, Defense Sector Lead Agencies (DSLAs), and Combatant Commands. NSWC-MAD will also perform cyber mission assurance research and provide expertise in infrastructure mitigation techniques.

For the performance period, A40 will support the Joint Mission Assurance Assessment (JMAA) assessments as well as other critical infrastructure assessments based on OASD HD priorities. These on-site assessments of DCI are required to meet annual policy requirements and to ensure assets nominated as Defense Critical Asset (DCA) are fully vetted and validated. Assessment teams will normally consist of a mission analyst and four infrastructure analysts, but team composition may be modified based on the site and assessment requirements. The assessments include pre-site work, on-site work, and post-site report writing. The final assessment report will include collected research such as Baseline Elements of Information (BEI), Benchmarks and Standards, characterizing infrastructure / identifying vulnerabilities to missions, and completing the vulnerability portion of the Risk Decision Package. A40 will work with other service and agency teams to supplement data evaluation for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) offices as negotiated between OASD HD's MA Director, the Joint Staff J34 and Service CIP offices</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>A40 Cyber Warfare Engineering Division, CWED, will serve as a centralized analytical arm and fusion center for DoD-owned infrastructure information and also for worldwide commercial and host nation owned infrastructure that DoD depends upon for MA. They will provide actionable analytic products and share infrastructure information with DCIP stakeholders and MA partners to meet requirements identified in Policy. They will continue to work with OASD HD to refine and mature the Critical Asset Identification Process (CAIP), including working with DCIP community members to document suggested improvements and identify interdependency trends and remediation opportunities. They will work with CCMDs, Services, Sectors, and Agencies to conduct deep-dive infrastructure research and develop web services to transfer data between DCIP Systems. A40 will provide reach back desktop analysis support of regions and/or specific countries across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs), with focus in U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), and U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AORs in the upcoming period. 

In addition, A40 will provide analytical and on-site assistance, as required, to look at the defense continuity aspects of MA. Additional tasks can include on-site analysis based on OASD HD and CCMD prioritization of needs / requirements. Tasks can range between full infrastructure analysis across particular countries for operational planning, to specific infrastructure analysis involving telecommunication assets, the Global Information Grid (GIG), and electric power infrastructure security. A40 will assist Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Policy, Acquisition Technology and Logistics Installations and Environment (AT&amp;L I&amp;E) and AT&amp;L Operational Energy in developing and refining Energy Security documents, presentations, plans, and procedures, and refining lists of potential mitigation options for energy-related vulnerabilities. They will serve as an integrating function by providing a source for historical and ongoing DCIP analysis information / assessment research data and feedback, geospatial information, and threat and hazard mapping. They will update and revise MA benchmark standards in conjunction with Joint Staff, Defense Thread Reduction Agency (DTRA), and selected assessment service teams. They will continue to update the DCIP benchmarks and standards data / information to support MA program execution requirements.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>A40 Cyber Warfare Engineering Division, CWED, will provide deep dive technical analysis on critical infrastructure issues related to specific crises affecting DoD missions and Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) response efforts. They will develop inputs and provide the Global Situational Awareness Facility (GSAF) / National Military Command Center (NMCC) / Joint Staff J33 personnel and senior leaders with actionable analytic products and value-added strategic risk management recommendations for critical decision making during events. They will provide quick response infrastructure research and analysis to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security (OASD(HD&amp;GS)), CCMDs, Services, Sectors, and Agencies in the form of technical analysis and recommendations to the OASD (HD&amp;GS) and the DCIP Community on infrastructure networks and points of service related to pre-event and post-event analysis for manmade or natural disaster incidents and intelligence relating to threats. The crisis response / preparation of infrastructure analysis to the DCIP Community will also be utilized during planned exercises.
Through this support, A40s infrastructure analysis will help identify the potential crisis impact and will support risk management recommendations during and after the exercises. They will support emergent requirements for DoD and National initiatives at the direction of the OASD (HD&amp;GS). This support may include infrastructure research and subject matter expertise (SME) analysis, participation in DoD or interagency working groups, and infrastructure-related inquiries by congress. They will identify emerging threat vectors and CIP-related gaps in coordination with CCMDs and DoD agencies related to MA and Critical Infrastructure Sectors, and their impacts via white papers and briefings. U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) submissions and on-site liaisons provided per request and approval; participation in USNORTHCOM outreach sessions is anticipated as part of this tasking.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Standards, Policy, and Guidelines: - Alignment of SPGs across the Naval Enterprise and with OSD and Joint organizations will support standard acquisition implementation and improve compatibility and interoperability thereby lowering development and maintenance costs across programs												
- Aggregating systems for the purpose of conducting certification and accreditation and consolidating mandatory documentation for aggregations versus individual systems will optimize (cost tradeoffs and focus on high priority issues) certifications, reduce paperwork and associated costs, and put attention on systems engineering, IA, and ISPs for systems in their aggregated operational state vice just the individual system development state.   Document costs for major programs are $1 to $3.5 Million per system.  An aggregation may include 15 or more systems with four or more being major systems.  Aggregation presents a high potential for Return on Investment.												
- NR-KPP processes will clarify requirements and capabilities (including their metrics) that acquisition programs need to develop systems.  This clarification will eliminate guesses in terms of operational needs, thereby reducing the risk of program failure and reducing program and life-cycle costs.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations.  Included is participation in the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009).  Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of ten participating nations (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in several Project Arrangements and includes maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations.  Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.

The MTMD forum provides protection against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the creation of an interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps.
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.

Starting in FY17, funding for MTMD is realigned from Program Element 0603582N Combat System Integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Critical Science and Technology research cannot be sustained or succeed in deteriorated facilities.  World class research can only be accomplished in facilities that are at a minimum "adequate", but preferably "state-of-the-art."  Due to their advanced age and deterioration, funds are planned to restore/modernize various laboratory facilities at the Naval Research Laboratory.  

The FY17 and FY18 funding increases will support the restoration/modernization of Naval Research Laboratory, the Navy's world class corporate research laboratory, to ensure they can meet future technological threats.  Due to advanced age and deterioration of the facilities, the increase in funding is needed to update various laboratory facilities to further the critical science and technology research for the Navy.</r2:Description>

The funds will be used for specific studies, evaluations, and the special handling of highly critical and sensitive laboratories that will be relocated into refurbished buildings. This includes planning, consolidating and relocating of over 100 laboratories into less than 80 laboratories; careful disassembly of one-of-a-kind facilities and equipment by in-house scientists and experts and contractor support with specialized skills to devise unique plans to disassemble, transport, and reassemble the facilities; and the recalibration and specialized reassembly of the highly specialized equipment (e.g., solid-state electronic devises, lasers, vacuum tubes, electrical connections, reactors, gas sensors and chambers, and chemical connectors and distribution systems).</r2:Text>

Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on OE sub Line of Effort (LOE) with at least 80% of initial objectives being met after proof of concept test run in late FY17; successfully implement quarterly OE events beginning 1QTR FY18

This PE provides funding to support continuing requirement for extensive studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). This PE directly supports the China Strategic Initiative's (CSI) Strategic Emulations LOE, expanding those outputs to the operational level, making insights timely and relevant to USPACOM (and other Combatant Commands), Functional Component Force Commanders across all strategic domains (e.g. cyber, air and space, sea etc.) in support of national-level mandated operational and strategic-level contingency planning.  

Operational Decision Analysis (ODA). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on ODA sub Line of Effort support effort with at least 80% of initial objectives being achieved by 3QTR FY18.

This PE provides funding to support continuing requirement for studies and analysis of issues critical to operational and intelligence contingency planning required by the China Strategic Roundtable (whose members include all Combatant Commanders, Service Chiefs, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Policy leadership, the Director of Defense Intelligence Agency, and Director of the National Security Agency). The PE directly support CSI's Strategic Emulation LOE and will provide critical technical inputs and strategic insights that complement the program's OE output database, which is still under development. ODA outputs will significantly enhance Combatant Component Command staffs with their operational and intelligence planning and global synchronization across multiple domains amongst all geographic and functional combatant commands.  

Decision Support Elements to Operational Emulation Modeling and Simulation (DSEOMS). Successfully achieve Initial Operating Capability on this major LOE with at least 80% of initial objectives being met by 3QTR FY19.

This PE provides funding to support all four major LOEs for the CSI program?and all its sub-LOEs. This effort will provide a comprehensive and campaign-quality decision support toolset to decision makers across the entire CSI enterprise: OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Intelligence Community, and the Whole of US Government (Interagency). This PE will create a set of enhanced automated and doctrinal decision- making tools to assist key policy- and strategic leaders on a full spectrum of contingencies related to competitor nations. DSEOMS will provide analytic modeling and simulation tools that take inputs from all major CSI program LOEs; the goal being to present decision- and policy-makers and their planning staffs with a rich dataset of information that is relevant, timely, and substantive for their respective problem sets. The current scope and focus across all LOE's is to support emerging near-term and longer-term planning to both significantly enhance war planning orientation and force posture considerations but also to significantly enhance more informed strategic choices regarding future joint/service capability investments and joint/service operational concepts across all strategic domains.   Ultimately, fully integrated program deliverables will guide a deliberative process for identifying efficiencies in major service platform decisions to ensure they are optimized for the full-spectrum of projected adversary capabilities in the future.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds execution of DoD's Executive Agent (EA) for Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) Technologies as established by the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act (Section 256, PL 110-417).  The primary deliverable from this effort will be a PrCB and Interconnect Technology Roadmap, or strategic plan, identifying domestic technology gaps, future research and development needs, and any policy changes required to ensure that the DoD has access to PrCB manufacturing capabilities and technical expertise necessary to meet future military requirements.  As mandated, the EA will also address DoD PrCB supply chain issues, including diversity and vulnerabilities, and develop trustworthiness requirements for PrCBs used in defense systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>In 2005, the National Academies national research council (NRC) conducted a study and subsequently issued a report relating to manufacturing trends in printed circuit technology.  Within that report, the NRC detailed four critical issue areas that needed to be addressed in the interest of national security.  Those issue areas included; Trust, Supply Chain, Organic (DoD) Capability Sustainment, and Technology Development.  

Intense global competition in the Printed Circuit Board (PrCB) industry has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of United States PrCB companies, leaving the domestic PrCB industrial base "fragile" and progressively declining in capability and health.  Implementation of the strategies developed by the EA for PrCB Technologies will proactively ensure that the U.S. PrCB industry is capable of supporting future DoD electronics requirements.  The strategic plan is expected to indentify technology gaps and research and development needs, as well as identify and recommend policy changes.

In addition to benefiting DoD by ensuring access to leading edge PrCB technology, it is expected that the EA program will help the struggling domestic PrCB industry by indentifying future technology research and development needs and securing the domestic military market.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports ONR leadership, management and direction for the Naval S&amp;T program. This project funds ONR HQ Non-Management Headquarters Activities (Non-MHA) salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  In FY16 and out, the Mid-Range Financial Improvement Plan effort will be transferred into this project from PE 0605853N Project 3025 to support ONR's goal of attaining a clean and auditable financial statement. ONR sponsors scientific advances, which lead to Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), supporting the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority. Functions performed include (1) scientific and technical direction of the nationwide 6.1 basic research program with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and Naval Laboratories and Warfare Centers; (2) scientific and technical direction of the 6.2 applied research program through the Naval R&amp;D laboratories and Warfare Centers and industry; (3) scientific and technical direction of the Naval 6.3 advanced technology development program through the Navy's R&amp;D laboratories, Warfare Centers and industry; (4) management, resource formulation, program assessment, and contract negotiation/administration of the Navy basic research, applied research and advanced technology development program; and (5) coordination of the Navy's Technology Base program within the context of total DoD/Government (e.g., National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences) R&amp;D initiatives in order to maximize scientific advances. This project also supports ONR Non-MHA management and direction for the following Navy-wide programs:  Small Business Innovation Research, Naval Research Advisory Committee, Navy Patent Program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions Program, Navy Manufacturing Technology Program and the Ballistic Missile Submarine Nuclear (SSBN) Security Technology Program. 

Additionally, this project funds ONR field salaries, communications, and other fixed costs.  Functions performed support ONR's Navy-wide responsibilities in the negotiation and establishment of indirect cost rates for DoD-assigned universities and performance of contract administration for all DoD contracts/grants at all colleges and universities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>S&amp;T MANAGEMENT SUPPORT</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This project provides for Non-MHA costs of ONR Headquarters in support of the entire Navy S&amp;T program. Most all the funds in this project are fixed costs, such as salaries and communications. Specifically, it pays the salaries of Scientific and Engineering and corporate business personnel who direct the execution of the Navy's basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development programs at the nation's universities/colleges, Navy laboratories, Warfare Centers, and private industry.

This project also provides for Non-MHA costs of ONR's field activities to include fixed costs, such as salaries and communications.

Effective in FY 2017, ONR realigned costs associated with Management Headquarters Activity (MHA) salaries into PE 0605898N Management HQ - R&amp;D.  The reduction in FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects that realignment.

The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects a transfer of Non-MHA funding to PE 0602861N Science &amp; Technology Management - ONR Field Accounts to consolidate ONR Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Management in 6.2 Applied Research and improve reporting of Navy's S&amp;T investment by including S&amp;T management as part of the S&amp;T topline, offset by the transfer of funding from 0605853N Management, Technical and International Support to support Financial Auditability and Audit Readiness (FIAR).

Effective in FY18 this PE Project will only fund NGEN Corporate requirements and FIAR Civilian Salary (1 FTE).</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This continuing program provides support for ships and aircraft required to accommodate Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) of new systems. The RDT&amp;E ship and aircraft inventory is required to adequately test new and improved weapon systems, stay current with threats, and increase warfighting capability of the fleet. The program provides integrated logistics support for aircraft at selected field activities; provides depot-level rework of aircraft, engines, and components for the Navy inventory of RDT&amp;E aircraft; and provides support for ships and aircraft bailed to contractors for Navy RDT&amp;E projects. Costs covered under this element include aircrew training and proficiency, fuel, supplies, equipment, repair, Aviation Depot Level Repairables, overhaul of ships and aircraft, as well as organizational, intermediate, and depot maintenance of ships and aircraft in the Navy RDT&amp;E inventory.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Support. This continuing project funds costs associated with RDT&amp;E fixed and rotary wing aircraft which accommodate test and evaluation of aircraft/weapon systems. Testing aboard these platforms reduces the number of fleet units required to support RDT&amp;E efforts.  Included in these costs are Aviation Depot-Level Repairables (AVDLR), which are spare and replacement aircraft parts and components to support overhead maintenance related flight operations, aircrew training, and proficiency flight hours. This project also funds airframe Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM), the Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) and Phased Depot Maintenance (PDM), in-service repairs, emergency repairs, and engine repairs, as well as aircraft material condition and field inspections. Additionally, it funds Aircraft Structure Periodic Adjustments (ASPA), Individual Material Readiness List (IMRL) tools and support equipment, Aviation Climate Assessment Survey System (ACASS) and other systems for application to and compatibility with RDT&amp;E requirements.

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T&amp;E Enterprise consolidates all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with LHD 8, LSD 50, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) versions 7 and 8. This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for Extended Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.

Enterprise Cost elements:
a) SDTS Acquisition includes the direct procurement costs of major Combat Systems (CS) elements which will be installed on the SDTS.

b) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.

c) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, DDG 1000, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.

d) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LHA 6, LSD 50, LCS 7, LCS 8 and CVN 78.

e) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).

f) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Information Assurance (IA) certifications, and financial management.

g) Maintenance of CS includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&amp;E Enterprise preserves end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) data validated with results of that Operational Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.

This program provides institutional maintenance and operations support for: the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Detachment Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), Andros Island, Bahamas; the Environmental Compliance Program; Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu and China Lake, CA; Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD; Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) related capabilities at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Barking Sands, HI; Maintenance and Repair at NAWCWD, NAWCAD, and AUTEC; and the NUWC Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges. Project Unit 3386, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Marine Vessels, is a new start FY17 program which will provide the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 MRTFB marine vessels located at NAWCWD, Point Mugu, CA, PMRF, Honolulu, HI, NUWC Keyport Nanoose and Dabob Bay Ranges, Keyport, WA, NAWCAD, Patuxent River, MD, and NUWC Detachment (AUTEC).  The T&amp;E activities make up the Navy portion of the Department of Defense's MRTFB. These activities are chartered to perform T&amp;E for the development and acquisition of technology advanced weapons systems. Core T&amp;E capabilities and capacity are operated to obtain weapons system performance documentation for acquisition program milestone decisions to provide operational forces with effective weapons systems. This program provides Navy Acquisition Program Managers required test capabilities; lowers cost of T&amp;E; removes cost and scheduling impact of providing their own T&amp;E resources; and retains the physical airspace, land space and sea space needed to conduct testing.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The AUTEC Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  AUTEC's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  AUTEC aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

AUTEC manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA), a Mark 30 undersea target IMA, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

AUTEC has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the AUTEC helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface targets, test instrumentation, and T&amp;E aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its T&amp;E mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range (ECR), which provides outdoor free space development and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facility; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is a new start FY17 program which funds the overhauls and preventative maintenance of the 23 Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) marine vessels located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu, CA, Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Honolulu, HI, Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Keyport, WA, Naval Air Warfare Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, and Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC). These vessels are used to launch and recover torpedoes, acoustic systems, and other weapons, provide range surveillance and clearance, and can be configured as a target.  Overhauls are required to operate ships over 300 tons overseas in compliance with American Bureau of Shipping "Load Line" certification requirements.  Major preventative maintenance requiring shipyard support is also performed during these periods to mitigate risks of failures.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Fleet demand for Cybersecurity testing has increased by 63% since FY14 due to real world threats and Department  of Defense (DoD) directives.  Cyber Security threats continue to evolve and it has become more challenging for the Navy to protect systems, detect threats, react to threatens and restore system functionality after a cyber attack.  These evolving threats require specialized training, tool sets and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.  The funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD.

The cyber manpower increase is offset by the realignment of 14 Management Headquarters Activity (MHA) FTE from this program element into 0902498N Management Headquarters (Departmental Support Accounts).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating costs and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives to conduct independent operational testing and evaluation. This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness and suitability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop "minimum, adequate" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>As indicated in section A above, funding provides for core headquarters operations and support (O&amp;S) costs related to required operational testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) conducted in support of Navy acquisition programs. The preponderance of funding provides for the annual O&amp;S costs for day to day operations of the staff/headquarters of COMOPTEVFOR, located in Norfolk, Virginia. (Pursuant to DoD Financial Management Regulations and Navy financial policy guidance, as a T&amp;E activity, COMOPTEVFOR's annual support costs are funded via RDTEN vice OMN; hence, and unlike most RDTEN programs, these funds provide for O&amp;S costs typical of military field commands/activities). Within this project, over 1/2 of the funding supports salaries of assigned civilian personnel. The remaining funds provide for other routine support costs such as travel, IT support, supplies, and other overhead/administrative support costs. The primary metric used within the project involves support for scheduled Navy acquisition program testing and subsequent analysis and reporting of results of testing to appropriate senior Navy acquisition officials and to the Navy chain of command directly to the CNO and various OPNAV/SECNAV staff offices. The performance goal is met when all assigned/scheduled testing and reporting is supported each year. Specific test program success is measured through analytic results of testing conducted throughout the year and constant interaction with program offices, acquisition decision makers, OPNAV staff resource sponsor offices, OSD and other service T&amp;E offices/activities, and miscellaneous other customers/stakeholders. This project also supports testing and evaluation of various Joint/multi-service programs in which the Navy shares responsibilities in support of the acquisition community. The following metrics relate directly to the funding provided and are applicable to current operations.                            
                              
Number of Tests Conducted - FY16 = 103; FY17 = 104; FY18 = 108
Number of Programs Supported - FY16 = 422; FY17 = 424; FY18 = 424</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency (RF) Management Program. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms. 

(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations.  It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.

(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program.  The program investigates Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental effects between shipboard transmitters/receivers and develops EM and spectrum techniques with Commercial off the shelf (COTS)  technologies to provide the ability to monitor EM spectrum usage and system EM degradation on all ships in a given strike group.  The program will investigate technologies to build an EM Spectrum Common Operational Picture (COP) to detect and assess operational capabilities in real-time.  Additional investigations will be performed to develop processes and procedures to predict the EM environment for planning purposes.  In the out-years, these capabilities will be used to build the next generation combat system with inherent spectrum agility and self-awareness capability, further enhancing the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF). 

(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development. Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC), has established Operations Analysis Directorate (OAD), as the sole operations research, analytic support, and studies management program for the Marine Corps Study System (MCSS). OAD provides Senior Military Leadership with a comprehensive understanding of operations and advanced analytic and statistical support. In compliance with Executive Order #13589 OAD's major focus is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations. Division analysts are credited with innovations in analysis of amphibious operations and Irregular Warfare (IW) that have expanded state-of-the-art operations research methods across DOD. OAD quantifies resource allocation decisions pertaining to weapon systems, strategic personnel, training management, and equipment acquisition. Efforts are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan and Planning Guidance. 

Future studies support Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF's) and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU's) with research analysis and modeling and simulation focused on aviation, amphibious, and ground operations enhancing the ability of the Marine Corps to increase operational, logistical and equipment efficiencies and capabilities and provide a unique, well trained, equipped and educated force.  

This program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM.  (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CAB) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Through the MCSS, the Marine Corps nominates, approves, commences, manages and distributes the resultant analytical products. Efforts are evaluated and selected by the Studies Requirements Review Board (SRRB) and approved by the CG, Combat Development and Integration (CD&amp;I)and is targeted to a particular audience that understands current and future USMC mission requirements and the need for comprehensive analyses that meets the Commandant's Strategic Goals, supports and  protects forces in theater, and utilizes funds efficiently.  Research conducted produces comprehensive and integrated analyses aligned to Senior Leadership's requirements and decision timelines.

The decrease from FY17 to FY18 of $1.743M reflects an adjustment of funding back to normal operational levels. FY17 funding supported a significant increase in studies, operations research and analyses, and modeling and simulation to support the Commandant's Planning Guidance (CPG), Defense Planning Guidance, Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Chairman's Joint Force Assessment, Chairman's Strategic Seminar Series Wargames, Annual Joint Staff Force Sufficiency Assessments, and POTUS.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM). Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) systems are adopted if they meet the CM mission requirements. FIRS Research &amp; Development effort allows the program to keep abreast of emerging technologies in the commercial sector and address operational capability gaps that cannot be met by commercial items.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Through this support, the S&amp;T enterprise pursues the technological advances that enable the Fleet's ability to operate from a position of technological superiority.

The increase in funding from FY 2016 to FY 2017 reflects a transfer of MHA civilian salaries from PE 0605861N Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Science and Technology Management as directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Deputy of Chief Management Officer (DCMO) and other leadership to ensure consistent external reporting. All Non-Operational HQ is now Major Headquarters Activity (MHA).

The increase in funding from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects a transfer of ONR Non-Labor MHA support for the Navy S&amp;T programs from PE 0602898N Science and Technology Management - ONR Headquarters. Specifically, funding facilitates the execution of the Navy's basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development programs at the nation's universities/colleges, Navy laboratories, Warfare Centers, and private industry.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program examines the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to identified warfighter capability gaps within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The FLEX program considers warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC); USFF/CPF's Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL) delivered annually to the CNO; USFF/CPF's Commanders' FLEX Guidance; and Navy and Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statements. In addition, FLEX addresses innovative concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and Fleet Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) that collectively mitigate Fleet-identified warfighting capability gaps as defined by annual FLEX guidance. Through experimentation activities such as workshops, system or seminar war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel tangible solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products to the fleet. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&amp;T), academia, and industry partners.

	Experimentation is vital to continuously improving naval warfighting capabilities. As such, the FLEX program directly supports four of the five elements outlined in the Secretary of the Navy's Innovation Vision: Build the Naval Innovation Network, Improve the Use of DON Information, Accelerate Emerging Operational Capabilities to the Fleet, and Develop Game-Changing Warfighting Concepts.

Expeditionary SFOC Communications (Classified Project) will transfer from Project 3319 (FLEX) to Project 3420 (Expeditionary SFOC Communications) in FY18.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>FLEX is a USFF/CPF collaborative effort to address fleet prioritized capability gaps, led by USFF N8/N9, supported by Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC), and coordinated with Naval Component Commands (NCC)/Numbered Fleets, Type Commanders (TYCOM), Systems Commands (SYSCOM), OPNAV, Services, Coalition, and Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) community.  The Fleet Experimentation program objective is to produce recommended changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership development, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions. Deliverables are focused on operational and tactical warfighting capability in the near term (within the Future Years Defense Program), and prioritized by the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces (USFF)/Commander, Pacific Fleet (CPF) Fleet Experimentation annual guidance. NWDC plans and executes USFF/CPF approved multi-year Fleet experimentation campaigns and final reports.  USFF/CPF staff manage the follow-on DOTMLPF-P actions with OPNAV, SYSCOMs, TYCOMs and Warfighter Development Center (WDC) staffs to establish or enhance warfighting capability in Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Surface Warfare (SUW), Strike Warfare (STW), Anti-Submarine Warfare(ASW),Expeditionary Warfare (EXW), Information Dominance (ID), Mine Warfare (MIW) and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP).
 
FLEX supports Operational/Tactical venues to experiment, demonstrate, assess warfighting CONOPS development, concepts, doctrine/training development, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and technologies 
	Multi-year experiment campaigns focus on warfighting capability per CPF/CUSFFC guidance to evaluate and transition to DOTMLPF-Policy change recommendations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Expeditionary Submarine Fiber Optic Cable (SFOC) Communications project is a classified program responsible for  developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both material and non-material methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.  The project focus is to demonstrate capabilities that leverage existing DOD investments and infrastructure using non-traditional means to move data and information.  The key deliverable will be a demonstration using maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture to validate C2 data movement in the maritime domain.  Continue the development and refinement of advanced networking and communication capabilities in a maritime environment that promote C2 interoperability in Satellite Communications (SATCOM) - Restricted and SATCOM - Denied environments, and support the defeat Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD).  Solutions will address higher bandwidth technologies across the Radio Frequency (RF) and Optical spectrum.

This is not a new start. $7.54M of funding was transferred from project 3319 FLEX and moved to 3420 Expeditionary Submarine Fiber Optic Cable (SFOC) Communications for transparency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to: 1) Exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) Understand the disposition of friendly forces; 3) Target and conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) Assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

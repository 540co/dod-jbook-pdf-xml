                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supporting basic research provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.  

The Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative, and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (Vannevar Bush), formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research Initiatives project code, P010, includes Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) and the Minerva Research Initiative.

SSBR supports oversight, policies, and initiatives to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering's (ASD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department. SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with academic research community and international partners. 

The Minerva Research Initiative, a department-wide basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and executed by the Services, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation’s only social science basic research programs in support of national security (especially funding field research).  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Through these workshops, National research leaders convened to provide expert perspectives on potential breakthroughs and barriers of advancement in rapidly evolving fields of basic research, and have informed MURI topic priorities and Vannevar Bush research solicitation areas.

With the goals of reinvigorating DoD laboratories as facilities of basic research and enhancing connectivity between the academic and defense laboratory communities, the Department launched the “Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative” (LUCI) pilot, augmenting the Vannevar Bush Program, an ASD(R&amp;E) Program.  There were 16 collaborative research projects conducted between DoD researchers and Vannevar Bush Fellows in areas of scientific or technological importance to DoD, while also expanding the research capabilities of DoD laboratories.  Additionally, the I-Corps Pilot Program aimed at accelerating commercialization of basic research innovations was successfully launched, with one team selected for support, and five additional teams in the queue.  Modeled after the National Science Foundation's I-Corps program, the DoD program facilitates collaboration between academia and industry to spur the transition of defense innovations of interest into emerging products and services.  Those emerging products and services have the potential for commercialization into industry or transition into DoD programs of record.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) ensures the Department of Defense (DoD) will have access to high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the STEM Development Office, under the Defense Laboratories Office within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)).  NDEP’s portfolio includes the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program, the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP), STEM Education and Outreach, and STEM Operations.  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation’s talent pool by improving the capacity to address ever-changing future Defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through public communications and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges. 

NDEP aligns to the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities.  It is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

The SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 19 STEM academic disciplines and transitions graduates directly into DoD's workforce following graduation.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for broadly relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,000 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 1,350 have completed program studies and approximately 1,100 are currently employed in the DoD workforce.  SMART ensures that DoD has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

STEM Education and Outreach fosters conditions for activities to support and cultivate STEM talent to build a future force that is representative of the nation’s diverse population and to reach underserved populations to meet national defense needs and future defense challenges.  Initiatives include investing, promoting and participating in national-level STEM programs and initiatives, and providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the nation.

STEM Operations manages activities to implement the Department’s strategic plan for STEM education and outreach.  STEM Operations provides program management and oversight, research studies, and official responses to Congressional and non-Congressional inquiries.  STEM Operations develops and maintains systems and standards to support STEM policy implementation, oversight, and assessment.  Other STEM Operations activities include providing support to STEM education and outreach programs, implementing the Communications Plan, and collaborating across the federal government and public domain through interagency and intradepartmental working groups and partnerships.

The MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the armed forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, directed the Secretary of the Defense to establish this Pilot Program.  The MCPP will continue to receive support through FY 2020 in accordance with legislative direction.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 19 academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce needed by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas.  The disciplines include: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to DoD on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  A total of 800 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD commitment; 75 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs, and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research, and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.

Since FY 2005, approximately 2,000 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 160 sponsoring facilities.  As of August 2016, approximately 1,350 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer intern programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment for research and education program enhancements to essential research instruments, such as lasers and spectrometers.

•  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding.  The objective is to assist the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The competition resulted in 75 equipment grant awards totaling $28.500 million.  Recipients included: 29 HBCUs, one Tribal College, and 45 in other categories of MIs.  Initiated a special leadership project with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) under which TMCF, a non-profit organization, assists in the selection of HBCU/MI students for scholarships and internships in pursuit of STEM careers.  Under the newly established Centers of Excellence (COEs) in support of the ASD(R&amp;E) Science and Technology priorities in the areas of Cyber Security, Research Data Analysis, and Autonomy, supported 12 students in the summer of 2016 at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, NY.  Under the TMCF and the COEs, increased the number of FY 2016 summer interns from 79 (in FY 2015) to 85 participants in the DoD laboratories.  The students received stipends for participating in the research at the DoD laboratories.  Established an OSD and Department of the Navy (DoN) Cyber Security Information Assurance Program Partnership, which provided internship/co-op opportunities for four HBCU/MI students in the area of information assurance/cyber security.  Conducted two outreach webinars to expose HBCUs/MIs to opportunities in DoD totaling $0.230 million.  Nearly 250 individuals representing over 50 HBCUs/MIs attended the webinars.  Co-hosted two technical workshops (October 2015 and January 2016) with the Office of Naval Research in which representatives from seven local HBCUs and three other institutions of higher education participated.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives, and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP), 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP), 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (BFW), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (AAW), and 5) Gun Propulsion (GP).  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be developed and tested at the small-scale, and for eventual incorporation in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility. 

The Enabling Fuze Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop fuzing technologies and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs and/or design tools and protocols for weapon fuzing.  In this way, the Service and Industrial base weapon and fuze communities will be able to heavily leverage and apply these emerging and promising technologies in fuzing modeling and simulation tools, multi-point initiation, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and fuze sensor. 

The Joint Fuze Technology Program investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by Department's strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and will be validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  The capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims to develop the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with statutory requirements (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and 5000.02, and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the Program Executive Officers (PEOs), thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technology, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>HPP focuses on the development of technologies to improve the IM response of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2018 and 2023 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force (GDF), the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.

Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department's strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  The four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program will fund the development of novel leading-edge technologies emerging from high-tech companies that are not traditional defense contractors.  These funds will enable the Department to source break through and emerging technologies applicable to the defense mission as identified in the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), or the Components, for potential incorporation into the Department’s weapon systems and operational capabilities.

An objective of this program is to obtain innovative ideas from industry that have low technology readiness of high priority to DoD leadership.  Incoming proposals will be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering to ensure alignment with the DoD’s strategic objectives and increase our permeability to disruptive change, and strengthen our nation’s security.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research line program is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The LL Program supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL Program funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components and materials in support of DoD missions. Funding is applied to support high-risk, high-payoff research that provides unique and specialized capabilities to the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The LL P534 Program funds ten technology project areas. Of these, there are five core-technology areas:
•	Advanced Devices
•	Optical Systems and Technology
•	Information, Computation and Exploitation
•	Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology
•	Cyber Security
In addition, there are four emerging-technology initiatives:
•	Novel and Engineered Materials
•	Quantum System Sciences
•	Biomedical Sciences and Technology
•	Autonomous Systems
In FY 2017, an Integrated Systems initiative has been added. This area focuses on combining novel technologies from Lincoln Laboratory’s research and development efforts (as well as from commercial and academic R&amp;D) with Lincoln Laboratory’s system architecture and system engineering expertise to create breakthrough system-level designs and prototypes. 

The ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all the Department of Defense (DoD) mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. In general, the categories are selected in consultation with ASD(R&amp;E) and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The new initiatives are chosen to address difficult emerging problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with a goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally. 


Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts entitled Technical Intelligence:
-  The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context in order to assist Defense decision-makers plan for an uncertain future.  The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future.  The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

• Novel and Engineered Materials emphasizes research in new materials for additive manufacturing and emerging nanoscale materials. Projects include research in RF materials for 3D printing; other advanced 3D printing technologies; revolutionary semiconductor materials; and microsystems using metamaterials.
• Quantum System Sciences focuses on the development of quantum-based technologies that support sensing, communication, computation, and algorithms using quantum information. The projects include the demonstration of scalable computation platforms, demonstration of quantum protected communications and magnetic field sensing using highly-compact, atomic-like defects in diamond, prototyping revolutionary quantum networking systems and technology, and research into advanced quantum algorithms.
• Biomedical Sciences and Technology supports the development of bio-engineered and biomedical technologies to aid the warfighter. Projects include brain imaging technologies; relevant research in brain and cognitive sciences; engineered biological systems to aid physiology understanding; and technologies to assess physical performance and enhance injury recovery. 
• Autonomous Systems has the objective of developing mobile, autonomous, robotic platforms, as well as sensors and algorithms that support key capabilities needed for a wide range of DoD applications. Projects span advanced artificial intelligence and processing; sensors and communications for unmanned platforms; platform designs and energy systems; human-machine interactions; and verification and validation of autonomous systems.

One system technology initiative:
• Integrated Systems uses multiple new technologies to solve an important national need. Systems selected for funding have an applied research component related to the integration process. Projects target key DoD warfare domains, including space, air, land, sea surface, and undersea. This is a new area in FY 2017, and currently projects addressing the space (3D Ladar for small satellites), land (cloud-assisted tactical computing), and undersea (maritime laser-communications) are underway.  There are plans to initiate projects for the air (autonomous micro-air vehicles) and sea (unmanned surface vehicles) domains in FY 2018 and FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The continuing digital charge-coupled device (CCD) imager project constructed and demonstrated two cameras that incorporated the new imager technology fabricated in the Lincoln Laboratory Microelectronics Laboratory (ML). One of the cameras included a novel low-noise readout circuit and the other camera incorporated the hybrid integration of a CCD and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to enable kilohertz readout rates. Development also continued on germanium (Ge) CCD imagers that can offer broadband visible and short-wave infrared imaging, as well as sensitivity for higher-energy x-rays relative to silicon-based detectors. In FY 2016, the germanium CCD fabrication process was transferred to the 200-mm toolset available in the ML and prototype imagers were designed and fabricated. A new advanced-imager project involved the development of pixel-to-pixel crosstalk reduction techniques for compound-semiconductor Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (GmAPD) arrays. These techniques enable the reduction of the pixel pitch to enable GmAPD arrays having larger formats. Work continued on the development of a low size, weight and power (SWaP) optical communications transceiver incorporating silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). During the past year, silicon PICs were characterized and second-generation PICs were designed. A new integrated-photonics project involved the development of high-power, broadband optical sources for interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs). Both the spectral bandwidth and the electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency of these optical sources were improved. Work continued on the development of designs and models to increase the efficiency of quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) operating in the 9-μm-wavelength region for infrared countermeasures. In the area of advanced electronics, work continued on the development of high-power, microwave diamond transistors for radar, electronic-warfare, and communications applications. The current density of diamond p-MOSFETs was increased 100X by applying a NO2 surface treatment and a growth reactor was installed to enable the in-house growth of diamond materials to accelerate progress on this project. The microhydraulic actuator project was refocused to realize configurations that emulate human muscle and single-layer demonstrations were performed.</r2:Text>

The primary goal of this project area is to invest in optical-based technologies that fill the critical technology gaps in emerging DoD threat areas, such as anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), counter–weapons of mass destruction (C-WMD), and asymmetric warfare, as well as to develop revolutionary optical technologies in the traditional DoD mission areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), space control, communications, and ballistic missile defense.</r2:Description>

The portfolio included novel optical technology developments applicable across a broad range of DoD problems. A Digital Coherent Aperture Combiner was developed that performs adaptive optics in the digital domain to synthesize a much larger aperture receiver to reduce the size and cost of communication ground terminals while improving resistance to signal fading. A Deployable In-Space Coherent Imaging Telescope (DISCIT) was designed with the ability to “unfold” a large optical aperture from a small satellite in order to provide transformational advantages to the DoD. This telescope has the goal of demonstrating a 70 cm telescope with single-fold composite hinges and using target in the loop image compensation to achieve image quality comparable to a full-aperture telescope, as well as addressing multiple hinge technology for scaling to larger (multiple meters) apertures. A novel Micro LADAR system for the use on hand-launched unmanned air vehicle was designed, supporting subsystems were developed, and a prototype system was demonstrated on a testbench. An Undersea Optical Communication testbed was developed that successfully demonstrated high data rate optical communication techniques under water. After four years of funding, the Long-Baseline Interferometer testbed completed its final year by successfully designing, fabricating and integrating a novel spectrometer in order to improve the state-of-the-art in sensitivity and image quality by nearly and order of magnitude. A photo-thermal speckle detection technology was developed that can identify chemicals present in trace amounts at small stand-off distances. Such capability is important in the modern battlefield and for protecting crowd in various venues. The Panelized Laser Transceiver effort started mid-year FY 2016 to develop a new architecture for a scalable phased array laser transmitter and receiver.</r2:Text>

Work is on-going to develop hardware that emulates cyber threats to the supply chain. These emulated threats support DoD cyber testing and training activities.

Efforts to better understand vulnerabilities also form another significant branch of the FY 2016 research goals. The current development of metrics and methodologies for evaluating software security by analyzing the exploitability of software vulnerabilities and their exposure to attackers is complemented by the effort to automatically create subtle vulnerabilities within pieces of test software, supporting researchers who seek to build and evaluate software vulnerability detection systems. Several new efforts have been launched which focus on emerging areas of interest, including cyber decision automation using modeling and simulation, exploring the security implications of the Internet of Things in order to create cyber security design guidelines and recommendations for future small satellites, and developing effective indicators for insider threat behavior by analyzing sponsor-provided data.</r2:Text>

In the quantum computing area, Lincoln Laboratory made significant improvements in integrated electronics for trapped ions, co-trapping Calcium and Strontium ions for the first time, which is critical to scalable approaches to ion manipulation and measurement. Advances were also made in three-dimensional integration of superconducting qubits and the design of a chip with five coupled qubits. These experimental efforts were supplemented with advances in simulation of correlated noise/errors to understand its impact on quantum error correction and advances in algorithms for loading large, sparse matrix data into qubits to enable an exponential speedup for an important class of linear algebra algorithms. The FY 2016 quantum communication work included the characterization of a high-rate source and receiver of continuous-variable quantum optical states operating in the ultra-high-bandwidth, low brightness regime. The quantum communication project modified a high-speed secure communication protocol capable of achieving greater than 1-Gbps secure rates over 40-km fiber spans. This represents a 1000x increase in rate over current state-of-the-art quantum key distribution systems. Finally, improvements in the dynamic range and vector measurement capabilities were demonstrated for magnetic sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy atomic defects in diamond.</r2:Text>

The quantum communication entanglement distribution effort is being expanded to a three-node multi-span architecture that includes an investigation into photonic qubit quantum memory architectures based on defect-centers and ion traps.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Our military forces require resilient and reliable networks, information, and weapons systems to conduct effective operations.  However, the number and sophistication of threats in cyberspace are rapidly growing, making it critical to improve the cyber security of all Department of Defense (DoD) systems to counter those threats and assure our missions.  The Cyber Applied Research program focuses on innovative and sustained research in both cyber security and computer network operations to: develop new concepts to harden key network and computer components, design new and resilient cyber infrastructures, increase the military’s ability to disrupt, fight and survive nation-state actors’ cyber-attacks, measure the state of health in cyber security, explore and exploit new ideas in cyber warfare for agile cyber operations and mission assurance, along with the ability to protect tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms.

This program is unique in that it integrates both the defensive and offensive Cyber research from each of the Services to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options targeted to meet Combatant Command (CCMD) needs and requirements. More specifically, by increasing cross-laboratory collaboration, this program is able to take Service-specific technologies and expand their applications to the Joint force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program was initiated in FY 2011 to address specific technical problems that were not being fully addressed by the Services’ and NSA’s existing Cyber S&amp;T investments.  Recently, S&amp;T gaps were enumerated and described in several studies, including the 2015 DoD Cyber Strategy, the 2016 Commission Enhancing National Cybersecurity and the 2017 Defense Science Board Research Enterprise Assessment.  The Cyber Applied Research program builds upon existing basic and applied research results.  The program expands research in cyber command-and-control to provide Warfighters and commanders with tools and technologies to enable cyber situational awareness and protection of tactical networks, weapons systems and platforms. Current technical thrusts include: Foundations of Trust, Resilient Infrastructure, Assuring Effective Missions, Cyber Modeling, Simulation &amp; Experimentation, and Embedded, Mobile &amp; Tactical Environments.

As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology, tactics, and become more skilled and better funded, the Cyber S&amp;T Community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  To bolster this program and address future threats, starting in FY 2017 a new strategic vision was directed at enhancing the DoD’s tactical edge in the rapidly evolving cyber domain where many aspects still remain unexplored.  Judiciously investigating these aspects by investing in the research thrust areas identified below can provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts: 

• Behavioral Cyber Sciences: The interaction between computers and human behavior. Moving beyond signals (ones and zeroes) towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral sciences will increase the effectiveness of tools, the cyber workforce, and cyber solutions at DoD scale.  Behavioral cyber sciences seeks to uncover details about how humans (to include operators, users, adversaries, and/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood from a behavioral science standpoint and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcome.  

• Self-securing weapons, systems, and networks: Thriving in a contested cyber environment.  New sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity will help keep pace with the growing complexity of weapon systems and help the DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.

• Foundations of precision cyber operations: Precision bombing campaigns for the cyber domain.  Accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects will help the DoD leadership achieve the desired effects of cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.

• Mathematical Foundations of Cyber Security: New tools to address new problems.  Advances in mathematical foundations of cyber S&amp;T will cut across focus areas and produce new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.

Advances in these new cyber S&amp;T focus thrust areas will help to promote strong foundations and disruptive innovations that will create surprises, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas will be critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cyber security beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort completed the compilation of a library of GPU tools. 

“Pointillist” a project executed by John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), developed a graph analytic engine to monitor network traffic in real-time.  The features of Pointillist allow hunt teams to visualize and identify adversarial network traffic faster.  The work developed an infrastructure that tailored user interfaces with automated software-driven processes and supported easy configuration of incoming data streams.  The interactive visualization tool improved interoperability to increase ease-of-adoption and decrease training time for analysts working on specialized missions such as Cyber Protection Team Hunt sub-teams.  This helped improve trust and provide real-time situational awareness (SA) of cyber enabled assets.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>Resilient Infrastructure entails the ability to withstand cyber attacks, and to sustain or recover critical functions.  This provides the ability to continue to perform functions and provide services at required levels during an attack.  The objective in this area is to develop integrated architectures that are optimized for their ability to absorb (cyber) shock and recover in a timely fashion to a known secure state with well-defined performance characteristics.  Resilient algorithms and protocols increase the repertoire of resiliency mechanisms available to the infrastructure and architecture.  Research is needed to develop resiliency at lower levels with specific algorithms and protocols to support higher-level resilient architectures.</r2:Description>

The project developed a cost effective, high throughput, government-off-the-shelf cross domain solution that was demonstrated at various venues including the Universal Gateway (UGW)/Pump-II Limited Technology Experiment.  The impact of research under “Pump-II” provided the war-fighter with improved sensitive data correlation and intelligent data decision capabilities.  A number of transitions are under way with the Naval Air Systems Command, Triton Unmanned Aircraft System Program Office for Pump-II with Secret and Below Interoperability certification and the Office of Naval Research Integrated Topside and Multi-Link Common Data Link System with Top Secret and Below Interoperability certifications.

The “Tactical Platform Resiliency” project executed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) improved the design and robustness of various fault tolerant tools used to harden critical control systems.  The effort also designed and developed capabilities to monitor and autonomously remove malicious code and commands and data from compromised networks. 

The “Control Flow Integrity Monitoring” project executed by JHU/APL developed methods of detecting “return-oriented” programming attacks using record-and-replay technology.  This technology enabled the rapid detection of some zero-day attacks that otherwise bypass all modern defenses.  This eliminated the effectiveness of a large class of exploits. 

A second JHU/APL executed project, “System Cloaking Defense through Deception,” demonstrated ways to present decoys to adversaries and detect their presence and activities.  A major impact of the project raised attacker workloads, confused, delayed, and disrupted an adversary’s ability to execute exploitation operations.  System cloaking is being considered for transition to a number of organizations namely ONR, Army Cyber (ARCYBER), Marine Force Cyber (MARFORCYBER) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>The objective of Assuring Effective Missions presents technology challenges in the areas of Cyber Mission Control and Effects at Scale.  Within this thrust, we aim to develop the ability to assess and control the cyber situation within a military mission context.  Cyber Mission Control covers the ability to orchestrate cyber systems to achieve an overarching mission goal by developing tools and techniques that enable models of cyber operational behaviors (cyber and kinetic) to determine the correct course of action in the cyber domain.  Effects at Scale encompass full spectrum challenges that intersect with cyber becoming a new full-fledged domain of warfare.

This program funds an international research collaboration effort under the Mission Assurance Research Collaboration (MARC) project arrangement.  The overall research focus of MARC is to enhance mission assurance through data enrichment, deep learning and natural language processing.  MARC aims to provide dynamic mission mapping capability by enabling the timely identification and characterization of cyber terrain, missions and their interdependencies.</r2:Description>

The interoperable reference architecture provides an ability to detect, maneuver and restore impacted capabilities “to survive and operate through the fight” for existing and future OCO architectures.  Additionally, the OCO architecture supports USCYBERCOMMAND’s priority number one and two gaps for cyber infrastructure defense and SA. 

The Mission Assurance Research Collaboration (MARC) program arrangement was formally initiated as a bilateral research effort between the U.S. and Australia.  Program planning and experimental design was completed during this fiscal year.  Additionally, the research team made improvements to the mission mapping algorithm and established a bilateral collaborative environment.</r2:Text>

There are two technical challenges associated with cyber MSE: 1) Cyber Modeling and Simulation, and 2) Cyber Measurement.  Cyber Modeling and Simulation seeks to develop tools and techniques that enable analytical modeling and multi-scale simulation of complex cyber systems.  Cyber Measurement develops cyber experimentation and test range technology to conduct controlled, repeatable experiments, providing the ability to track the progress of cyber research investments in a quantitative fashion.  This area explores new analytical methodologies, models, and experimental data sets to establish metrics to measure a system’s state of security, apply the scientific method to establish the foundations of a framework in which cyber security research can be conducted, to test hypotheses with measurable and repeatable results, and the quantitative experimentation and assessment for new cyber technologies.  These new methodologies will enable the exploration of modeling and simulation tools and techniques that can drive innovation in research.  Additionally, these methodologies will aid in integrated experimentation by simulating the cyber environment with sufficient fidelity and integrating cyber modeling and simulation with the traditional modeling and simulation related to the kinetic domain.</r2:Description>

Cyber operations should be seen in the context of a larger socio-behavioral-technical domain.  Research in behavioral cyber science seeks to advance the understanding and technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities and to discover ways to inject this understanding into the human aspects of cyber operations, cyber defense systems, planning, and training.  Future research must broaden the scope beyond the impacts of cyber actions on equipment, and also include the impact that these cyber actions will have on broader human behavior.  Just as an adversary’s behavior may be better understood using behavioral cyber science, behavioral science can be utilized to help understand ways to improve the actions of cyber defenders and the performance of the cyber workforce.  Data gleaned from observing effects of various cyber operations on users’ productivity, performance, and security will help the cyber workforce design better techniques and processes for use in cyber defense.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The pervasive nature of software-reliant systems in today’s modern military creates new opportunities for sophisticated adversaries.  The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against cyber-attacks.  Defending the software- and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  We can expect future cyber adversaries to be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that can defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against this adversary.  We need systems that can autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems could identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, able to neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems is crucial to ensure that direct control can be reasserted, potentially reversing some actions, if necessary.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>When compared to traditional methods of kinetic warfare, cyber conflict is still relatively new and untested.  Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their target prior to completing an action.  The lack of a complete picture makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. In this type of uncertain environment, military leaders may be acting with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities.  Improved technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects, estimating their cost and effectiveness, predicting consequences, and ensuring precise effects will help both to limit collateral damage and to ensure that a chosen action has the intended effect upon the adversary.  Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information.</r2:Description>

Broadly, there is a need for an array of modeling techniques, both informal and formal, backed by various rigorous mathematical theories, to capture and support the richness of the cyber domain.  This area of research is needed to help characterize the cyber domain and cyber security, maintain the integrity of data, harden systems, and analyze potential solutions.  Continued research in mathematical theory beyond the “basic research” level is crucial to maintain and increase the security of cyber systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is a key to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research program element (PE) develops and evaluates the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts, with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The SEI’s program of work is coordinated across the DoD through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD’s Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE benefits every Community of Interest due to the ubiquitous nature of software, but particularly benefits: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) which includes a computing and software sub-panel; Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  

Work conducted under this PE will enable resilient mission assurance in heterogeneous and contested environments through the verification and validation of system performance and architecture. The program will also assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage in the areas of software-intensive systems and cybersecurity by enhancing assurance, exploiting automation, and understanding human-computer interaction.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This thrust seeks to develop verification techniques for requirements identification, systems of systems architectures, and virtual integration of components.  Additionally, research in this area will enable requirements verification for software assurance, analysis and control of unverified code, and automated repair of damaged code.  Software production and code analysis methods developed through this program will also improve the accuracy of behavior prediction of complex software system in untested environments.  Increasingly numerous lines of code will require a commensurate increase in sophistication of verification and validation mechanisms.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Information assurance ensures the integrity of information and data produced by software.  Software developed from an unknown supply chain may include intentionally or unintentionally introduced vulnerabilities.  This thrust seeks to develop scalable automated methods to locate, understand, and mitigate the effects of these vulnerabilities.  Automated tools developed through this thrust will be used to discover vulnerabilities in system software (including binary only) and to generate proofs.  Additionally, they will be used to model and simulate operational environments to support software and cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) testing. 

Warfighting in the cyber domain often operates at sub-second timescales and across multiple domains of authority.  Methods used to accomplish many tasks (e.g., malware analysis, coordinating multiple agents) demand large amounts of time, attention, and special skills and are not scalable.  This thrust seeks to develop and increase the use of automation to simplify the completion of these tasks.  Example activities include automation of moving target defenses, code artifact reverse engineering, analysis of network flows at enterprise scale, and development and assessment of workforce skills.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Offices (PEO) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2018 and 2023 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEO for insertion in their Insensitive Munition (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technical Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) laboratory representatives and senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.

The IM effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  MATGs, under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the PEO IM Strategic Plans.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.

The Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology effort will also demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development (GDF) of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration weapons and programs based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the PEOs and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  In this way, promising multi-point initiation architectures, high reliability fuze architectures, survivable components, modular fuze packaging, and components produced based on ease of manufacturing can be integrated into munitions applications and its ability to address required capability needs will be validated.  Mature fuze technologies will be transitioned to Weapon PEO’s and/or Industry, thereby decreasing program costs and schedule risk while facilitating technology into potentially broader range of munitions applications.

The JFTP investments focus on four specific capability areas that have been identified by the Department's strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and as validated by the PEOs and the Service S&amp;T communities.  The capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.  The Fuzing technologies will be incorporated in weapon applications to demonstrate their maturity and utility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address priority capability areas identified in the Guidance for Development of the Force, the Secretary of Defense Memorandum, DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions and Unintended Harm to Civilians, and shortfalls in current weapon systems.  This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities.  Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by Department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities.  These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three Technology Areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and delivers these capabilities to U.S., interagency, and international users through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation. CTTS is expanding its partnerships with other Defense rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and Interagency users. 

CTTS major area of emphasis during FY16 and FY17 will be projects to Countering-ISIL.  Projects are distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytics and Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat; Investigative Support and Forensics; Personnel Protection, Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; Training Technology Development; and a new working group, Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats.

Specific CTTS areas of emphasis in FY16 and FY17 include Counter-tunnel, Countering-UAVs, Countering-Violent Extremism, and Improving Digital Operations at the tactical level.  The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-principle demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 450 individual projects in support of Defense, federal, state, local, and International customers and partners. 

The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, the Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and other Federal Departments and International partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTSO has earned throughout the Department and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products. 

In FY16, CTTS focused on DoD requirements that supported military forces and interagency operators in demanding or hostile environments such as Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Africa and in the domestic environment by leading the Department in rapidly developing and delivering leading edge products such as CORIAN and MARS-K counter small UAS systems currently deployed to Iraq; tactical tethered ISR vehicles; applications for operational and intelligence collection and analysis of Publically Available Information (PAI) now a Program of Record for USSOCOM; cyber training COSMO and COG that are now Program of Record for the Special Warfare Center and School; an underwater remote operating vehicle (UROV); miniature handheld spectrometers; ruggedized CB protective clothing; systems integration and environment testing of the HALO Maritime Barrier System; and enhancement of the SUNet, off-GIG encrypted communications and data sharing system.

At the tactical level, CTTS will increasingly address technology requirements requested from USSOCOM’s field components as they increase their regional operations tempo in Iraq, Syria, and Africa.  CTTS will address weight reduction of small arms and ammunition; and secure communications for small units deployed to austere and hostile environments; and mobile counter small UAS systems. Another area of continued emphasis will be the protection of U.S. personnel, to include State Department personnel in embassy and consulate locations overseas that need increased security.  Additionally, in response to congressional direction, CTTS will continue its partnership with Israel to address their tunnel threat and ensure the joint ventures are beneficial U.S. counter-tunnel activities. 

CTTS will continue to actively support the Department’s Homeland Defense mission for advanced technology and capabilities that will (1) enhance security along the U.S. Southwest Border and (2) proactively address improvised devices and other chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats in a domestic environment.  Additionally, CTTS will assist federal; state and local law enforcement in improving their capabilities investigate and mitigate acts of terrorism in CONUS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program Element (PE) 0603133D8Z focuses on Pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (Pre-EMD) and Proof of Principle prototypes derived from evaluation of foreign equipment that will provide the U.S. Armed Services, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and Defense agencies capabilities to counter emerging threats.  FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD), Multi-Service and Combatant Command (CCMD) priority requirements.  FCT also increases competition, ensuring our personnel have access to the best technology available.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FCT program supports the warfighter by leveraging technologies and equipment developed by allied nations and coalition partners to counter emerging threats, thereby accelerating the DoD acquisition process and lowering development costs.  FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments.

The FCT program is a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between foreign and U.S. industries.  Many successful FCT projects result in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States.  Other nations recognize the long-term value of such practices for competing in the U.S. Defense market and the resultant strengthening of the "two-way street" in Defense procurement.  The result often means the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies throughout the United States.  To date, companies from 34 states benefited from FCT projects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This M3A1 project will eliminate six pounds (28 percent) from the existing weapon by replacing the existing steel tube with a titanium alloy tube, along with other components (bolt, trigger, venturi, and ancillary parts) without changing the firing procedures, operations or ammunition.  Since no operational characteristics will be changed, this low-risk approach will produce a lighter weight 84mm shoulder-fired weapon for less cost and time than normally required to test and qualify a new weapon system.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The SPIRIT system incorporates e-textiles for power and data distribution, provides “plug-and-play” capability for various Soldier worn systems, and communicates control signals from an end-user-device.  The proposed system addresses future capabilities for Small Unit Power Increment II/III as defined by Army Maneuver Center of Excellence for e-textiles and wireless charging as well as requirements for United States Marine Corps (USMC) Marine Enhancement Program.  USMC is interested in the technology and will participate in project reviews.  Specifically, the e-textile capability will provide the capability to distribute power and data without using cables and be able to wirelessly re-charge an attached battery thus reducing the soldier's load.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This effort will demonstrate all criteria needed for proceeding with a major fielding program for a small GPS anti-jam smart antenna solution for the H-1Y/Z aircraft.  This small GPS anti-jam smart antenna system will be a common material solution for the UH-1Y and AH-1Z as both platforms currently share the same unprotected antenna-to-GPS receiver navigation system architecture.  This new antenna system when coupled to an Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation system will eliminate mission capability gaps associated with a variety of H-1Y/Z missions adversely affected in a GPS signal degraded anti-access/area denial environment.  The UH-1Y and AH-1Z helicopters are among the last Marine manned platforms without a GPS anti-jam antenna system as small anti-jam solutions were not available until now due to size, weight and power limitations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP is aligned with the Department's strategic plans and policies such as:

•  Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
•  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
•  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
•  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
•  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
•  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
•  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

•  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD, and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 70 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  In FY 2014 it was projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons, including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
     - The Army Armament Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
     - The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
     - CHEETAH, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
     - The JMP-supported Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Three-Dimensional (ALE3D) code was used in a high-explosive press accident investigation which helped determine the root cause. The code was also utilized successfully in the M433E1 mortar bomb design, and has been used to assess blast effects on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. 
     - The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC), and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).
•  New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association, recognizing significant contributions to the development, introduction, or support of precision strike systems.
•  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
•  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
•  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
•  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
•  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 
•  Characterization and analysis of the Army’s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.
•  The Mortar, Anti-Personnel, Anti-Materiel (MAPAM) projectile used the ViscoSCRAM (Statistical CRAck Mechanics)model for PBXN-110 to determine if flaws in production could safely be fired, potentially saving millions of dollars.  
•  Provided Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) adaption technology to a number of DoD laboratories, including ARDEC and ARL.
•  Materials and modeling technologies developed and demonstrated in the JMP are being transitioned to a variety of DoD Army programs including the Scalable Technology for Adaptive Response (STAR) Army Technology Objective (ATO), the Future Requirements of Enhanced Energetics for Decisive Munitions (FREEDM) program, and Advanced Warheads for Scalable Effects Munitions (AWSEM).  

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 31 current and two planned JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, explosive, fuzing, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable major improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment to this effort.  The JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions design and evaluation, including evaluation of vulnerability and the design of insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP is aligned with the Department's strategic plans and policies such as:

•  Munitions for contingency operations, particularly for the reduction of unintended collateral effects.
•  Reducing time and cost for acquisition of munitions.
•  Rapidly transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) to support the warfighter in today’s conflicts.
•  Establishing future core capabilities and maintaining our national S&amp;T capabilities through joint investment and interagency cooperation and teaming.
•  Aiding in recruiting and retaining high-caliber scientists and engineers at DoD S&amp;T organizations.
•  Developing advanced munitions technologies to support the increased role of conventional weapons to deter and respond to non-nuclear attack, as described in the Nuclear Posture Review report.
•  Developing safer munitions that are compliant with IM standards to meet statutory and Department policy requirements.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  This community develops technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of over 25 senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD needs.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP has a long history of successful transitions and significant Return on Investment (ROI).

•  The JMP is the primary developer of high-performance structural mechanics computer codes used by DoD, and the primary source for transitioning these codes to the DoD.  JMP computational tools are critical to the development and support of DoD programs; a recent tabulation shows that well over 50 DoD programs have been supported by these DOE codes.  For FY 2014 it is projected by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) that JMP-supported codes will have accounted for 82 percent of all HPCMP Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, including virtually all HPCMP classified computing.  The total CPU hours represents an eight-fold increase from FY 2012.  The Department expects this heavy reliance on DOE codes to continue for several reasons, including: preference for using DOE codes because they are export-controlled; DOE codes are scalable, incorporate multiphysics, and run on massively parallel computer systems; and the Department can obtain source codes to modify for individual Service needs.
     -  A significant number of defense industrial contractors also use the DOE structural mechanics computer codes.
     -  Cheetah, a standalone thermochemical computer code, is the most widely used code by DoD and defense contractors for predicting performance of energetic materials.
     -  The Army Armament Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center (ARDEC) has stated that the DOE computer codes are now routinely used to design all new warheads.  The use of these tools has reduced the number of validation tests required for each new warhead from about five to one with concomitant cost and time savings.
     -  The Army Research Laboratory has used DOE computer codes to develop and deploy new armor solutions to Iraq and Afghanistan with unprecedented speed.
•  New munitions’ case material and explosive fill technologies provide the warfighter with a lethal and low collateral damage capability.  These technologies have been transitioned to the Focused Lethality Munition variant of the Small Diameter Bomb, which is currently fielded.  The technologies were also the basis for a new GBU 129 weapon that has been developed to meet a Joint Urgent Operational Need requirement for a low-collateral MK-82 class weapon.  The GBU-129/B received the 2014 William J. Perry Award from the Precision Strike Association, recognizing significant contributions to the development, introduction, or support of precision strike systems.
•  The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) has supported applications of JMP technologies, including:  compact synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems for counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) efforts; pre-deployment training of military personnel by DOE explosive experts on how to recognize feed stocks and processes for homemade explosives; and use of massively parallel, multiphysics computer codes to understand how explosive blast waves cause brain injury and how to mitigate these injuries.
•  The JMP-supported CTH and Sierra codes were used for the Air Force Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Quick Reaction Effort (QRC), and the Air Force Research Laboratory Conventional Survivable Ordnance Package (CSOP).
•  An erosive initiator technology developed under the JMP has been transitioned to the Services for use in selectable output weapons and self-destruct capabilities.
•  A novel approach to controlling the sensitivity and therefore the initiability of explosives using microwave energy, as well two new, insensitive energetic materials have transitioned to development projects in the Joint IM Technology and Joint Fuze Technology Programs.
•  Reliability analysis tools were used by Army Missile Command to assess Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire command data-linked guided Missile (TOW).
•  Robotic demilitarization processing systems were installed at several locations, including a system at Hawthorne Army Depot to recover copper shape charge liners, Comp A5, and grenade bodies. 
•  Characterization and analysis of the Army’s Excalibur fusible plug resulted in a savings of at least $2.000 million.

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  In addition to the computer codes mentioned earlier, the JMP has transitioned case technology for low-collateral weapons, low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology for smaller, less expensive fuze electronic components, and erosive initiator technology for selectable effects weapons to defense industrial suppliers.

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 33 current JMP projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining lethality, effects, and safety.

The Department is working to increase the range and velocity of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and initiability.
TCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.

The specific projects in the energetic materials technical focus area for FY16 are:
-  Synthesis, properties, and scale-up of new energetic compounds.
-  Insensitive munitions and surety.
-  Cheetah thermochemical code development and experiments.
-  Micro- and nano-energetics synthesis and initiation.
-  Hazards analysis of energetic materials.
-  Reactive processes in energetic materials.
-  Development of tools for energetic material performance characterization.
-  Explosives chemistry and properties, and new energetic materials formulation.

                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

-  Firing Systems Technology, comprising FireMod firing set code model development and validation, 1.6 hazard classification detonator development, and initiation and detonation physics on the millimeter scale.

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  Significant increases in warhead performance are directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.

-  Multiphase blast munitions (MBX) technology.
-  Dynamic behavior of concrete. (New start in FY16)

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:
-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports the development of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States.  These capabilities include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, strategic lift, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and others outlined in the 2015 National Military Strategy.  Analytic assessments are informed comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2015-2035 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas and help to support detailed analyses and assessments to inform and influence programmatic decisions regarding technology development and procurement plans.  The science and technology (S&amp;T) analytic assessments performed under this budget item include the following activities:

-  Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.
-  Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.
-  Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.
-  Development of strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.
-  Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies. 

Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.  The emerging nature of the problem sets makes identification of studies beyond the budget year unlikely.  Typically, the ratios of resources applied to quick reaction studies, strategic analysis, and development of analytic tools will be roughly 30/50/20 percent.  The first step in the process is to quickly assess gaps and options to fill those gaps; second, produce detailed analysis quantifying key attributes of the challenge, assess options, and provide an operational value assessment; and finally, develop analytic tools to help understanding of complex and longer term challenges. Implementation of this process could span multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year to year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Third Eye is a data architecture that leverages existing and emerging sensors to provide real-time tracking and targeting for multi-Service strike weapons. The project will enhance tracking against hard targets in denied environments and maintain ability to securely communicate with these sensors in real-time. Due to the classified nature of this project, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level. The Third Eye project will transition to the Advanced Innovative Technologies Program Element (PE) 0604250D8Z in FY 2017.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department.  In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation, will be a source of battlefield advantage.

The Program is focused on developing space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability for defeating threats posed by nuclear-capable, mobile missile - a problem set often plagued by sparse data.  Our approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT for automated anomaly and change detection throughout the country of interest - crucial element for enhancing  our indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.  These blocks will serve to overcome the sparse data problem set and reduce the decision-making process.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department.  In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation, will be a source of battlefield advantage.

The Program is focused on developing space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability for defeating threats posed by nuclear-capable, mobile missile - a problem set often plagued by sparse data.  Our approach is composed of three innovative building blocks:  1)  Machine learning techniques applied to commercial GEOINT for automated anomaly and change detection throughout the country of interest - crucial element for enhancing  our indications and warnings required for precision strikes; 2)  Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3)  Autonomous weaponeering demonstration - Exercise secure (C2S) cloud for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.  These blocks will serve to overcome the sparse data problem set and reduce the decision-making process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>To counter the United States’ historic technological advantage, adversaries are increasingly developing asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices that have become globally available. These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, unmanned air systems and easily transportable man portable air defense systems to dedicated military systems that can diminish our technological advantage in conflicts with nation-states. They include cruise and ballistic missiles, integrated air defense systems (IADS) and the advanced sensor systems used by them to detect and target U.S. forces, and advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems used to deny or negate our sensors, communications and precision navigation and targeting capabilities.

The rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and new threats are emerging faster than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development and acquisition processes can respond. The plethora of new electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats is making operations in the EMS significantly more complex. The challenges posed by new kinetic and non-kinetic threats and the dire consequences of  technology surprise emphasize the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can address new threats in fiscally and temporally responsible ways.

The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) Program addresses these challenges through efforts designed to accelerate the pace of EW and EW-Cyber capabilities development by exploring technologies and using approaches that fall outside the scope or purview of the Services’ research and development (R&amp;D) programs. Enabling the rapid transition of significant technologies to Service Programs of Record (PoR) at lower cost with lower risk is essential. JEAT thus explores and assesses technological approaches that integrate and demonstrate both new and off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways. 

JEAT efforts are focused in four areas under two Project Codes, P619 (Joint Electronic Advanced Technology) and P245 (EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation). (1) Experimentation/Demonstration (P619) utilizes innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to understand current and future threats and explore potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities. (2) Advanced Technology Development/Verification (P619) explores technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways. (3) EW Collaboration &amp; Planning (P619) ensures appropriate technological oversight of Departmental and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D programs and processes and provides necessary governance insights for senior decision makers. (4) EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation (P245) accelerates the fielding of essential EW capabilities such as innovative countermeasures to new classes of advanced threats (including anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats), and exploring and developing a variety of non-kinetic technologies, tools, and approaches to counter advanced threats and enhancing operators’ and analysts’ comprehension of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment to enable real-time precision employment of non-kinetic capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) explores and assesses innovative technologies and approaches to rapidly mitigate advanced threats and demonstrate new overmatch technologies in ways not being explored by the Services. JEAT’s three efforts, Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo), Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V), and EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P), focus on enabling nearer-term technology transitions to the Services’ Programs of Record (PoR) with reduced risk and cost. Expt/Demo efforts focus on exploring, demonstrating, and assessing innovative technologies and approaches to overcome existing and developing threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for the U.S. military. ATD/V efforts integrate advanced commercial and military off-the-shelf technologies in ways not being explored by the Services to demonstrate nearer-term technological opportunities. EW C&amp;P efforts within Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office (EWCO) of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering assess, ensure coordination and provide senior leadership insights on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber research and development (R&amp;D) as well as coordinating national and international EW and EW-Cyber efforts. 

Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo):

Expt/Demo explores and demonstrates new EW and EW-Cyber technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experimentation venues. The current venue, Vigilant Hammer (VH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive event focused on advancing the state of the art for detecting, classifying, geolocating, and engaging of electromagnetic signals of interest. Modeled after JEAT’s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, and Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE) venues, VH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants an opportunity to explore the efficacy of existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats. Follow-on venues will address concerns such as multi-platform/multi-aperture, collaborative/coherent EW and attacking multistatic passive/active sensing architectures.

Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V):

ATD/V explores, matures and assesses emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs. JEAT’s ongoing ATD/V effort, the Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory, explores, matures and assesses emerging EW and EW-Cyber technologies to enable, for example, multi-aperture collaborative/coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment through exquisite coordination of sensing and electronic attack capabilities. 

EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P):

EW C&amp;P supports all activities of the Director, EWCO, related to the selection, organization, oversight, and coordination of all EW- and EW-Cyber-related efforts across DoD. EW C&amp;P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, and the Services on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD. To do this, EW C&amp;P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW- and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensor, seeker, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures and battle management technologies. EW C&amp;P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) on PoR, including technology maturity and availability, Critical Program Information standards, Foreign Disclosure, and Technical Signals Requirements. EW C&amp;P also conducts and leads analyses of advanced threats and technological opportunities to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D research, development and acquisition efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Our next Expt/Demo venue, Nike’s Hammer, will focus on multi-platform/multi-aperture nonkinetic (electronic and digital) engagement (NKE) of multistatic passive/active sensing architectures. As with VH and earlier all earlier JEAT experimentation venues, Nike’s Hammer and subsequent future venues will be scoped to address the most pressing electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats, and the selection of venue topics and the scoping of these efforts will involve the EW and Cyber Communities of Interest and EXCOMs to ensure maximum relevance and benefits to Departmental efforts.</r2:Description>

New capabilities developed in this effort will counter current and future radar threats, provide improved communications operational availability by adding a spectral "relocation" coordination capability and mitigate co-site interference on a mission by mission basis by utilizing dynamically reprogrammable channelized amplifiers and digital filters. Specific efforts included:

• Initial threat systems evaluation conducted to support technology requirements definition. 
• Initial architectural design (systems and RF) identified and drafted. This included a modular system mechanical layout supporting ground, air and surface system needs and functionality inclusion to support spectrum relocation and co-site interference mitigation.
• Identified technology requirements needed to provide spectrum diverse capabilities from up to millimeter wave in alignment with the above listed threats.
• Significant market research completed including meeting with industry partners.
• Investigated, identified and procured advanced transceiver technologies.
• Investigated, identified and procured advanced modem and network technologies including waveform transitions.
• Investigated amplifier technologies, solid state and microwave power module. 
• Investigated general antenna technologies and implementations for both podded and external mounting options.
• Investigated industry standards to determine best approach to support the open architecture design.
• Evaluated simultaneous transmit and receive antenna technologies and analog cancellers.
• Evaluated phased array antennas.

These efforts will be continued under USMC program funding starting in FY 2017.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program supports the identification, development, and demonstration of game-changing technologies to satisfy Multi-Service and Combatant Commands (CCMDs) priorities.  The JCTD program engages the interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the Department of Defense's (DoD) access to innovation.  It serves as the vehicle for CCMDs and Services to address strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment as identified by the Chairman’s Gap Assessment, Services science and technology roadmaps and other senior level guidance.  

JCTD projects are executed in the following focus areas: electromagnetic spectrum maneuver; space capability resilience; autonomous systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, asymmetric force application and information operations and analytics.  The objective is to maintain U.S. technological superiority across the range of military operations.  The JCTD program achieves this objective by reducing the cost of operations, and allowing for the rapid insertion of new capabilities within two to four years.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>JCTD funding is used to address near and mid-term CCMD and Joint Forces capability gaps.  It provides a mechanism for DoD-wide prototyping and demonstration of game-changing technologies in operationally relevant environments.  In FY 2016, the JCTD Program successfully completed the military utility assessment and transition of several JCTD prototypes that fielded affordable and sustainable solutions to meet immediate operational needs.  

Key values demonstrated by the JCTD program are:

•	Create a bridge from science and technology to operational use and formal acquisition.

•	Accelerate fielding of decisive technical capabilities while mitigating operational risk to the warfighter.

•	Leverage open architectures to enhance interoperability and promote affordability.

•	The JCTD program delivers capabilities far quicker than the traditional DoD planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) process.  Recent examples include: 

     1.  The Advanced Weapons Enhanced by Submarine Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) against Mobile Targets (AWESUM) JCTD.  The AWESUM JCTD developed a three inch diameter unmanned aerial system (UAS).  The UAS is deployed from submarine countermeasure launchers.  UAS control and sensor feeds are fully integrated into the submarine combat control system enabling rapid development of fire control solutions for torpedo and third party targeting, and battle damage assessment following engagements.  AWESUM transitioned to U.S. Navy submarines in 2016.

     2.  In support of the Army Robotic Systems Joint Program Office, the Autonomous Mobility Applique Systems (AMAS) JCTD successfully developed, demonstrated and transitioned autonomous capabilities to the U.S. Army Route Clearance and Integration System Program of Record (PoR) that will be incorporated into existing Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) program of record.  AMAS has completely changed the Army’s future ground robotics plans and requirements and will have a lasting impact on future ground autonomous programs through the application of lessons learned and capability from the AMAS JCTD.

     3.  The High Speed Container Delivery System (HSCDS) JCTD developed a parachute system to offload up to eight container delivery system bundles at an elevation of 250 feet and 250 knots from C-130J and C-17 aircraft.  This has significantly improved the accuracy of existing delivery systems while providing increased safety for the aircraft and friendly ground forces.  HSCDS transitioned to the Army’s Product Manager for Force Sustainment Systems, has been extensively used in Afghanistan and used to deliver humanitarian assistance to Yazidi people on Mount Sinjar, Iraq.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:
  
• JCTDs will demonstrate capability objectives within two to four years. 
• The JCTD program will continue to achieve high transition rates.  In FY 2016, 88 percent of completed JCTDs successfully transitioned.  Seven of sixteen completed JCTDs transitioned to a new or existing Program(s) of Record.  Seven transitioned to fieldable-prototypes (residual capabilities) sustained by non-JCTD funds in direct support of operations in theater.  Two were returned to the technology base for further analysis and/or future use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2016 $2.000 million reprogramming entry is the net of -$2.000 million to resource AT&amp;L priority projects and a $4.000 million reprogramming to remunerate JCTD for funds extended to Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (Program Element 0603699D8Z) during 2016 for the Missile Defeat Project. 

The decrease in the funding profile from FY 2017 to FY 2018 is due to a one-time funding increase to FY 2017 to support CCMD prototyping activities as well as FY 2018 base adjustments.

The FY 2018 base adjustment reflects a -$10.000 million India Science &amp; Technology baseline transfer to Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (Program Element 0603699D8Z) to enable proper alignment and execution of the effort, and a -$0.104 million base adjustment for higher DoD priorities.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                                    <r2:Description>LCASD will develop and demonstrate technologies that enable rapid design, manufacturing, test and deployment of very low cost (essentially expendable) airframes.  The strategic objective is to challenge the cost paradigm associated with current airframe manufacturing.  LCASD will conclude with a demonstration of an aircraft capable of 1000 nautical mile flight range and costing less than $3.000 million.  This will be realized through a number of innovative prototyping and experimentation approaches that include new manufacturing technologies, very low cost life cycle control measures in the airframe design (i.e. reliability as needed, modeling and simulation for advance performance testing, etc.).  The effort will also include use of engineered resilient systems (ERS) technology to develop fixed-wing trade space analysis tools to allow for rapid optimization and manufacturing of future systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Low Cost Missile Defeat (LCMD) is a ballistic missile defense system designed to counter current and emerging weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats.  LCMD program execution has been structured using a building block approach; the FY 2015 step was a technology demonstration effort under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping (DASD (EC&amp;P)) to accelerate technology maturation.  The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the system has been formulated to integrate LCMD into the existing National Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) architecture and will prioritize the use of existing components and systems already fielded.  LCMD is not designed as a replacement to existing BMD systems, but rather as a lower cost complementary/augmentative component to forward-deployed BMD assets.  The LCMD capability will augment current BMD systems and mitigate threat vulnerabilities to U.S. personnel and strategic assets.</r2:Description>

Agility is achieved through a smaller footprint, commercial off-the-shelf infusion, and quick reaction of theater-based repair assets (e.g. pre-packaged, pre-positioned).  The intent of PIER is to assure continued logistics resiliency and freedom for our U.S. Forces to maneuver and conduct agile strategic sealift and logistics.  PIER will allow the Department to address the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facility, and policy (DOTMLPF+P) concerns about its ability to conduct rapid port damage repair.

                                                    <r2:Description>This effort is comprised of three programs that support the entire JCTD Program, separate from the specific JCTD projects.  The three programs are (1) Unified CCMD Direct Support, (2) JCTD Pre-Transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD Direct Support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project development, demonstration, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD Program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling the CCMDs to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD Pre-Transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD assessment phase due to Service or Agency commitments.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD Pre-Transition fund may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness (SSA) intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing program of record (PoR).  The existing PoR can acquire, further develop, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the Capabilities Development Document or Capabilities Production Document) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
-  The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability, using procurement funds.
-  Results of JCTD can be used to inform the research and engineering, acquisition, or requirements process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) will be adversely affected during operations in contested Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers (strategic, operational, and tactical) and domains (nuclear, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance [ISR], command and control [C2], etc.) and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders (JFCCs), Joint Force Commanders (JFCs), and deployed forces.
 
The DoD’s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs. In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS (BLOS), and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a “leap ahead” of today’s capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  The primary threat is from  advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to be more capable and agile.  Concurrently, DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communications links of today.

Beginning in FY 2016, the NCCP’s Future Autonomous Battlespace RF with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) (formerly referred to as Robust Tactical Data Links Modernization (RTDLM)) project will develop next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) threat environments. This architecture will also deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture will be flexible enough to support Commander’s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC’s efforts will focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam(AJ)/Low Probability of Interference (LPI)/Low Probability of Detection (LPD)/ Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms, adaptive processing algorithms, adaptive antenna technologies (transmit/receive/nulling), adaptive power control, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques, self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening, and advanced routing ensuring Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing  resilient TDLs, communications and networking “service level” capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.

Based on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC will verify the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitate the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521, the latter of which represents the Department’s comprehensive advanced manufacturing program focused on enabling the strategic goals of timely, affordable delivery of dominant technologies to the warfighter, and improving the acquisition and sustainment of defense products and systems across their life cycles.  Designing for manufacturability early in the development of defense-essential products and systems can yield dramatic and positive impacts for the Department’s operational and modernization missions. 
			
The DMS&amp;T component of the DoD ManTech program specifically focuses on the development of cross-cutting and potentially game-changing manufacturing technologies, processes and capabilities that are typically beyond the scope or risk of any one Military Department or Defense Agency or platform.These high-leverage, defense-wide investments are designed to benefit the performance, affordability, and delivery timelines/deployment cycles of many of the department’s most essential products and systems in ways that are not typically achievable through the efforts of a single service, agency or program office.
			
The DMS&amp;T program, therefore, is a unique and fundamental DoD ManTech Program component that is needed to optimize a coordinated manufacturing technology development process across the department broadly.  Concurrent development of manufacturing processes and capabilities along with S&amp;T development enables the timely, affordable adoption and deployment of emerging technologies needed to maintain U.S. warfighting dominance.  Key DMS&amp;T technical areas for investment include Advanced Electronics and Optics Manufacturing, Advanced Materials Manufacturing, Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing, and respective technology focus areas addressed by each of the DoD-led manufacturing innovation institutes (discussed in the next paragraph).  Advanced Electronics and Optics addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Advanced Materials addresses advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of materials such as composites, metals, ceramics, nanomaterials, metamaterials, and low observables.  Enterprise and Emerging Manufacturing addresses advanced manufacturing technologies and enterprise business practices for defense applications.  Key focus areas include the industrial information infrastructure, advanced design/qualification/cost tools, supply network integration technologies and management practices, direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, machining; robotics, assembly, and joining.

Manufacturing innovation institutes established by the DoD and part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program are also funded in this program element. Technical innovation and leadership in U.S. manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of industrial competitiveness to enable our military to maintain technological advantage and global dominance. Eight DoD Manufacturing USA institutes have been established to serve as regional hubs accelerating technological innovation and associated production processes and educational/workforce competencies for military and commercial applications via shared public-private sectors.  These Manufacturing USA institutes, supported by resources from multiple U.S. Government agencies, are generating significant industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and are forming new technology transition pathways via regional hubs spurring active collaboration among government, industry, and academia to help meet critical government and warfighter needs. The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The growth in funding in this PE from prior President's budgets is primarily associated with P350 investments.

P350 Manufacturing Innovation Institutes - issues affecting year-to-year changes:
1) Cooperative agreement (CA) and technology investment agreement (TIA) five-year funding profiles for each of eight institutes are not straight-line funded in each year, but instead are incrementally increased and then decreased across five fiscal years, with the third year being the peak year. This profile leverages the ability to optimally attain matching funds from industry and academia partners for R&amp;D projects.
2) The number of institutes changed from six in FY 2016 to eight in FY 2017.  
3) FY 2016 and FY 2017 are the peak funding years supporting establishment of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes, with significant annual decreases programmed annually thereafter.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DMS&amp;T investment strategy follows a two-pronged approach built on: 1) broad technology initiatives  and 2) specific individual projects meeting more focused manufacturing technology needs.  Investments in both cases are built and managed in collaboration with the Department’s research, development and acquisition (RDA) communities (including active, ongoing coordination with the DoD ManTech Program’s Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel) and industry and target the development of defense-essential advanced manufacturing processes and associated workforce capabilities.  The portfolio includes a focus on above-the-shop-floor new manufacturing processes and practices having the potential to improve manufacturing efficiencies at broader, enterprise levels. Single specific projects address investment opportunities not associated with selected technology initiatives and enable the program to more surgically apply investments to compelling and sometimes urgent manufacturing needs.
 			
Data calls are launched through two methods to identify technology initiatives and single specific issues requiring investment.  One method is through the JDMTP.  The JDMTP is comprised of the ManTech Directors from the Services, Defense Logistics Agency, and Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The call is distributed through the ManTech Directors to the four JDMTP sub panels: Metals Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Composites Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, Electronics Processing and Fabrication Subpanel, and Advanced Manufacturing Enterprise Subpanel. Potential candidates are evaluated by the JDMTP based on criteria set forth in the call and announcements, and then down-selected for further development prior to final selection.  The other method is through funding opportunity announcements to industry.  Priority is given to investments that support affordability and producibility of critical enabling manufacturing technologies that cut across multiple platforms.  Investments also balance defense priorities in specialty materials, electronics, propulsion and power, and manufacturing processes including "above the shop floor" (lean and business technologies facilitating interoperable manufacturing).  Final projects are selected by the OSD ManTech Director, considering input from the JDMTP,and as approved by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP).  Technology initiatives and projects are executed at the Component level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Advanced Electronics and Optics is a series of efforts addressing advanced manufacturing technologies for a wide range of applications such as sensors, radars, power generation, switches, and optics for defense applications.  Focal points are productivity and efficiency gains in the defense manufacturing base to accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations, and manufacturing technologies to reduce the cost, acquisition time and risk of our major defense acquisition programs. Future efforts will focus on advances in fuel cells, lasers, enhanced acuity microdisplays, and transparent ceramics for opto-mechanical and armor applications.

The Transparent Ceramic Initiative will address DoD applications for electro-optics, including fibers, films, and bulk solid state components, such as windows. Typical materials include: sapphire, ALON, and spinel. Transparent ceramics offer the potential for improved ballistic strength for battlefield armor and personnel protection. Investments include but are not limited to: high strength spinel scale-up, Nanocomposite Optical Ceramics (NCOC) powder scale-up, infrared windows, and curved transparent ceramics. 

Projects:

Mini Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Expedite the transition of 10 um (TEC)-less SWIR cameras to the warfighter and develop wafer level processing techniques to improve yield and reduce contaminants in the SWIR focal plane array (FPA)/ camera assembly. Will establish the industrial base for SWIR technology systems and components. Reduced unit cost allows more individuals to carry imagers; 6x improved cost, reduced from $30K to $5K; 3x reduced size from 3cm3 to 1cm3; 3x reduced weight from 120 g to 40 g. Applications include COSI, INOD, COS3, AWST, Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), IDNST, PAWS, and MTS-B.

Mini Vis - SWIR Cameras and Imagers (FY 2016): Develop a manufacturing capability to produce one camera that can see the entire spectral band of Visible, Near Infrared (NIR), and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR); while being compatible with visible, NIR, and SWIR laser pointers and illuminators. Applications include: COSI, INOD, COS3, Advanced Weapon Sight Technology (AWST), Joint Effect Targeting System (JETS), Integrated Day/Night Sight Technology (IDNST), PAWS, and Multispectral Targeting System (MTS-B).

Key focus areas include direct digital (or additive) manufacturing, advanced manufacturing enterprise, machining, robotics, assembly, and joining.  Projects selected will accelerate delivery of technical capabilities to impact current warfighting operations while reducing cost, acquisition time, and risk of major defense acquisition programs.

It is paramount for the U.S. military to improve its own agility and flexibility. The focus is to find a solution to overcome a burdensome acquisition cycle requiring a great amount of cost, time, security, and storage space. Through the use of secure satellite data links or a local parts database, warfighters can access computer-aided design (CAD) for replacement parts, allowing them to repair equipment without the need to establish supply chains or wait for shipments. It allows operators to modify a part's design based on its performance in the field.

Emerging manufacturing technologies undergoing development include:  a large-scale challenge for advanced, interoperable machine tool applications, and methods for exchange of 3D official technical data throughout the supply chain and between the Government and contractors.

Projects:

Securing American Manufacturing (SAM) (FY 2016): develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities. Applications span the US Defense Industrial Base.
Cyber Security for the Shop Floor - Phase II (FY 2017-2018): The manufacturing factory floor is a growing area of concern for DoD cyber security because defense contractors throughout the DoD's supply chain are continually targeted by cyber criminals seeking to: 1) steal technical data, including critical national security information and valuable commercial intellectual property; 2) alter data, thereby affecting processes and products; and 3) impair or deny process control, thereby damaging or shutting down operations. Protecting the operational systems of a manufacturing enterprise presents a different set of challenges from protecting enterprise IT systems and networks.  This phase II project will develop a Trusted and Assured supply chain, identify threat vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, provide input to DoD policies, and shape follow-on investment to mitigate threat vulnerabilities.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Technological innovation and leadership in manufacturing are essential to sustaining the foundations of economic competitiveness to maintain technological advantage and global dominance for our military. To support these goals, Manufacturing USA institutes, each led by non-profit 501(c) entities, have been established by the Department to serve as national assests with headquarters and regional hubs to accelerate technological innovation into commercial applications and concurrently develop the educational competencies and production processes via shared public-private sectors.  Collaborative execution and funding by the Departments of Defense (DoD), Energy (DOE), and Commerce (DoC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the establishment of these Manufacturing USA institutes  will spur industry cost-share for manufacturing innovation and quickly develop a pathway for technology-focused regional hubs for collaboration among government, industry, and academia that will meet critical government and Warfighter needs.  The overall concept of the Manufacturing USA program (previously named the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation until changed in FY16) and the design of its manufacturing innovation institutes are provided in several key federal documents; among them: 1) the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) report by the Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office entitled, “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation: A Preliminary Design,” published in January 2013, and more recently, in the following two NSTC reports: 2) ”National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program Strategic Plan” and 3) “National Network for Manufacturing Innovation Annual Report,” both published in February 2016.

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes addressed in this budget is expected to be self-sustaining, without reliance on federal sustainment funding, by the end of the period defined by the respective cooperative agreement (CA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) between the federal government and the non-profit organization leading each institute consortium of members.  This CA/TIA period is typically for five years, with the flexibility to extend the agreement up to two years for the benefit of DoD projects, technical achievement, etc., and to fully leverage the minimum 1:1 cost share.  

Each of the eight DoD-led Manufacturing USA institutes is intended to: 
1) Bring together industry, universities and community colleges, federal agencies, and state and local governments and organizations to create regionally-based but nationally-impactful public-private partnerships underpinning the formation of sustainable manufacturing innovation ecosystems
2) Accelerate innovation to bridge the gap between Research and Development (R&amp;D) and deployment of technological innovations in domestic production of goods
3) Invest in industrially relevant manufacturing technologies with broad applications, accelerating innovation within DoD and across all manufacturing sectors to increase U.S. competitiveness
4) Provide shared assets to help companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment 
5) Create an unparalleled environment to educate and train students and workers in advanced manufacturing skills
6) Focus on maturing the associated manufacturing technologies typically from from Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 4 through 7

The first and second year of each of these new institutes is devoted to establishing a sustainable business model and operations, with continued refinement throughout the full period of the cooperative agreement, including: expanding the institute’s membership base (as appropriate); establishing and solidifying revenue streams (e.g., funding from new R&amp;D activity, membership fees, training and workforce development, certification and licensing, etc.); establishing provisional Executive Council and Technical Advisory committees to execute the business of each institute; finalizing Intellectual Property plans; developing technology roadmaps to inform investment strategies; opening industrial commons to provide for shared resource facilities available to all institute members; initiating workforce training programs in each technology area; establishing complementary relationships between Manufacturing USA institutes; analyzing the U.S. and Global industrial base in partnership with other government agencies to build upon the institute portfolio and address critical requirements; and further developing national technology roadmaps.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Advanced additive manufacturing will benefit the DoD by enabling lifecycle cost savings and enhanced capabilities, including moving toward “focused logistics” – getting the right part in the right place in just the right time – for wartime and humanitarian missions using local supply chains. This Manufacturing USA institutes was established in 2012, with cooperative agreement funding included in this budget through FY 2015, and DoD program management costs included in subsequent fiscal years until all R&amp;D projects, reporting, and fiduciary responsibilities are completed.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This institute is intended to advance state-of-the-art human tissue manufacturing innovations in cell and biomaterial processing, bioprinting, automation and non-destructive testing technologies. The motivation is to increase U.S. competitiveness in advanced tissue biofabrication manufacturing by encouraging insertion of disruptive technologies into multiple biotechnology sectors, streamlining integrated testing technologies and ultimately reducing the barrier to entry for new inventors. The goal is to establish a collaboration that will mature tissue-related technology across a range of manufacturing readiness levels (MRL) 4-7, enabling post-delivery assurance of tissue identity, viability, function, and efficacy. This Institute will bring together the diverse and currently fragmented collection of industry practices and institutional knowledge across many disciplines (cell biology, bioengineering, materials science, analytical chemistry, robotics, and quality assurance). Scaling up to commercial level production of tissues will require manufacturing and process automation suitable for living cells, as well as testing and preservation methods appropriate for tissue-based products with limited shelf-life and a narrow window of efficacy. 

Technical focus at a minimum will be comprised of four thrust areas: 1) Cell &amp; Material Selection &amp; Sourcing;  2) Biofabrication Platforms;  3) Process Design and Automation;  4) Tissue Finishing and Testing Technologies

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each Manufacturing Innovation Institute is established through a competitive selection process.  The executing military department or agency, in close and continuous coordination with OSD ManTech, publishes a formal solicitation (funding opportunity announcement) for proposals describing the scope of required activities and extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations (including universities) are eligible to bid, and each bidder forms a broad consortium of industry and academic partners. The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium.  The final terms of the cooperative agreement/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed.  Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessing the performance of the DoD-led manufacturing institutess, part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program, requires a multi-faceted view of ‘performance,’ given the program’s layered base of DoD, government-wide, and national level public-private stakeholders and interests. Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program’s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014.  Performance relative to both sets of goals/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance.  The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD’s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2)  at the DoD/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:
1.	Impact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem
2.	Financial Leverage/Sustainability
3.	Education and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development 
4.	Technical Advancement
Specific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute’s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

The office, in collaboration with government labs, academia, and industry will execute projects that target specific mission capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Joint Staff and senior leadership in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The ECTD funding supports projects that reduce the technology risk of emerging capabilities by advancing proof-of-principle prototypes in support of near and mid-term operational engagements and stability operations.  The framework is guided by the ASD(R&amp;E), DASD(EC&amp;P), and the Rapid Reaction Technology Office's science and technology objectives and focus areas.  With an emphasis on interagency and joint partnerships, ECTD develops initiatives to produce capability options that anticipate and inform formal joint and interagency requirements and acquisition processes.  Individual projects generally span one to three years, typically at a cost of less than $4.000 million, and are demonstrated and released in spirals within the project timeline.  The ECTD program focuses on rapid prototyping of emerging technologies, including electromagnetic spectrum-agile capability options; multi-domain, autonomous systems; counter-weapons of mass destruction; and dismounted soldier systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Using adaptive manufacturing architectures and three dimensional printers this project iteratively designed, built, and tested a prototype unmanned aerial system (UAS) to demonstrate improvements over conventional manufacturing approaches.  The project allows for iterative prototyping through additive manufacturing to accelerate development by orders of magnitude.  The demonstration platform for this effort is a modular, rapidly designed, and reconfigurable UAS with modules built using additive manufacturing.  The project also includes a system level design tool that allows the user to configure a new vehicle, predict its performance, and automatically generate the flight control laws for a new configuration.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area includes cost-effective, mission-focused projects to design, develop, and rapidly deliver new concepts and technology prototypes aimed at protecting DoD systems and extending capabilities across the electromagnetic spectrum.  In the U.S. and allied nations, Department of Defense (DoD) communication and sensing capabilities are increasingly compromised by spectrum congestion and loss, as is evidenced by the recent radio frequency (RF) spectrum auction and the spectrum relocation fund.  In other operational environments, emergent Electronic Warfare (EW) threats, technologies, and tactics contest the use of RF spectrum and erode U.S. capabilities in ways that are difficult to predict and counteract.  This focus area helps address the dual challenges of anti-access and area denial though spectrum agility that supports the Third Offset Strategy by allowing our forces to operate when and where they are needed.

Prototypes from this focus area will address spectrum sharing, spectrum relocation, and spectrum competition requirements, and will be evaluated under the electromagnetic (EM) conditions expected at home and abroad.  Projects will anticipate emerging EW challenges and explore adaptive, agile solutions.  Potential venues for prototype assessment include Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program, Thunderstorm integration exercises, and multi-domain demonstration venues across the DoD.  Knowledge and experience gained through these demonstrations will help develop new warfighting concepts and inform requirements and technical feasibility of future acquisition programs.  Development of advanced prototypes will involve partnerships with industry, academia, and non-traditional DoD partners.  These initial prototype efforts will help reduce the cost of future acquisition programs and stimulate efforts beyond traditional defense industrial base activities.

Autonomous systems range from software to aid the intelligence analyst in processing, exploitation, and dissemination, through very complex autonomous air systems networked in tandem with unmanned ground or undersea vehicles.  Related capabilities that enable autonomy are multiplying due to sensors that can understand the environment and software algorithms that can make a decision or seek human assistance.  This focus area supports projects that experiment with increased delegation to autonomous systems, pushing commercial and laboratory developments to the warfighter and allowing for faster than human reaction.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  SERDP enhances military operations, improves military systems` effectiveness, enhances military training/readiness, sustains DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and helps ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Congress established the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) in 1990 (10 U.S.C. Section 2901-2904) to address Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) environmental concerns.  It is conducted as a DoD program, jointly planned and executed by the DoD, DOE, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with strong participation by other Federal agencies, industry, and academia.  SERDP`s objective is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and cost-effective technologies in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Resilience, and Weapons Systems and Platforms.  SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements.  Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems’ effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, sustain DoD’s training and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents by eliminating or reducing the generation of pollution and use of hazardous materials and by reducing the cost of remedial actions and compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  As a secondary benefit, SERDP helps solve significant national and international environmental problems.  The keys to a growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on constant technology transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) is a pivotal resource that synchronizes two Department-wide domains, military requirements and acquisition, with shared analyses and actionable assessments.  JWP supports partnership for customers including joint command staffs, the Joint Staff, and OSD elements responsible for oversight of Component programs that equip forces for joint missions. The account underwrites analyses and studies,  limited-scope experiments, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develop actionable requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.   JWP specifically aims to assist joint-end-users by analyses that identify essential capability improvements as actionable joint military needs expressed as specific Key Performance Parameters (KKPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on ways to align Service and Agency investments and potential solutions for capability gaps created by evolving threats not aligned to single Component missions. This program element plays a major role in portfolio assessments aiming to identify critical gaps between Service-generated capabilities and affordable joint solutions. JWP funds venues for demonstration of emergent technology-based prototypes that enable joint customers to draft requirements based on realistic understanding of feasible solutions.   JWP also underwrites staff analyses in the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Working with Service, OSD, the Joint Staff and joint command counterparts, the AT&amp;L staff performs portfolio assessments focusing on joint warfighting environments in the future.   

Typical projects funded with JWP include independent analysis and translation of capability gap assessments into actionable military needs statements, identification of candidate solutions via experimentation, translation of solution concepts into field demonstrations, and remedy of joint capability gaps in partnership with Defense agents for doctrine changes and technology development.  JWP resources support  analytic expertise on joint issues.  In this activity, JWP underwrites small grants to invigorate employment of experimentation and analysis, to formulate strategies to resolve joint capability gaps, and to stimulate participation in the Department enterprises for joint experimentation and joint capability development.  JWP resources also supportthe development of tools supporting joint analytic efforts. 
The  JWP funds contributes resources to examination of potential remedies for joint mission capability gaps.  In many cases, JWP funds initiatives for process improvements serving all Components, but aligned with no single Service or Agency.  These early assessments and studies of potential capability gap solutions can accelerate engineering development, subsequent field experiments, and capability demonstrations in field conditions.  JWP often represents the first effort to define integrated and innovative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities through cross-cutting analysis and studies in partnership with  the OSD staffs serving AT&amp;L, Policy and with elements of the Joint Staff.  It evolves analytic development of Joint Military Requirements addressing evolving threats / missions On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This segment underwrites innovative, responsive and timely analytic development of Joint Military requirements addressing evolving missions and threats.  It supports joint capability development serving the needs of joint warfighters in partnership with senior acquisition staffs.  It provides an independent source to examine potential remedies for mission capability gaps and can establish a framework for subsequent field experiments, capability demonstrations or accelerated acquisition.  Joint warfare independent analysis often represents the first effort to define alternative solutions across the range of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Personnel-Facilities.    On a modest funding base, JWP forges collaborative analysis efforts across OSD and joint staffs to address  tough DoD-wide issues like ISR, cyber, EW and UAS.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is a key to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD’s) increasing demand for high-quality, affordable, and timely national defense systems.  Systemic software issues are significant contributors to poor program execution. Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net-based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the January 2017 Defense Science Board Report, “Defense Research Enterprise Assessment,” software, autonomy, and cyber are today’s core challenges. With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to avoid strategic surprise.  

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The SEI’s program of work coordinates across the DoD through Reliance 21, the overarching framework of the DoD’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) joint planning and coordination process.  This PE benefits every Community of Interest (COI) to some degree due to the ubiquitous nature of software, but particularly benefits: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) which includes a computing and software sub-panel; Autonomy; Cyber; and Engineered Resilient Systems.  

Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large-scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  To address this, the PE funds research and development within the SEI Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).

The SEI FFRDC is the DoD’s primary source for software research and development.  It is an institute which enables the exploitation of emerging software technology by bringing engineering, management, and security discipline to software acquisition, development, and evolution.  The SEI FFRDC focuses on software technology areas judged to be of the highest payoff in meeting defense needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management. 

This program has two main research thrusts with known military applications: 1) Software Engineering, Systems Verification and Validation, and Mission Assurance (formerly Mission Assurance) and 2) Information Assurance and Cyber Security.

SEI research focuses on the most significant and pervasive software and cybersecurity challenges within the DoD, such as the scalability and reliability of software assurance, supply chain risk management, validation of and trust in autonomous systems, human-computer and human-technology interaction, computing and communication at the tactical edge, and efficiency and performance of acquisition strategies and software development appropriate for a contested cyber environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This research seeks to develop and rapidly prototype techniques to verify methods for identifying requirements, systems of systems architectures, and virtual integration of components.  Furthermore, research in this area will pursue rapid prototyping and transitioning of capabilities that verify requirements for software assurance, analysis/control of unverified code and automated repair of damaged code. Software production and code analysis methods developed through this program will also improve the ability to predict how complex software systems will behave in untested environments. Increasingly, large numbers of lines of code will require a commensurate increase in sophisticated verification and validation mechanisms.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The QRSP Program Element develops risk-reducing prototypes and conducts demonstrations designed to develop capabilities in anticipation of emerging adversary threats, while addressing immediate Combatant Commands (CCMD) needs.  QRSP efforts support the Department’s goal to provide a hedge against technical uncertainty by acting as an incubator for developing potentially game-changing capabilities and by fostering collaboration among other government agencies, DoD laboratories, academia, and the commercial sector.  DoD’s strategy recognizes a return to a more competitive environment with resurgence of near-peer competitors and adversaries who have studied and worked to counter U.S. technological capabilities.  QRSP provides an agile mechanism to affordably counter emerging technological threats and help maintain the United States’ competitive advantage.  Specifically, QRSP enables the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) to anticipate and respond to emergent DoD issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the building blocks for the Third Offset Strategy, Reliance 21, the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan, and CCMD Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).  QRSP efforts field new capabilities at low cost and in short time-frames, inform the requirements process, and inject innovative technologies into programs of record.  The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Cell support.  Focus areas within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, including counter anti-access/area denial; counter weapons of mass destruction; target identification and tracking; surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance; low-cost precision engagement; counter-electronic warfare; and, autonomous systems.

The QRF Program objectives are to develop prototypes in response to emergent conventional warfare needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies.  The QRF is executed by the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  QRF projects focus on force protection to enhance anti-access and area denial capabilities, broad electronic warfare capabilities, mitigating hardware and software vulnerabilities, and autonomous learning systems for processing and analyzing intelligence streams.  QRF initiates projects during the execution year and focuses on maturing technologies critically needed for the CCMDs by producing prototypes for demonstration and evaluation.  QRF projects typically advance  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) four to five technologies to transition them to an end user or CCMD at a TRL of seven or higher with a total project duration of 12 months.  The QRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).
 
The RRF Program objectives, executed by RRTO, are to develop proof-of-principle prototypes to counter emerging irregular warfare threats, anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies, and expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives support the DoD Research and Engineering Enterprise mission to develop, demonstrate, assess, and rapidly field innovative concepts and technologies that supply critical capabilities to meet time-sensitive operational needs.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as advanced algorithms and software intelligence, to enable virtual prototyping with agile capability delivery and technology insertion.  RRTO leverages our traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses to address DoD needs as identified by CCMD, Military Service organizations, other Defense organizations, and interagency partners.  Typical RRF programs are 6 to 18 months in duration and aim to mature a capability to demonstration.  The RRF consistently exceeds the transition objective of 40 percent for demonstration programs (DoD Strategic Objective 3.5.2D).       

The JRAC Program objectives focus on responding to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEONS) that have been submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  In addition, the JRAC’s objectives are to manage the delivery of capabilities as requested by the CCMD in a timeframe acceptable to the CCMD.  Efforts, in most instances, use contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.

The SMA Cell objective is to support all CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the United States Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems that inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA Cell programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy for Operations.  Products are typically generated within six months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD's senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QSRP) Program supports four separate project codes that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of new prototypical technologies to the warfighter.  The QSRP Program provides the flexibility and agility to mitigate emerging threats and address needs that arise faster than the two-year budget cycle. 

The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) Program provides the Services, components, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and force providers opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies to rapidly develop and field-test promising new proof-of-principle prototypes that can have immediate impact on time-sensitive operational needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.

The QRF Program focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs through rapidly developed and fielded hardware.  More specifically, the QRF Program includes initiatives that serve to maintain a technical advantage over potential adversaries and reduce technical risk barriers in the following interest areas: counter anti-access and area denial capabilities; base protection; electromagnetic bandwidth and spectrum enhancement; persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; newly emerging national threats; human-machine collaborative decision making; and, counter-electronic warfare technologies.  

In FY 2017 and FY 2018, the QRF Program will continue to identify and fund new, rapidly developed prototypes and technology demonstrations that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  Investments are made in the execution year for agile response to Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities.

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
• Columbia:  This project is an electronic countermeasure system designed to address a specific threat to U.S. forces.  Details are classified.  The Columbia effort delivered a size, weight, and power (SWaP) assessment and laboratory electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC) analysis of a sustainable, maintainable, self-contained capability that will mitigate the effects of an attack by an overwhelming number of threats - individually or simultaneously.  Columbia transitioned to the Air Force in 2016. 
• Dark Storm:  This project successfully developed and fielded low-cost, innovative space situational awareness (SSA) capabilities.  Data collected from six remote sites was transferred and consolidated at a central site to provide increased SSA.  The full capability transitioned to a classified customer.
• Deer Hunting:  As a follow-on to the initial prototype, this project automated a proven target discovery process that was demonstrated for the National Security Agency (NSA).  The automation allowed Deer Hunting to scale and transition to other projects using a target agnostic approach.  The classified capability transitioned to U.S. Central Command and other missions within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community.  
• Interruption of Wide-Area Sensing Capability (IWAS):  Persistent, wide-area surveillance capabilities threaten U.S. Navy open-ocean supremacy.  The IWAS project developed an electronic attack technique effective against wide-area surveillance sensors to disrupt their kill-chain.  The project successfully demonstrated the electronic attack capability before transitioning it to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to support development of specific applications.

                                                    <r2:Description>Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) technology was designed to determine if and when there is speech in a captured signal to dramatically increase the efficiency and speed of communications intelligence (COMINT) signals analysis.  Once speech has been detected, the technology can identify speakers, languages, and keywords in real time across multiple channels.  The focus of this effort is to support counter Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) missions.  Transition partner applications integrate RATS technology with digital receiver platforms to automatically alert an analyst to new channels of interest, determine if a channel should be transmitted to the ground, scan other frequencies for desired signals, and control a digital receiver to dwell on the given channel.  This project is a collaboration with Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office (PMA-290), focusing on near-term deployment and follow-on integration on Navy signals intelligence platforms.</r2:Description>

RATS significantly increases analyst effectiveness while reducing the load on personnel analyzing incoming signals, allowing them to focus on the most relevant data and not the discovery of new speech signals that are difficult to manually find.  There are currently not enough personnel, bandwidth, or aircraft to manually process all signals of interest for relevant speech, leading to important information being lost or ignored.  In FY 2017, RATS will operationally deploy in support of U.S. Central Command and transition to Naval Air Systems Command Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a trusted systems strategy that is based upon mission assurance, comprehensive protection planning, industry standards and advancing DoD's capability to identify and mitigate HW/SW vulnerabilities through automated techniques and tools.  This project supports research and development focus to coordinate and improve capabilities to current and future programs in acquisition, operational systems and infrastructure to improve availability.

These HW/SW Assurance projects directly support all elements in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 937.  It provides funding for the Department's capabilities to federate existing HW/SW assurance expertise, capabilities and facilities within the Services and Agencies, to address existing gaps, as well as emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  The Federation detects, assesses, and prioritizes critical mission vulnerabilities to malicious software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities, promulgate findings, and mitigate critical vulnerabilities in both SW and HW.

This program established the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) which provides federation of hardware and software assurance expertise and capabilities to support program needs.  Capabilities developed and demonstrated are transitioned in the Trusted and Microelectronics Program Elements 0604294D8Z BA4 and 0605294D8Z BA5, and enhance the hardware assurance capabilities of the JFAC.</r2:Description>

These projects will employ current hardware coupled with custom chemistries, data analysis algorithms, software, databases, and information transmission pipelines to enable more comprehensive analysis of trace, degraded, and mixed DNA samples.  This comprehensive data analysis allows for correlating individual activities and histories; the ability to determine biogeographical ancestry; increasing confidence in assigning extended kinship identifications; and, greater accuracy in predicting phenotypic attributes such as facial characteristics, eye colors, skin tones/variations, or physical deformities.  This focus area also includes support for HTS databases that are designed to ingest large DNA data flows efficiently, use processing power for searching and analyzing big data, and employ big data analytics to make predictive assessments that would otherwise go unnoticed.  This focus area will encourage collaboration on biometrics and forensics projects within the DoD, with interagency partners, with our partners in industry and academia, and with international partners where applicable.  This collaboration will help maximize shared investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

The goal of the mixture deconvolution is to allow for the identification of individual profiles from mixed samples with up to eight contributors.  It will also explore the ability to identify common contributors across multiple mixtures.  The low-copy project will attempt to extend the sensitivity of current sequencing technologies from a minimum sample size of over 100 picograms (approximately 12 human cells) down to less than 50 picograms.  It will also work on protocols to analyze environmentally degraded samples.  The bioinformatics platform will provide a comprehensive user interface to current HTS platforms.  Finally, the program will initiate two feasibility studies.  The first will assess the potential costs and pitfalls in investing in efforts to determine appearance (notably head and face shape) through DNA.  The second will investigate how to identify if a DNA sample was modified or ‘spoofed’ to help ensure database integrity.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program supports four separate project codes that provide rapid funding to expedite development and transition of needed capabilities to the warfighter.  The QRSP Program provides the flexibility and agility to mitigate emerging threats and support current operations, including counter terrorism, by addressing needs that arise faster than the two-year budget cycle.  

The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) is fully executed through the Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  RRTO was established to accelerate the development and transition of high-potential science and technology (S&amp;T) projects through operationally useful virtual and proof-of-principle prototypes within the execution year of an identified need.  The RRTO leverages the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T base and those of the other federal agencies, academia, and industry.  The office also stimulates interagency coordination and cooperation, expedites delivery of prototype capabilities and concepts to counter anticipated and emerging threats, and provides feedback to the S&amp;T community to guide long term development strategies.  RRTO achieves this by anticipating adversaries' exploitation of technology, including available and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responding to new threats and opportunities.  Projects support high level Department strategies and objectives, such as the building blocks for the Third Offset Strategy, the Defense Innovation Initiative, and geographic Combatant Command (CCMD) priorities.  Prototypes delivered and transitioned to operational users by RRTO demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and increase ‘speed to market’ by providing cost effective capabilities faster than typical acquisition cycles.

In prior years, RRTO, through RRF, explored novel methods and new approaches for persistent surveillance for counter-insurgency; developed alternate power sources for sensors and systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; advanced the interface between law enforcement and military operations; developed advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing emerging technologies.   

In FY 2017 and FY 2018, RRF will continue to provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and developing near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  RRF projects support goals from the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping).  With project selection occurring during the execution year, the RRF’s current focus areas include: open source data analysis; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization; prototypes for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; additive manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; maritime technologies; and, wargaming for emerging threats and capabilities.   

The typical length of an RRTO project falls within a 6 to 18 month range to more effectively respond to Warfighter needs.

The IO objectives were to disrupt the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) leadership’s ability to command and control forces; neutralize their ability to maintain or increase moral, political, and financial support; prevent recruitment of foreign fighters; and, ultimately, to psychologically isolate ISIL leadership.  The effort assessed the value of ‘integrated neuro-cognitive-narrative maneuver’ approaches to produce messages that are more likely to have intended effects and less likely to have undesirable, unintended, or collateral effects.  The effort also sought to deliver messages more effectively and efficiently by developing campaigns that undercut adversary effects (e.g. leadership fragmentation, organizational fracture, separating population from the organization) and achieve positive coalition effects.  The results of the ‘proof-of-concept’ were presented to the Army Strategic Land Power Task Force.  The task force is continuing to expand options identified by SMA.

At the request of the Commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the SMA stood up a reach back support cell to respond to questions generated by the Command.  The SMA efforts are designed to respond rapidly (days to weeks) to population focused requests from Commanders in the region, provide feedback regarding the impact from potential options, and provide inputs on messaging and counter-messaging options.  This will entail maintaining the current subject matter expert and technical teams as part of a reach back cell.  Options will be evaluated by qualitative assessments including subject matter expert elicitation and quantitative assessments, including modeling and simulation.  Annually, the reach back cell will respond to 10-15 questions from the senior Combatant Command leadership.</r2:Text>

The overall goal of these projects is to reduce future operational risk to warfighters.  New technologies demonstrated through this program will allow warfighters to identify bad actors or counter adversaries’ attempts to mitigate our current technologies.  These projects leverage techniques such as proof-of-principle prototyping, increased use of small businesses, and increased competition between vendors.  Biometrics and forensics projects will mature emerging technologies that support identity operations and forensic capabilities required by Commanders and warfighters in ongoing and future military activities.  These efforts leverage the Reliance 21 model to encourage collaboration on biometrics and forensics projects within the DoD, with interagency partners, with our partners in industry and academia, and with international partners where applicable.  This model will help maximize collaborative investment and prevent redundant research.  Deliverables are shared throughout the biometrics and forensics communities.</r2:Description>

Biometric successes include a pilot capability of the first-ever rules-based classified biometric matching system; The Victim Identification for Disaster Assistance (VIDA) tool, a mobile phone application to support DoD and partner nations’ post-disaster activities such as helping to reunite displaced personnel and families, tracking emergency medical and humanitarian services, and identifying victims; and, the final phases of technology transfer for the Biometric Enabled Watch List (BEWL) Dissemination Management Server, which improved the speed of delivering customized biometric watchlists by 38 times while also significantly reducing errors.  These prototypes transitioned to DoD and other partners including the Army’s Program Manager-Biometrics and the Services through the Pacific Disaster Fund.

The forensics portfolio developed two successful prototypes.  In FY 2016, RRTO demonstrated a new capability to identify the make and model of an imaging device (camera, video recorder, etc.) from the digital image it produced.  The portfolio also developed a new mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) prototype that greatly increased the ability to perform kinship analysis on extremely degraded DNA samples, facilitating identification of over 1,200 remains of fallen Service members from prior conflicts.  These prototypes transitioned to DoD and other partners including the Army’s Defense Forensics Science Center, Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other agencies.</r2:Text>

The first capability will be a handheld, rapid, automatic explosive detector called ExploDisk.  This device will not only check for the presence of seven common explosives, its novel use of cellphone camera technology will mitigate human error in color determination; a common weakness with current technologies.  This capability can also support the identification of illegal drugs by using different disposable analysis ‘chips’.  The second capability is a novel DNA analysis protocol that will extend kinship analysis from the current limit of second generation (grandparents or siblings) to the fourth generation (great-great grandparents or cousins).  This capability is critical to support the identification of remains lost from World War II and Korea as their direct relations may die before the service members’ remains are located.  The final effort leverages FY 2016 funds to finish development and deliver an advanced file carving system.  This system will accelerate the extraction and categorization of files of interest from large data stores while simultaneously screening out useless junk files.  Depending on the file types, this carver will accelerate the process 25 percent to 80 percent over prior carving systems.</r2:Text>

The portfolio will continue work on four projects schedule for FY 2018 delivery.  The program’s Face Acquisition Recognition of IDentities (FAR-ID) project will work toward developing technologies that can accurately perform unconstrained face matching out to 800 meters, greatly expanding the ability to detect and categorize potential threats before they can do harm to U.S. Forces.  The portfolio is also co-funding three digital forensic projects.  The first project will develop and demonstrate a software prototype that will allow analysts to identify linkages to related data on other devices or cloud servers used by the devices’ owner.  The Forensic Acquisition Tool for Cloud-Based Data software prototype will allow analysts to extract data from cloud-based service providers in a forensically sound manner.  This tool will help analysts maintain data validity prior to analysis.  The third project will develop a prototype to identify hand writing on scanned documents containing background images or text.  This tool is the first step in developing an automated method of analyzing handwritten documents.  Projects for biometrics and forensics portfolios will be selected after coordination throughout DoD and across other U.S. Government departments and agencies to maximize collaborative investment and prevent unnecessary redundant research.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>To date, rapid DNA analysis systems have relied on pneumatics and mechanical valves for microfluidic movement which results in bulky hardware and assay times greater than 60 minutes.  The FaSTR DNA instrument exploits centrifugally-driven microfluidics to eliminate mechanical valves and pressure-driven flow, and allows commercial off the shelf electronics to facilitate sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction, and integration with electrophoresis (the movement of charged particles in a fluid or gel under the influence of an electric field).  This paradigm shift for microfluidic technology radically reduces the form factor, analysis time, and cost of the system.  The FaSTR project will produce the first truly portable, rapid DNA analysis instrument capable of generating DNA profiles from “sample in” to “answer out” in less than 30 minutes and provide a match probability of 1 in 55 billion people.</r2:Description>

Additionally, the project combined all three DNA processing steps onto the integrated analysis chip and demonstrated the device’s ability to produce an accurate DNA profile in less than 60 minutes.</r2:Text>

                                                    <r2:Description>ISR sensors are critical for providing asymmetric compensation against larger, near-peer adversaries.  However, ISR systems span a wide range of sensing modalities and generally produce very large data sets that are difficult to analyze, which challenges rapid innovation in response to emerging threats.  Efforts in this focus area will increase speed to market for better sensors and tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  Projects include improved surveillance sensors, tools to facilitate analysis of large data sets, methods to harvest meaningful intelligence from open and classified sources, and establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities.  RRF sponsored prototypes will facilitate integration of advance ISR capabilities into new and existing systems.  These prototypes will help increase the effectiveness of ISR architectures and reduce the human analyst requirements to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area will develop the enabling capabilities and key technologies required to advance additive manufacturing technology to meet specific warfighter needs.  Additive manufacturing projects are those that use processes in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control to create functional three dimensional products.  Additive manufacturing allows for rapid prototyping and iterative innovation, removing barriers for technology insertion.  Due to increased speed from design to prototype, reduced cost, and reduced waste additive manufacturing provides a unique supporting capability for the Third Offset Strategy.  Additive manufacturing capabilities are rapidly developing in industry and other government agencies.  The Rapid Reaction Technology Office will leverage commercial innovation and emerging capabilities of the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia to develop proof-of-principle prototypes focused on warfighter needs.  Projects include spare part replacement, jet engine repair, custom hardware enclosures, and three-dimensional (3-D) models.  Projects have the potential to significantly reduce the supply chain inefficiencies by storing parts as software and manufacturing on demand, and using rapid prototyping to reduce time and cost of design.  Projects can also reduce amount of labor required to produce functioning prototypes.  Deliverables will inform enhancement decisions and concept of operations development.</r2:Description>

With input from across the U.S. Government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA Cell develops options to CCMD-generated challenging problems and informs the command's senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior CCMDleadership.  Priorities for SMA problems are set by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations.  Products are typically produced within six months and directly contribute to the decision making process of CCMD's senior leaders.

The effort evaluates strategic risks and identifies knowledge gaps to provide an increased understanding of potential security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  USEUCOM subsequently asked SMA to apply the same methodology to identify emerging Russian threats and opportunities in Eurasia.

Specifically, if the U.S. Government is to respond effectively to the threats and opportunities presented in the increasingly gray security environment, it requires a more detailed map of the space between peace and war than it currently possesses.  The project provided a more rigorous and comprehensive articulation of the space between militarized conflict and peace.  The project team conducted a quantitative analysis of historical examples of gray conflicts and contemporary manifestations and geopolitical drivers.  The team assessed specific U.S. experience with ‘Gray Zone’ conflicts and what strategies and tactics have been most and least successful as instruments of U.S. policy.  The team also explored conceptual, procedural, and physical capabilities necessary for navigating this gray space.  The SMA team identified how the various elements of power need to be coordinated to effectively respond to ‘Gray Zone’ conflicts.  For example, by examining the interests, resources, and capabilities of violent extremist organizations and transnational criminal organizations in ‘Gray Zone’ regions.  The SMA team also investigated how violent non-state actors (VNSAs)/violent extremist organizations (VEOs) and state actors create ‘Gray Zones’ differently.  The SMA team employed a variety of empirical approaches to this effort, involving simulation, geospatial, case-study, and statistical methodologies.  Products from the effort have been provided to USSOCOM, and all other CCMDs.</r2:Text>

The cell will continue to actively collaborate with CCMD senior leadership and the Joint Staff leadership to identify challenging problems that are not within the traditional areas of DoD expertise.  These problems will help increase our understanding of ‘Gray Zone’ conflicts and identify potential responses.  USSOCOM is leveraging these efforts to support a senior leader forum on ‘Gray Zone’ indications and warnings and USEUCOM has established a Russian deterrence effort that benefits from SMA’s work.  Additional products will directly support other CCMDs and government agencies.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and address complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.

M&amp;S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&amp;S, enhances the DoD M&amp;S Enterprise by (1) enabling cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&amp;S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&amp;S.

SERC is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to further systems research and increase its impact on the Department’s ability to meet its mission.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, flexible, and ready for a full range of contingencies in the face of declining budgets and a shrinking workforce.  The SERC consists of a network of 23 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for achieving more affordable and mission-resilient warfighting systems designed within a shorter time frame by conducting research and development and new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, modeling capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.  These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that enables advanced knowledge management and multi-community collaboration, including data retention and lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) improves design agility and cost-effectiveness during analysis and development leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, and fielding of mission-effective and adaptable systems. Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that will integrate physics-based models and engineering tools across acquisition disciplines to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, iteratively optimize designs and improve architectures to reduce or eliminate sensitivity to adversary tactics and capability improvements, and adapt those designs over time. The goal is to achieve a vitally-needed transformation in the contribution of Defense systems engineering to design resilience and effectiveness across the systems lifecycle. These engineering improvements are essential to address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.

ERS research and development focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools within an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes.   These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration.  ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased/easier utilization of High Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to stay in pace with evolving weapons technologies.  This program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion. The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the S&amp;T Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Progress was made toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope. Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The HAPCAT project continued to develop and demonstrate air delivery system technologies to provide uniform flow with variable pressure and temperature through a nozzle up to Mach 7.5 conditions.  The project activities included initiation of Phase 2 beginning fabrication of the air delivery system and conceptual design of a full scale facility. 
  Efforts continued on the morphing ceramic components for hypersonic ground test facilities project which seeks to achieve a variable Mach number capability and variable inlet distortion patterns representative of flight-like inlet systems.  Testing to validate direct-connect hardware designs were completed at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). This technology promises to provide a significant advantage over current rigid, stationary facility hardware by providing a “first-ever” realistic variable Mach flight distortion simulation test capability, while reducing costs and increasing productivity.
  The large-scale scramjet engine test techniques project accomplishments included continued progress in determining the capability of existing ground test facilities and methodologies to evaluate and develop large-scale hypersonic propulsion systems.  Testing of the semi-freejet test configuration utilizing an advanced hydrocarbon fueled missile scale scramjet completed. Analysis comparing tests between the larger and smaller facilities allowed the optimized utilization of existing facilities and defined the size and type of investments needed for future large-scale scramjet vehicle development and reduction of flight test and acquisition risks.
  Construction of the Large Energy National Shock Tunnel II extension was completed and evaluated to verify extended run times. Such testing will enable the full development of complex flow features affecting vehicle performance, the determination of control surface responsiveness and effectiveness, and the evaluation of the performance of aerodynamic features. The improvements will help fill a critical test capability gap and support future hypersonic vehicle programs. Initial facility performance assessments of the extended tunnel demonstrated a 3 fold increase in test run time. 
  The HSST project continued development of a mid-pressure arc heater prototype.  The prototype replaced an existing Huels arc heater with a segmented heater, creating a test envelope approximately three times larger than the current envelope for aerothermal testing.  The prototype will provide extended test run time of up to 30 minutes and a higher thermal load representative of that experienced by a hypersonic vehicle TPS. These efforts advanced progress toward the goal of improved T&amp;E of maneuvering reentry and boost/glide vehicles. In a related effort, the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development made significant progress toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  
  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance. Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle. Experimental results acquired through the boundary layer transition effort will be used to validate state of the art prediction tools and measurements of boundary layer transition mechanisms. The project conducted testing in multiple tunnels providing a basis for comparative analysis in different test configurations and comprehensive code validation test cases regarding 3D boundary layer stability and transition.  
  Progress continued toward the development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, oxygen/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development. Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment. Development of an airborne version of the LIDAR began with the initial design and testing of hardware components. 
  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  Preliminary design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft. 
  An Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) based range support study was completed to determine the technical performance and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for a High Altitude, Long Endurance Uncrewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) configured to support flight T&amp;E of hypersonic vehicles.  Telemetry, optical remote sensing, and LIDAR atmospheric measurements instrumentation capabilities were analyzed to estimate the technical performance of each on an airborne platform. The design, fabrication, and installation of a telemetry capability integrated on to a HALE UAS airborne platform for a technical demonstration was initiated.
  Measurements of thermal emissions from the surface of typical boost-glide vehicles in an impulse test facility were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different surface compositions and treatments and filter frequencies for thermal imaging. 
  Advances were achieved in the development of M&amp;S tools. Verification and improvement of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes continued, making use of the unique data sets obtained from the HSST scramjet engines tests and boundary layer experiments.  A validated boundary layer transition prediction tool was released for application to complex, 3D boost-glide vehicle geometries. The code enables prediction and analysis of the characteristics and extent of boundary layer transition on the test article surface resulting from variations in nose bluntness, unit Reynolds number, and angle of attack. 
  The transient thermal analysis software effort completed integration of an aerothermal code and a structural heating code.  The code underwent beta testing by multiple organizations and was released to the hypersonic community to support planning and analysis of flight tests.</r2:Text>

  Progress will continue toward integration and operation of the HAPCAT clean-air, variable Mach number testbed, including the design, fabrication, testing and installation of the air delivery system components. The air delivery system will combine three separate streams of pressurized air, each at different temperatures and pressures, and deliver them to the hypersonic nozzle of the HAPCAT facility.  The air streams are regulated through the air delivery system to produce a specified flight enthalpy (energy) level appropriate for the clean air flight condition being simulated in the test. 
  Upgrades to the Large Energy National Shock Tunnel to increase productivity and accuracy during operation will be initiated. 
  The upgrades to the mid-pressure arc heater will be completed to include the operation of a validated segmented arc heater system. Completion of boundary layer transition efforts will establish a new baseline protocol and recommendations for hypersonic aero performance predictions.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems as well as between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L and S frequency bands are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including a three-fold increase in available bandwidth, but C-Band comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size and weight) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  DoD’s strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  
  A non-blocking Ethernet switch for airborne applications was demonstrated showing 10 gigabit Ethernet data speeds required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements. Once ruggedized, this technology will serve as the network backbone which will tie all onboard instrumentation together with the onboard test data transmitter. SET matured technology to enable more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry transceiver.  Development continued on a multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced waveforms.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.  Technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network was further matured.  This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur. Technology enabling the compression of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) data was further matured. 
  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was developed.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.  
  The SET project initiated an effort to develop a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule.</r2:Text>

The development of an Ethernet switch for airborne applications will continue.  Technology enabling the compression of PCM data will be further matured. Efforts to develop spectrum management tools to optimize the use of available RF spectrum and accurately quantify RF spectrum usage on DoD test ranges will continue.
  The SET project will transition technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of long range missiles including hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna with a modular digital beam-forming controller will be integrated into a Global Hawk and used to support over-the-horizon telemetry requirements for a Navy hypersonic flight test in FY 2017.
  The SET project will initiate development of a steerable, multi-band antenna for airborne platforms.  This antenna technology will employ either mechanical or digital methods to point the telemetry link to a specific ground receive antenna. The pointing of the telemetry link will enable spectrum reuse through spatial diversity, enabling two test platforms to transmit test data within the same portion of RF spectrum.  The SET project will initiate development of radio technology that can utilize alternate spectrum in the upper frequency bands.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

EWT completed efforts to develop a technology for testing directed IR countermeasures (DIRCM) and common IR countermeasures (CIRCM) systems in realistic, high clutter environments. EWT completed and demonstrated a two-color IR scene projector to test two-color, high spatial resolution MWIR sensors.  Work on multi-static radar trackers for testing of HFI systems continued with a demonstration of this technology. Development continued on a wideband multi-beam klystron transmitter for high fidelity threat simulation of next generation RF surface-to-air missiles; the electron gun fabrication and output cavity design completed and a breadboard system was demonstrated in the laboratory environment.  Development of digital RF memory (DRFM) algorithms for generation of virtual radar targets continued with completion of bench testing of hardware and software.  Work continued on using DRFMs to enable chamber testing of data link communications between aircraft.  
  A prototype MWIR scene projector with temperatures in excess of 1500K was developed; this is over a two-fold increase in the prior capability of 700K.  Scene projector development continued toward a 1kHz, two-color scene.  EWT continued design and testing of a prototype wideband multi-beam klystron transmitter for high fidelity threat simulation of next generation RF surface-to-air missile radars.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced TSPI instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.  
  The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during test and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  The AIST project completed development of a model to assess potential impacts of electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by high voltage power lines near DoD test ranges and investigations to mitigate wind turbine effects on DoD test ranges.  Development continued on a passive imaging technology to derive size, shape, mass, drag coefficients, and velocity vectors for individual fragments to quickly characterize the fragment velocity and size distribution in warhead testing.  
  Work continued on radar enabled projectile (e.g., mortar) tracking to provide a measurement rate sufficient to capture the physics of flight for weapon T&amp;E.
  The AIST project continued the development of: technology to provide accurate, dynamic measurements to display posture, head orientation, and respective orientations of warfighters and their equipment; classifiers to identify specific sea mammals (e.g., various dolphin and whale species) found at undersea ranges and the automated processing and display of mammal detections; a personnel tracking system using amplitude modulation (AM) band signals; and technology to evaluate back face deformation of body armor from a blunt trauma event.
  Work continued on a technology to enable a capability for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another platform in real time.  This will improve ship safety during tests and allow for more controlled two-body T&amp;E events involving conventional sea platforms as well as autonomous underwater vehicles.</r2:Text>

TSPI technologies will be further developed to support: data collection in GPS-denied environments with a focus toward data fusion from disparate sensors, TSPI on high dynamic systems such as missiles and projectiles, and Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA).
  Advanced sensor initiatives for non-intrusive applications will include multimodal transducers, and self-registering/self-calibrating sensors.  Sensing applications will include weapon system orientation, body armor blunt trauma evaluation, air launched stores separation, and weapon angle of incidence measurement at impact.  Advanced data transformation initiatives will develop technologies for adaptive computing, virtual/synthetic instrumentation, data compression, wireless on-board data transport and improved data storage density.  Other areas of investigation will include micro-miniaturization of electronic components for non-intrusive applications.  AIST will continue to investigate technologies for mitigating range environmental encroachment issues such as alternative energy interference with range tracking systems.  Additional efforts will include human performance measurement and assessment, specifically human interaction with unmanned systems and the evaluation of the interaction of the warfighter and weapons/equipment and interactions between individual warfighters in team-based holistic assessments.
  The AIST project will complete technologies to measure: fragment characteristics from warhead testing; TSPI using distinctive near-field patterns from AM signals; and mental effort of warfighters during test events.   AIST will demonstrate a capability for in-water vehicles to recognize their position relative to another in-water platform in real time.  AIST will demonstrate automated processing and displaying of marine mammal locations on DoD sea ranges.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects. The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  Work continued on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based technology to characterize atmospheric profiles along a slant path adjacent to the HEL beam propagation path in a maritime environment.  This technology enables real-time determination of the maritime atmospheric aerosol extinction profile from land or a moving ship.  
  Development of non-intrusive dielectric voltage probes capable of measuring high voltage pulses and potentials was completed in support of measurements during HPM engagements including testing of electrical static discharge weapons used for C-IED applications. 
  DET completed development and field demonstration of a radome that will allow more reliable operation of the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Wide Band Threat Source over nine bands of operation enabling more robust testing of U.S. systems against HPM threats. DET transitioned a compact hard tube vircator (CHTV) to the Air Force.  The CHTV project developed an HPM source which will be used for in-chamber testing of HPM effects required for MIL-STD 464C testing. 
  An effort was initiated to mature a dense plasma focus technology to produce strategically relevant ultra-short pulse neutron fluence levels in support of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) Pulsed Neutron Environment project.  These efforts address nuclear vulnerability testing.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C4I) &amp; Software Intensive Systems Test (C4T) project is pursuing test technologies to emulate net-centric military operations in a system-of-systems test environment.  This emulation supports analysis and evaluation of the increasing collection of structured and unstructured data generated by complex military test environments.  The technology to conduct T&amp;E on software intensive systems is required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g., target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.  
  The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester’s ability to effectively conduct rapid analysis of “Big Data” and automated test reporting.  C4T advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL)laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and command and control systems accessing and providing information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These policy-based access controls support end user authentication; enforcement of the defined access control policy prior to joining the TENA execution; and the automatic distribution of the required certificates, keys, and login tokens. The C4T project completed development of technologies that apply automated analysis of large net-centric systems data sets using cloud computing technologies in support of testing the F-35 and aircraft weapons separation testing.
  Development continued on technologies to provide an acoustic propagation model of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance operating in various maritime tactical environments.  Specifically, a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments. This technology is targeted for support of testing the MK-48 and MK-54 torpedoes.
  The C4T project initiated development of technologies to provide a reliable, fast, and cost-effective approach that enables Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) testing of next generation weapon systems.  These technologies will enable live assets to sense and respond to stimulus without regard to whether the stimulus is real or synthetic.</r2:Text>

Moreover, C4T will investigate M&amp;S technologies to support emulation and stimulation of networks for conducting T&amp;E. Technology developments will focus on semantic analysis of large structured and unstructured data sets. These technology developments will include the ability to process unstructured test data into a structured format for analysis using data-to-decision algorithms.
  Further work on the correlation and analysis of “Big Data” from multiple sources will continue. Development of techniques to automate the reuse of knowledge to enable continuous developmental testing throughout the lifecycle of weapon systems will continue.
  The C4T project will develop technologies that mitigate data biases introduced by the test infrastructure.  Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Cross Domain Solution (CDS) technologies will be investigated with the goals of improving the automation of preparing test data for analysis as well as facilitating automated sharing of information across all security enclaves.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and Autonomous Systems (UAS) support every domain of warfare.  They operate in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of unmanned systems brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of these critical warfighting capabilities.  The technology developments within the UAST portfolio have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on science and technology priority investments, particularly in assessing autonomy.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system’s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units and teams of unmanned systems operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The stress testing tool transitioned to the Services to support efficient evaluation of safety-related vulnerabilities in black-box UAS software and automatic detection of safety issues. New efforts focused on test technologies supporting the near term challenges identified in the 2013–2038 DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, such as, integrating DoD unmanned systems within the National Airspace and safely operating unmanned aerial systems within the Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB). The UAST collaborates with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation (TEVV) Working Group to help ensure that UAST is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.
  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&amp;E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces. UAST continued research on autonomous system test planning to develop technologies which develop the most pertinent test plans for maritime, air, and ground-based autonomous systems and enable testers to identify the degree of regression testing required for autonomous systems upon changes to the hardware and software.  The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  UAST invested in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  UAST continued developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will also prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, test range boundaries, and warning areas.</r2:Text>

The technologies will be fully compliant with TENA and suitable for integration on the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability network.  
  The UAST project will continue to develop test technologies that address mid-term UAS test challenges associated with autonomy and initiate efforts to explore the far term challenges of testing system intelligence.  These efforts will include research on test technologies to measure the logical flow of sensing data to perception, decisions, and action.  The UAST project will invest in complementary tools to predict UAS behavior by monitoring how autonomous systems process data in response to environmental changes.  The UAST project will investigate technologies for T&amp;E of UAS-to-UAS and human-to-UAS interactions.
  The UAST project will demonstrate technologies to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will be TENA compliant to facilitate transition across the MRTFB.

Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will require advancement and maturation of nascent test technologies.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats and test environments, executing cyberspace tests, and performing cyberspace test analysis and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.

P455, the Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF), incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects.  First, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs.  Second, to establish within the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; accordingly, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing programs, rather than one-off projects.

P456, the Hybrid Energy Storage Module (HESM), co-sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment (ASD(EIE)), develops advanced energy storage technologies to maximize performance and reliability, and enable future high power weapons and sensor systems on legacy and next generation vehicles, aircraft and ships. The goals of HESM are to (1) demonstrate energy storage systems with high power/energy densities, scalable to all power levels, that reduce total logistics demand, (2) increase platform ability to sustain operations during engagement, and (3) reduce maintenance. Once demonstration is complete, this technology will be sustained by the Services and will be used to extend the operational performance and safety for these applications beyond the hybrid storage module baseline design configuration. This program is closely coordinated with the Advanced Management and Protection of Energy-storage Devices (AMPED) program of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

TROPEC conducted four field assessments and completed three lab assessments, partnered with two winning FY16 OECIF unmanned systems proposals, delivered two newsletters, and coordinated with countless organizations on future assessment opportunities.

The consortia programs begun in FY13 generally reached their conclusion.  The Tactical Microgrid Standards Consortium (TMSC) incorporated DoD and industry comments and finalized the draft Tactical Microgrid Standards.  The Energy Efficient Outpost Modeling Consortium (EEOMC) completed the verification and validation (V&amp;V) plan for the Energy Resource Planning Tool, updated the Commander's Application to enhance mode prioritization and optimization of generators and demonstrated with hardware, and offered pilot courses on energy efficiency in expeditionary operations.  The Soldier and Small Unit Power consortium assisted the Marines in drafting their Dismounted Forces Energy Requirements Concept of Employment policy document; utilized the Power and Energy Test Bed to characterize Nett Warrior baseline configurations for Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier supporting Program of Record Milestone decisions; and established a multi-agency, multi-Service consortium to coordinate Dismounted Warfighter efforts for the future.  The Engineered Surface Materials and Coatings Drag Reduction consortium conducted flight tests, and reviewed proposals and made Phase 1 technology maturation awards to selected drag reduction “Challenge” winners.
 
The analytical methods programs started in FY14 have continued.  The Synthetic Theater Operations Research
Model-Energy (STORM-E) effort translated a series of tool-based, OE focused, roadmap model enhancements, and performed Expeditionary Force 21 (EF 21) scenario development activities for implementation in STORM.  The Operational Energy Analysis Task Force (OEATF) completed V&amp;V of technical reports for the Fuel Consumption Prediction Model (FCPM) and Shelter Thermal Energy Model (STEM); conducted Soldier-level excursions using the Infantry Warrior Simulation (IWARS) to investigate the impact of system failure during combat operations; completed scenario enhancements for the second of three scenarios; continued to make enhancements to the Fully Burdened Cost Tool (FBCT) and successfully transitioned FBCT operations to the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC); and completed the baseline Phase IV model using the System of Systems Analysis Toolset (SoSAT).  The Joint Deployment Energy Planning and Logistics Optimization Initiative (J-DEPLOI) program brought software developer Group W on contract, developed a plan for integration of their decision support tool into the Map-Based Planning Services (MBPS) system, began adaption of existing software code to meet new requirements for fuel planning, and completed an implementation directive for the new tool's development.  The Comprehensive Operational Energy (COE) Toolkit program completed the programming and graphical user interface to measure, model, and examine the installation OE damage and capacity reduction caused by enemy interdiction.  The Mission Engineering Analytical Method for Operational Energy program (MEAM) integrated and refined prototype tools with as much verified fuel consumption data as could be identified and developed a range of excursion assessments based upon wartime scenarios, established cost analysis methodology, and investigated the ability of the tool to support future surface combatant platform design and force structure.  The Capability Assessment &amp; Modeling for Energy Logistics (CAMEL) program developed methods and tools to explore airlift and aerial refueling effects within anti-access/area-denial (A2AD) environments; explored the impact of counter operational energy threats, military infrastructure investment and adaptive basing strategies; completed analysis of advanced combat engine technology impacts; and began analysis of costs incurred with flex basing.

The major program started in FY15 is called “Improving Fuel Economy for the Current Ground Tactical Fleet Program,” and consists of four separate programs.  The Thermally Efficient Cylinders program prepared and reconfigured the single-cylinder test laboratory for efficiency and heat rejection measurements, and developed a testing and modeling and simulation plan.  The Tactical Vehicle Electrification Kit (TVEK) program has completed two major System Engineering processes (TARGET GATE 1 - Ideation &amp; Scoping  Concepts &amp; Feasibility, and System Needs Review) to kick off the project, began procuring critical long lead inverter controllers (20kW and 75kW), procured Caterpillar (CAT) 15 engine and instrumentation for fuel map testing, signed Memoranda of Agreements (MOAs) with all internal and external Integrated Project Team (IPT) organizations, and completed market surveys for DC/DC converters and other electrification subsystems.  The Automation/Smart Cruise Control program completed Phase I of single vehicle simulation, upgraded hardware, and conducted vehicle tests.  The Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) for Vehicle Light-Weighting program began developing the analytical framework for the baseline Finite-Element Analysis (FEA) system model and Multi Body Dynamics model to generate loading for the FEA model, examined various vehicle components to target for light-weighting, and conducted weight optimization studies on components.
        
The Joint Infantry Company Prototype (JIC-P) program performed small scale user evaluations with multiple units, conducted a human factors study on the kinetic harvesters, and continued to improve M&amp;S data.
 
For the shorter term projects funded using add money from FY15, accomplishments for FY16 include the following.  The Cyber program completed seven cyber-security threat assessments at defense fuel supply points and installations.  The M&amp;S Federations program has succeeded in finalizing contracts with all performers, and secured agreements to participate throughout the life of the program with Departmental partners designated as potential transition partners for any capabilities developed.

New programs started in FY16 reflect a shift within OECIF from an emphasis on contingency bases to one on mobile platforms for the Pacific.  The new program focus will improve the operational energy performance of unmanned air, sea and ground systems that could be used in the Pacific.  The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Power System program identified the contract vehicle and worked on the contract award to build the Great Horned Owl engine.  The Hybrid Tiger team developed the major software architecture for hybrid vehicle control, completed initial vehicle (wing) sizing to include spreadsheet analysis of combined fuel cell and solar performance, and initiated a contract through the Naval Research lab Contracting Division.  The Hydrothermal Vent Exploitation for Undersea Power and Energy (HTVE-UE) program initiated the funding coordination documentation for awarding a small business performer contract, and commenced several of the studies and analyses related to HTV characteristics, potential environment impacts of this initiative, and various concepts of operations (CONOPS).  The Aluminum-Water Power for Unmanned Undersea Vehicles program began testing of the start system, and component requirements are being defined for the preferred configuration.  The Small Turboprop Engine Range/Power Enhancement program initiated the procurement package for the engine demonstration, started the Operational Benefits Analysis (OBA), completed the baseline engine model, is working on the Improved Performance Technology Engine (IPTE) model, and is working with the Air Force and Pacific Command (PACOM) on selecting missions of interest for the MQ-9 Reaper to use to assess operational benefit.  The JP-8 Fuel Cell Power program awarded two contracts to begin JP-8 reformer based fuel cell power system development, and began concept refinement and initial instrumentation diagrams.</r2:Text>

The analytical methods programs, which began in FY14, will continue.  The STORM-E effort will advance the EF 21 scenario development and analysis capabilities, identify energy-based risk to operations, examine mitigation solutions, and shape plans and programs.  OEATF will complete the FCPM V&amp;V; complete analysis of the second of three scenarios; complete scenario enhancements for the third of three scenarios; develop an IWARS technical report addressing OE; and represent aerial resupply capability within SoSAT.  J-DEPLOI plans to continue adaptation and development of Group W's fuel planning tool, continue executing the plan for integration with MBPS, and begin verification and testing of the tool's first incremental capabilities.  MEAM plans to assess future force structure and logistics force implications, investigate incorporating Joint and Coalition operations, define warfighting operational effectiveness tactical decision aid requirements, and develop a production plan for resulting tools and methods.  CAMEL will continue analyzing concepts of operations associated with adaptive basing strategies within A2AD environments and the impact to operational energy within airlift and aerial refueling missions; explore overall costs associated with flex basing; and continue enhancements to the modeling, simulation and analysis tool set.

The FY15 vehicles program will continue.  The Thermally Efficient Cylinders program will conduct single-cylinder engine testing with the first generation coating; the coating and piston optimization will be based on feedback from testing and modeling.  The TVEK project will complete CAT 15 HEMTT A4 engine fuel map testing, test the baseline HEMTT vehicle's auxiliary systems, complete Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) of auxiliary systems for TVEK electrified component selections, develop M&amp;S controls and software for the TVEK supervisory control system, initiate procurement of optimized TVEK components for testing in a system integration lab (SIL) at TARDEC, and conduct System Functional Review and Preliminary Design Review as part of the system engineering process.  The Automation/Smart Cruise Control program will enter Phase II and conduct convoy vehicle simulations.  The M&amp;S for Vehicle Light-Weighting program will repeat the weight optimization process with various other target components and compare the updated optimized system model with the baseline model.

The programs begun in FY16 will continue to ramp up during this fiscal year.  The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical UAS Power System program will build the Great Horned Owl engine, which will lead to a runnable second generation engine.  The Hybrid Tiger team will complete vehicle detailed analysis and purchase new wing tooling to build an integrated solar wing, combine software from multiple organizations, and complete end-to-end bench testing in preparation for maiden flight.  The HTVE-UE program will award a small business performer contract and initiate base tasks related to the detailed design, component fabrication and breadboard assembly, and test planning; and expand studies and analyses related to Forward Deployed Energy and Communications Outpost  (FDECO) interoperability, HTV characterization/environmental considerations, and various CONOPS.  The Aluminum Seawater Power program will begin preliminary component fabrication of hardware and select test equipment.  The Small Turboprop Engine Range/Power Enhancement program will complete the OBA, complete the engine requirements document and get Air Force concurrence, and will start engine preliminary design.  The JP-8 Based Fuel Cell Power Program will conduct JP-8 reformer maturation, increase the technology readiness level of the solid oxide fuel cell being used in the system, and begin the system level controls strategy and initial integration plan.  
 
New programs starting in FY17 may continue the shift within OECIF toward a greater emphasis on fuel consuming mobile platforms for the Pacific.  The focus of these new FY17 programs is likely to reflect input from the Services, various research Communities of Interest within DoD, such as Energy and Power, Ground and Sea Platforms, and Air Platforms, and any developing gaps or opportunities identified by ODASD(OE).</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, requires expertise and information access. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners. CWMD Systems is addressing existing gaps and deficiencies through a portfolio of investments. 

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for software development and integration, including development of new applications for existing systems; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, requires expertise and information access. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners. CWMD Systems is addressing existing gaps and deficiencies through a portfolio of investments. 

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for software development and integration, including development of new applications for existing systems; contractor personnel for fusion cells at DTRA and DIA; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

Nuclear terrorism is one of the most significant and pressing threats identified by national leadership.  A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  During the Deputy Management Advisory Group process shortfalls and resources to close these gaps were identified and supported by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems such as ground based prompt diagnostic systems and airborne sample collection systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of nuclear forensics. 

Per DoDD 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB provides guidance and direction for the implementation of the Department of Defense National Technical Nuclear Forensics program.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but emphasizes post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post-detonation nuclear forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AEDIS/AV information service supports USD(AT&amp;L), CAE, and Service Chief responsibilities by providing critical information for acquisition analysis, oversight, and decision making. AEDIS/AV institutionalizes the management of data and business rules used in the Department’s acquisition decision making, and it integrates the acquisition data stored across multiple disparate Federal and Departmental organizations’ data sets and systems. AEDIS/AV investment delivers a Department-wide accessible collection of acquisition information, techniques, and tools, including the Defense Acquisition Visibility Environment (DAVE), the Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval (DAMIR) capability, and acquisition data analysis capabilities as well as data access services and data standards via the Acquisition Visibility Data Matrix (AVDM). Funding supports enhancements to Acquisition Visibility through the definition, development, and fielding of concepts and tools for Department-wide data analysis for use across Congress and the Department, particularly in support of the DAE and his decision authority.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This initiative responds to Congressional direction for the Department to increase energy efficiency, reduce installation energy intensity, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy security. Emerging energy technologies offer DoD a cost effective opportunity to meet these requirements on its installations while reducing energy and operational costs. The DoD test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test bed's key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC), the Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) program element develops, demonstrates and validates cost-effective technologies for use in humanitarian demining via operational field evaluations in support of Geographical Combatant Commands (GCC) Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) goals and objectives.  

The HD R&amp;D Program works closely with the GCCs and the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) to craft a research and development plan that supports GCC HMA program plans and strategic objectives and enhances mil-to-mil partnerships in key regional states and provides access to live mines/UXO around the world for operational test data collection unavailable to any other DoD organization.  The HD R&amp;D Program accomplishes the GCC support by utilizing host nation demining partners to evaluate technology in actual minefields to simultaneously achieve HMA objectives and identify performance parameters; data is delivered to the US military countermine R&amp;D programs to inform future investment decisions.  In addition to the improvements made to technologies used by U.S. forces and to the reduction of landmine and UXO threat to US forces and host nation population, the Program’s technology trainings and evaluations build mine action capacity and capability within mine-affected countries and improve safety, stability and economic development. 

Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 199 evaluations in 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program’s technologies have cleared 42 million square meters of the world’s toughest minefields; and found or destroyed 177,000 mines and UXO.

New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), GCC Humanitarian Mine Action offices, mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element’s work fulfills the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Following a rapid prototyping strategy, the program emphasizes the use/modification of existing, commercially-available equipment and components to build functional prototype equipment suited for humanitarian demining operations.  This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Obtain adequate funding to support critical shortfalls; prioritize proposals that are deemed acceptable and allocate funding accordingly; and establish outreach programs to leverage institutional knowledge and expertise.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) supports DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  In its sixteen-year history, CWP has leveraged $4 of foreign partner funding from 76 foreign partners and $3 of other U.S. Government funding for every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects. CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over 23 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of 
improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, academies and research laboratories, focused on corrosion technology research and development to provide solutions to long-term, complex corrosion prevention and control problems, including metallic-non-metallic interactions, advanced surface coatings and treatments for non-traditional use of materials. This advanced corrosion research has been funded since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of storage tanks and other mission support facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of electrical and avionics equipment.  Likewise, an array of highly effective, rapid cure coatings that are easy to apply and can forestall corrosion for many years on aircraft and ships are being developed.  Other vital projects being considered include sealants, wash down systems, sensors and prognostic technologies that have joint service applications and potential to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects over a wide range of systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD has been estimated at over $20 billion each year. The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.
 
These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense infrastructure as well as warfighting systems.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  The current composite return on investment for these projects is 16:1.  Each of the services has identified important projects that vastly increase operational readiness and reduce operations and maintenance costs.  All services are studying advanced coatings and corrosion inhibitors that improve reliability and life of equipment.  New inspection monitoring techniques focused on rapid and quantitative assessment of corrosion are also being investigated.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisitions are accomplished in three categories including projects, research opportunities, and activities as described in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.

Projects are funded jointly by CPO and the Military Departments and are led by subject matter experts at the Military Department laboratories.  CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  The Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Project Team (CPCIPT) receives project plans and engages an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Research opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel chaired by the Deputy Director, CPO.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Activities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by CPO.  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Missile Defeat Project counters the growing global advancement and proliferation of road-mobile ballistic missile threats. This effort develops and integrates new capability and architectures to optimize fielded weapon systems and C4ISR to defeat these emerging threats. 

The Missile Defeat Project coordinates and integrates DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) efforts to develop counter threat capability. This effort measures the effectiveness of new architectures and revolutionary concepts against evolving threats by working with the IC, Combatant Commands, government labs, program offices, industry, and academia. 

To meet this challenge the Missile Defeat Project leverages existing test and simulated environments to perform analysis of industry and government reference concepts and architectures to provide innovative technical solutions for missile defeat. We are developing virtual and physical testbeds to robustly test, evaluate, and prototype architectures and assess their ability to improve time critical targeting and defeat of road-mobile threats. The virtual testbed complements testing at physical ranges by providing an infrastructure for addressing different training, test, and evaluation needs. This effort also includes systems engineering and analysis to devolve technical requirements, identify promising solutions, and inform future investment decisions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Missile Defeat Project performs system engineering, integration, and modeling and simulation in support of the development of a set of system architectures.  In addition, it develops integrated capability assessments with updated architectures and threat scenarios, defines and allocates options, expands functionality, and incorporates exercise results for missile defeat enterprise tools.  The end-to-end systems engineering informs capability investments and requirement allocations across the missile defeat enterprise.

The Missile Defeat Project is leveraging existing state of the art and emerging technology to offer game changing solutions for the department’s highest priorities.  This technology is evaluated using new and novel concepts of operation to rapidly deliver improved time critical targeting, concepts of operation, and missile defeat to the warfighter.  The Missile Defeat Project is developing an evolutionary roadmap to document an architecture that best utilizes the Nation’s resources to defeat the emerging threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) identifies, analyzes, demonstrates, and transitions game-changing applications of existing and near-term technology (and other U.S. Government capabilities) to shape and counter emerging threats.  Currently focused on the Asia-Pacific Rebalance, SCO combines capability innovation with concepts of operation and information management to develop novel concepts often crossing Service, Defense-Intelligence, and multi-classification divides.  This helps to solve critical national security challenges in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Joint Chiefs of Staff, Intelligence Community, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  SCO analyzes, demonstrates, and red-teams these concepts on an accelerated time frame to enable subsequent programmatic decisions on alternative capabilities that have greater mission impact and lower cost.

The Advanced Innovative Technologies Program Element (PE) contains projects that include in-depth analysis to determine technical and operational performance and risk, component and subsystem-level prototyping and testing to reduce risk, and operational demonstrations to prove concept viability prior to subsequent programmatic decisions.  Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) identifies, analyzes, demonstrates, and transitions game-changing applications of existing and near-term technology (and other U.S. Government capabilities) to shape and counter emerging threats.  Currently focused on the Asia-Pacific Rebalance, SCO combines capability innovation with concepts of operation and information management to develop novel concepts often crossing Service, Defense-Intelligence, and multi-classification divides.  SCO helps to solve critical national security challenges in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, Combatant Commands (COCOMS), Joint Chiefs of Staff, Intelligence Community, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  SCO analyzes, demonstrates, and red-teams these concepts on an accelerated time frame to enable subsequent programmatic decisions on alternative capabilities that have greater mission impact and lower cost.

The Advanced Innovative Technologies Program Element (PE) contains projects that include in-depth analysis to determine technical and operational performance and risk, component and subsystem-level prototyping and testing to reduce risk, and operational demonstrations to prove concept viability prior to subsequent programmatic decisions.  Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) is a continuation of effort from the Trusted Foundry PE 0605140D8Z.  FY18 funds in the amount of $84.200M are being transferred from PE 0605140D8Z for the Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) Capabilities and Standards for Trust and the New Trust Approach Development activities planned across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  

This PE implements, maintains and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a Government-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the government.  Its goal is to eliminate the Department of Defense (DoD)’s reliance on sole source foundries for trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will implement three integrated, complementary solutions that (1) provide for Intellectual Property (IP) protection of microelectronics components; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate trust and assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentive the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to assuring the trust of the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial SOTA microelectronics technology.

Approximately 30 percent of the DoD’s Major Defense Acquisition Programs rely on the Trusted Foundry, the only Trust-accredited SOTA foundry, to build critical and sensitive integrated circuits for the DoD, Intelligence Community and Defense contractors.

This activity is being led by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)).  Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane is responsible for day-to-day management and execution of the DoD long-term trusted and assured microelectronics strategy.  This activity will include performers from the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) Steering Committee and a new Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Advisory Board, and include performers, such as the JFAC service providers, Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), and other DoD and Intelligence Community S&amp;T organizations and laboratories in the area of hardware assurance (HwA) and software assurance (SwA).  It will integrate and support the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and the related HwA and SwA S&amp;T actions.  This activity is also expected to maintain and update the DoD long-term microelectronics strategy based on feedback from the execution of this PE and enable and leverage commercial and academic relationships as necessary to fulfill this mission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of verifying the trust and assurance of parts and develops standards and practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories and other HwA and SwA capabilities are chartered as a JFAC to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (&lt;45 nanometers (nm)), throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities, in coordination with the JFAC, which prioritizes this investment as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for JFAC services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:

•	Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards 
•	Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts
•	Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.

This project develops and matures assurance mitigations, evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, and system vulnerability assessments and testbeds.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of trustworthy designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., trustworthy designs and supply chains.

This project was previously funded in PE 0605140D8Z BA 5 and has been transferred to this BA 4 PE to correctly align funding in support of the mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Verification and test technologies will include:
• Improvements to the core JFAC’s (1) technical capability, through the procurement of laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.  FY18 and out-year demands will require an increase in capacity supporting weapon system program engagement, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of assessment capabilities.
• Enhancement of automation and standard processes needed to increase the throughput of information produced by individual JFAC laboratory tools as well as to facilitate information sharing across the families of tools used for analysis and testing.
• Development of common subject matter expert (SME) training and protocols based on the existing tool base, to include both commercial and government-developed tools.
• Funding for additional SME support in each core laboratory in support of the microelectronics trust verification and other JFAC-related work.
• Increased direct program support focused on addressing technical gaps and trust-related findings.

Standards and practices will include:
• Development of standards and best practices, and relationships with industry, to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.
• Establishment of formal relationships with FPGA vendors and other key commercial suppliers to improve device and IP security.
• Acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop design practices that minimize security flaws and facilitate verification. 
• Establishment of government and industry working groups to develop test procedures to validate the trust of designs.
• Documentation and promulgation of security-enhancing design practices across government, industry, and academia.
• Development of industry-wide standards and practices to establish a common understanding of what constitutes verified and trusted hardware/software/firmware at both the component and systems level.
• Development of a common lexicon for secure hardware/software/firmware in collaboration with the Committee for National Security Systems, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the broader United States Government, industry, and academia.
• Definition of supply chain controls for assured chain of custody for critical and other microelectronics devices and IP.
• Development of security training and education of government and industry system security engineers and material managers on supply chain and life-cycle management best practices using agreed-upon language, standards, and practices.
• Alignment of DoD Instruction 5200.44 (Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN)), related policies, and NIST 800-161 (Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations) with industry standards identifying and addressing gaps in definition and criteria and establishing accepted levels of supplier and part trustworthiness.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include SOTA microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of trust in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It also is intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of microelectronics trust and assurance.

This program of research will develop innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Trust techniques, active hardware trust control, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also develops, demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Technologies that assure trust and assurance in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of third-party IP to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

The JFAC will initiate the conduct of identified acquisition program pilots and technology demonstrations in coordination with research programs across government R&amp;D organizations, academia and industry.

Initiate or support at least one research program in each of the following technical areas:
• Design-For-Trust techniques   
• IP protection 
• Low-volume SOTA  manufacturing
• Electronic component markers                                    
• Imaging technologies and forensics                                   
• Computing infrastructure and processing methods. 

Primary efforts will include reducing-to-practice technologies enabling trusted (1) design, (2) access, (3) component integrity and (4) IP protection.  FY18 and FY19 primary activities include development of these technologies, followed by transition of these capabilities to new programs in the following fiscal years under PE 0605140D8Z. 
 
This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Unmanned Systems (UxS) Common Development program is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address unmanned systems’ issues across all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across all unmanned systems.  This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft system (UAS) integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a demonstration of a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially were the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk and Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as  operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution.
 
This joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Completed small UAS Groups 1-3 airworthiness requirements study and provided a document that identifies gaps and recommends courses of action. Completed survey and analysis of UAS CONUS operating locations and airspace requirements.  Continued analysis of UAS AI Safety Case issues to expand UAS access to the NAS. Developed and validated separation minima that enabled low-altitude military UA to remain well clear of other aircraft.  Identified and addressed key capability gaps for broad-spectrum military UAS operations at low altitudes.  Through the SARP, coordinated with and leverage the resources of the FAA, NASA and DHS to work common integration challenges. Investigated and identified best-candidate solutions for low size, weight, power and cost approaches supporting military small UAS (sUAS) operations in national, international and foreign national airspace. Finalized and reported recommended criteria and methods to quantify the contribution of the UAS pilot performance of the SAA function to overall airspace safety. Engaged with FAA to discuss concepts, architectures, functional requirements as well as policy and procedural issues regarding UAS Spectrum, Communications, Command and Control and other infrastructure that was enhanced, improved or replaced in order to facilitate DoD UAS integration into the NAS. Collaborated to develop and implemented operating systems in the NAS that support UAS integration, such as GBSAA. Identified specific use cases of current operations and identified the gaps/deltas between current UAS operations in the NAS under a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) and UAS operating as fully integrated into the NAS.  Identified specific scenarios for research, implementation, and testing. Identified operational use cases for research, development, and testing, and provided semantic decision support, and modeling and simulation.</r2:Text>

The combined C2 capability demonstrated a Navy Common Control Station (CCS) and Air Force Common Mission Command Center (CMCC) working together and sharing mission and telemetry data using UAS Control Segment Architecture (UCS) interfaces. 
  
Developed a Joint Communication Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JCAUS) which aims to establish a Government and Industry framework for unmanned systems communications. The architecture aligns with modular open systems architecture principles and allows PoRs to encourage competitive business environments and to react to emerging and urgent communication requirements faster by providing a framework for rapid technology insertions. 

Established an MOA between Navy and Army Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) PoRs to assess their Joint Architecture Unmanned System (JAUS) based test tools to develop a plan that will combine and standardize the tools sets.

Sponsored an Unmanned Systems Interoperability and Integration workshop/technical exchange that focused on the integration aspects of unmanned systems, rather than the technology of the systems themselves.  Focus areas were Unmanned Systems Integration with Platforms (integration of UxS to Aircraft, Ships, Ground Vehicles); with other Systems (integration of payloads, weapons, sensors); with Humans (operator interaction, human-robot interface, controllers, trust issues, training etc.) and Integration with the Force/Fleet (mission integration).

Assessed the Unmanned Systems Safety Guidance Document, publish in 2007, for technology advancement gaps due to the evolution of autonomous technology and unmanned systems. The identified gaps were categorized as “critical”, “substantial” and “other”.   The six critical gaps resulted largely from the evolution of unmanned systems into more autonomous and learning systems, increased weaponization of the systems, easier access to such systems by all nations and even non-nation actors, and the increasingly robotic (or mobile) nature of unmanned systems.</r2:Text>

This was a new start program in FY 2017. This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the Department's intent to reinvigorate wargaming.  CAPE will accomplish this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the vision of the Deputy Secretary of Defense to reinvigorate wargaming in the Department of Defense.  CAPE will accomplish this by leading wargaming activities; developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Investments are targeted to defense requirements within the budget year of execution. The defense wide focus
areas for the FY2015 Rapid Innovation Fund Program include; 1) Deliver near term, emerging technologies to enhance the capabilities for current Military operations; 2) Innovative technologies that enhance position, navigation, timing accuracies, improve targeting/delivery in GPS-denied environments and prevent exploitation of systems lost in denied areas (e.g., anti-tamper capabilities); 3) Develop and demonstrate breakthrough
technologies for future Military capabilities. FY2015 funds will be distributed evenly between the services (Army, Navy, Air Force) and the 4th estate agencies.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities. The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities. To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.  In FY 2018, as in previous years, funding for the individual Service initiatives will be contingent upon their abilities to execute and achieve satisfactory progress towards project goals as determined by the CPGS portfolio manager.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Pilot Program is a result of a USD (AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF ‘best practices’ related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Pilot Program is a result of a USD (AT&amp;L) sponsored legislative proposal for authorities to better prepare warfighting systems for non-US use. This program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs. Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activity such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance. Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements onto contracts; and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. 

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

A number of designated systems participating in the DEF Pilot Program in FY18 will continue defining and implementing DEF ‘best practices’ related to designing and developing technology protection in the areas of program management, system engineering, and technology protection measures in the DoD acquisition process. Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate adequate domestic and exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY16, the DEF Pilot Program is initiating or continuing contracts for DEF feasibility studies or DEF design activities on the following previously selected systems (plus any new DEF Pilot Program designated systems selected by OSD for FY 2016 - 2017):
- Height of Burst Fuzing (US Air Force)
- Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (US Air Force)
- Small Diameter Bomb II (US Air Force)
- Joint Air to Ground Missile (US Army)
- Air and Missile Defense Radar (US Navy)
- Miniature Air Launched Decoy (US Air Force)
- Indirect Fire Protection Capability (US Army)

- Review of major defense acquisition programs for exportability as part of the major milestone review process.
- Identify and select new pilot program candidates from Service Acquisition Executive nominations.
- Identify Service leads and subject matter experts, to provide support to programs, prior to Milestone B, to develop plans for exportability features. 
- Manage, fund, and track the completion of the contractor exportability feasibility studies and design activities. 
- Oversee drafting of DEF Lessons Learned and Interim Progress Reviews and Final Reports from DEF studies conducted in FY 2016.
- Draft and submit the annual Report to Congress on the program.

The focus for FY 2016 for the DEF pilot program will be to execute initial or follow-on feasibility studies for selected DEF Pilot Programs, and to conduct initial or follow-on DEF design studies on designated DEF pilot programs.  As with the FY 2015 programs, FY 2016 feasibility studies will define the required actions for incorporating DEF into programs, begin DEF designs on select designated programs, and assess the potential costs of those actions.  OUSD (AT&amp;L) will continue to engage with program offices through the Military Department DEF POCs, and serve as a liaison among the program offices, the Military Departments, and other defense agencies to facilitate the feasibility studies.  For pre-MS A and B systems, OUSD(AT&amp;L)/IC will ensure the DEF feasibility studies are addressed in their program Acquisition Strategies and Program Protection Plans (PPP).  For Post-MS B platforms, when there is already a contract in place, OUSD (AT&amp;L) will work with the program managers and contracting officers to implement the necessary contractual modifications to ensure that the feasibility studies were executed.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>BUDGET REQUEST JUSTIFICATION:  +$21.353 million is required to support the following efforts:

Next Generation Resource Management System (NGRMS): funds are realigned from the Defense Logistics Agency to OSD to align funding with the program office for more efficient execution.

Financial Management Certification Tracking and Reporting Tool (FM-CTRT): +$2.000M new start support to plan, develop, test and implement the Department of Defense FM-CTRT.  The DoD FM-CTRT replaces the WHS FM Learning Management System (LMS) DoD Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) system of record. After three years, FM LMS has performed barely adequately in implementing section 1051 of the FY 2012 NDAA, Public Law 112-8 for improved audit readiness and analytical capability for the 54,000 DoD FM workforce.  

Universe of Transactions: +$10.500 million is for the first phase of the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool implementation with U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and other Defense Agency systems to develop a baseline application and configuration to support financial statement audits. When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current time line for the first phase is estimated to be completed by December 2017. The follow on phase for DATA Act and remaining systems in scope will require development activities through September 2018. This effort complies with the NDAA requirement to use big data technologies to support financial audits.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).
  
NEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION TRACKING AND REPORTING TOOL:

The Defense Financial Management Certification Program (DFMCP) meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Public Law 112-81, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to establish a certification program for the 54,000 Financial Management (FM) workforce in order to improve audit readiness and analytic capability.  

The Department of Defense has a requirement to strengthen the professional development of the DoD financial management workforce and to ensure that DoD financial managers are properly trained to meet current and future requirements to support the Warfighter.  The DFMCP is the approved strategy to meet this requirement.  The DFMCP needs a tracking and reporting tool for web-based course training and exams, a robust reporting capability for standard and ad hoc reports, a course search capability, sort filtering capability, and a capability to attach multiple documents once the training certification requirements are completed.  The tool will self-guides users through the policies and procedures required by the program, without the burden of extensive training on how to use the system itself.  The tool will enable program operations, with embedded business rules, that represent policy and procedures, and have internal controls that prevent improper actions.  The tool will be intuitive, track and record activities, and enable users to perform correct actions the first time.  The tool will provide a reporting tool that furnishes leadership with near real time management reports concerning FM Workforce Certification Qualifications and be adaptable to reasonable changes in DFMCP policies and procedures.

UNIVERSE OF TRANSACTIONS:
Funding will support financial audit. A Universe of Transaction (UoT) inclusive of all Department of Defense (DoD) Wide Appropriation General Fund (TI-97) information is needed to support reconciliation of fifteen General Fund accounting systems, reconciliation of eighteen business feeder systems to general fund accounting system, and validating UoT capabilities through the audit examinations of DCMA and DoDEA.
	
The DoD TI-97 UoT requires:
• All supporting TI-97 data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)
• Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)
• Ability to extract subset populations
• Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT

The failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.

To achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool (AUD-IT).  This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD’s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard financial data.  Both an application and analytical platform, the AUD-IT leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete UoT for TI-97.  

The first phase of AUD-IT implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration.  When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current timeline for the proof of concept is estimated to be completed by December 2017.

AUD-IT is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>The initial plan was to move funding to DLA starting in FY2017 for more efficient execution.  However, due to delays in the NGRMS environment and no significant progress in the program execution by the DLA Program Management Office, the funding should move back to OUSD(C) to allow Comptroller to get the project back on track and determine a way forward.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department’s budget focuses on institutionalizing and financing our capabilities to fight the wars we are in today and the scenarios we are most likely to face in the years ahead, while at the same time mitigating risk and providing for contingency operations. It also includes a fundamental overhaul of the DoD’s approach to procurement, acquisition, and contracting.  As such, the complex details of budgeting and tracking of funds become increasingly critical to senior leader decision making and to provide accountability to the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

Today, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller OUSD(C) and the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation (CAPE) use various distinct automated systems (Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resource Collection Process (PRCP), Supplemental Resource Collection Process (SRCP), Budget Exhibits Generator and Standard Data Collection System (SDCS)) to formulate, justify, and execute DoD budgets.  These six or more systems interact with at least several computer-based systems controlled by external organizations and agencies.  These systems manage very similar financial information, yet each uses its own scheme for representing information.  Much of the information managed by these systems is redundant.  Cross-system data representations and redundancies make it difficult to exchange and to reconcile information.  The capabilities provided by Comptroller systems, in some cases, fail to deliver services needed by its users, or fail to operate in ways that complement current and emerging business practices.  They fail to give executives information in a comprehensible form, making it difficult to draw conclusions.  Data disparities and functional redundancy make these systems more costly to maintain than they need to be.

There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.  

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administer and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C). Funded efforts will improve the timeliness of resource management reviews and decisions for senior leaders and Congress.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The DFMCP meets the business requirement to comply with section 1051 of the FY 2012 NDAA, Public Law 112-8 for improved audit readiness and analytic capability of the 54,000-strong Financial Management (FM) workforce. 

The Department of Defense continues to use the Washington Headquarter Services Learning Management System (LMS) DFMCP system of record. LMS has performed barely adequately in implementing the certification program. A fair assessment by the program office is that despite three years of providing, improving and proliferating training, most FM LMS users and administrators cannot use the LMS proficiently. The result from the users’ perspectives is that the program is flawed, that achievement of certification is unnecessarily difficult, and that instead of enabling the DFMCP, the FM LMS is an obstacle to be surmounted. The FM workforce’s frustration with the FM LMS was raised by the Military Department Comptrollers and the Directors of the DFAS and DCAA as the most significant issue with the new FM Certification Program and an issue requiring immediate resolution.  This culminated with an Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) decision to explore other alternatives to the current FM LMS.  The existing FM LMS is a cumbersome and expensive system.

This effort is to plan, develop, test and implement the DoD Financial Management Certification Tracking and Reporting Tool (FM-CTRT) as a more efficient and cost effective solution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>+$10.500 million is for the first phase of the Auditable Universe of Data Intelligence Tool implementation with U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and other Defense Agency systems to develop a baseline application and configuration to support financial statement audits. When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The current time line for the first phase is estimated to be completed by December 2017. The follow on phase for DATA Act and remaining systems in scope will require development activities through September 2018. This effort complies with the NDAA requirement to use big data technologies to support financial audits.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Without a single UoT to support the TI97 General Fund for the 4th Estate the Department will be incapable of asserting readiness for an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements.   All DoD organizations are pursuing the current statutory goal of achieving the state of audit readiness (target September 30, 2017) that supports entry into a full financial statement of audit in FY 2018 (target start date March 2018) with an initial opinion rendered in mid-FY 2019.  Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law. 

The requested funds will be used to buy “Big Data” software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT requirement. 
This UFR includes subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor.  This will not result in hiring additional government personnel. 

The UoT will have the capability to:
•	Ingest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems
•	Normalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture
•	Reconcile transactional details to summary financial data
•	Provide auditor’s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions
•	Business Analytics/Reporting
•	DATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017
•	Provide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data

This effort is a proof of concept focused on USSOCOM, but will apply to all TI-97 general fund entities.  The scope is to bring in data from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit readiness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As part of the stand-up of this single IRB, Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) and DoD Components are charged with specifying and delivering required business outcomes for the Department. These business outcomes are then incorporated into the architecture and data products making up the Department's Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), under the oversight and direction of the Defense Business Council.  These metrics measure the incorporation of the Component identified business outcomes and associated component organizational alignments into the BEA. •FY 2016 Goal: 90% of business outcomes and PRM/BRM performance data incorporated into the BEA.
•FY 2017 Goal: 100% of business outcomes and PRM/BRM performance data incorporated into the BEA.•FY 2018 Goal: 100% of business outcomes and PRM/BRM performance data incorporated into the BEA.  Section 2222 of Title 10, USC further required that the defense business enterprise architecture include an information infrastructure to enable the producing of timely accurate and reliable business information.  This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision making.

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY 2018, funds from this Program Element (PE) will be transferred to a new Budget Activity (BA) 5 PE 0605294D8Z and BA 4 0604294D8Z to allow more efficient execution of the development and prototyping activities within the body of work.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate trust of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to assuring the trust of the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.

This activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations and laboratories, defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&amp;T activities.  

This activity implements, maintains and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Recognizing that trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a Government-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the government.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of assuring commercial parts and develops standards/practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories have recently been chartered as a Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technologies, throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities in a collaborative nature amongst the core technical laboratories, driven by projected and realized out-year demand.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:

• Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards 
• Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts
• Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements will address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of trustworthy designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., trustworthy designs and supply chains.

Beginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z to accurately reflect execution of funds in support of the mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In addition, utilizing the 2015 JFAC hardware assurance capability survey, developed a plan of action based on incremental technical improvement and capacity across participating JFAC laboratories in the following areas:
• Equipment re-capitalization and new equipment
• Data and imaging processing
• Enhanced automation 
• Technology and IP licensing
• Training and SME development
• Maintenance support
• Feasibility studies
• Reimbursable (test fixtures, boards, parts, and supplies)
• Direct program support in related areas beyond the acquisition programs’ technical capability or capacity to address</r2:Text>

Verification and test technologies.  Initiating:
•  Improvements to the core JFAC’s (1) technical capability, i.e., laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.  Out-year demands will continue to require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of assessment capabilities.
•  Enhancement of automation needed to increase the throughput of information produced by individual JFAC laboratory tools as well as to facilitate information sharing across the families of tools used for analysis and testing.
•  Development of common SME training and protocols based on the existing tool base, to include both commercial and government-developed tools.
•  Funding for additional SMEs per core JFAC laboratory in support of the microelectronics trust verification and other JFAC-related work.
•  Cost sharing of direct program support prioritized for FY 2017 focused on addressing technical gaps and trust-related findings.
•  Investment in the above technical areas based on priority and monitor and report increased technical capability from the baseline 2016 level.  

Standards and Practices.  Initiating the:
•  Development of standards and best practices, and relationships with industry, to foster commercial development of secure and trusted parts.
•  Establishment of formal relationships with FPGA vendors and other key commercial suppliers to improve device and IP security.
•  Acquisition of government access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop design practices that minimize security flaws and facilitate verification. 
•  Establishment of government and industry working groups to develop test procedures to validate the trust of designs.
•  Documentation and promulgation of security-enhancing design practices across government, industry, and academia.
•  Development of industry-wide standards and practices to establish a common understanding of what constitutes verified and trusted hardware/software/firmware at both the component and systems level.
•  Development of a common lexicon for secure hardware/software/firmware in collaboration with the Committee for National Security Systems, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the broader United States Government, industry, and academia.
•  Definition of supply chain controls for assured chain of custody for critical and other microelectronics devices and IP.
•  Development of security training and educate government and industry system security engineers and material managers on supply chain and life-cycle management best practices using agreed-upon language, standards, and practices.
•  Alignment of DoD Instruction 5200.44 (Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN)), related policies, and NIST 800-161 (Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations) with industry standards identifying and addressing gaps in definition and criteria and establishing accepted levels of supplier and part trustworthiness.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop, and demonstrate the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include SOTA microelectronics, to ensure continued access to leading-edge microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of trust in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom trusted and assured needs is diminishing as leading-edge suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce trusted and assured SOTA parts from untrusted sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It also is intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of microelectronics trust and assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and intellectual property (IP), including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It develops advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Trust techniques, active hardware trust control, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Technologies that provide trust and assurance in a broad range of trusted and un-trusted environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, would enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of third-party IP to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

Beginning in FY 2018, funding for this project has been transferred to BA 4 PE 0604294D8Z and BA 5 PE 0605294D8Z.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

critical to meet the enterprise-wide needs of the procurement community. The requirement for increased ebusiness capabilities may result from statute, regulation or internal control requirements.  This program provides opportunities for the introduction of innovative, time-saving, and cost-saving technologies into procurement processes across the Department. This RDT&amp;E PE provides resources to conduct software development and testing on new or modified e-business applications to ensure mature system development, integration and demonstration of production representative systems and capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Low risk adjustments were taken in shifting focus to automating simple contract closeout, and business intelligence capabilities and to mitigate fiscal reductions. Efficiency Reductions for PB16 were taken along with additional PB16 adjustments to a total of 2.205M from the original President's Budget.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Baseline efforts for this Program Element (PE) were previously funded in PE 0605140D8Z BA 5 and have been transferred to this BA 5 PE to:  (1) change the title from "Trusted Foundry" to "Trusted and Assured Microelectronics"; and (2) correctly align funding in support of the mission.  Additional funds were added in FY 2018 to enable secure design environments with intellectual property (IP) for access to advanced node processes and field programmable gate array (FPGA) Assurance engagement and co-development with commercial vendors.

This PE supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate trust of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize trust as a competitive design standard; and (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to assuring the trust of the microelectronics supply chain in order to enable broader DoD access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.

This activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations and laboratories, defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related S&amp;T activities.  

This activity implements, maintains and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy. Recognizing that trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a Government-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the government.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop, and demonstrate the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include SOTA microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies, while maintaining the required level of trust in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base IP from exploitation.  It also is intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of microelectronics trust and assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and intellectual property (IP), including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Trust techniques, active hardware trust control, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.   It also demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Technologies that provide trust and assurance in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, would enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of third-party IP to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

This project will also support the following:  1) secure design environments, including high-performance computation environments, for collaboration across the U.S. Government and with private innovators to jointly conduct research on areas such as secure verification of hardware; 2) electronic design automation (EDA) tools and cell libraries; 3) persistent expertise to engage with innovation teams and sponsors to develop business models, IP articles and licensing agreements, architectures, and standards that align with U.S. Government interests in assurance and security strategy; and 4) assured field programmable gate array (FPGA) development and product demonstration for commercial FPGAs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

FY18 activities will mature and evaluate trust technologies and techniques through efforts that may include the conduct of studies and Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) and other efforts to coordinate research programs across government research and development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia and industry.

Assess and report technical progress.  Will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, intellectual property (IP), techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0305304D8Z was established in FY2013 and plays a pivotal role in the Department’s ability to achieve audit readiness, enhance the Department’s goal of energy efficiency, gain a full accountability of Real Property assets, as well as improve data quality and integration across the full spectrum of EI&amp;E business functions.  The PE helped conduct a full Business Process Re-engineering of the processes used to collect energy information, and publishing an EEIM data standard and a additional effort to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD EI&amp;E Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements by supporting management and oversight of reconciliation efforts and auditability by determining requirements for the department's Real Property inventory records and asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this capability is an enterprise EI&amp;E Data Analytics &amp; Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with a independent verification &amp; validation capability. With access to real time data through services WSDLS, reports generated through business intelligence provide immediate indicators driving improved and quicker decisions.

In 2015, it was determined that the current state of cyber security of energy-related (and other real property-related) control systems (such as the electronic/computer controls on heating, ventilation &amp; air conditioning equipment) is deficient, and a $1,000,000 increase in FY2016 funding was allocated above the EEIM baseline to support a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  Integration with accurate Real property asset, Utilization, Military Construction, Environmental, and installation Geospatial data is equally key to ensuring these decisions for planning and reporting are possible.  It also supports development of The geospatial portal for visualizing energy layers with other EI&amp;E data on installation or area maps for improved spatial analysis.  This portal is the DOD aggregated repository for DoD Common Installation Picture layers.  Additionally, the map viewer is customized and easier  for OSD senior staff to manipulate and includes an online catalog of maps, documents and data; and a secure, robust data exchange module. This development supports a range of Joint Staff and OSD customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, requires expertise and information access. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners. CWMD Systems is addressing existing gaps and deficiencies through a portfolio of investments. 

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD situational awareness information systems and software applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System, (DRRS,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system under DRRS, presents a number of significant challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The holistic perspective of the application necessitates its need to operate in multiple domains.  Additionally, the highly complex data structures and visualization tools needed to support the Global Force Management - Data Initiative and critical down-stream consumers of readiness information, must now be implemented within DRRS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD.  This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

DRRS expands the scope of readiness reporting within the Department to create a more comprehensive assessment of the total force and its capability to perform the tasks and missions required of it to support the National Military Strategy.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  The program is the keystone for the readiness enterprise and architected to embrace the implementation of the Global Force Management - Data Imitative (GFM-DI), allowing for the Department’s efforts in the realm of Adaptive Planning and Execution to be fully supported.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS.  Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force.  This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements.  The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities.  CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment.  Projects under the CTEIP Program Element (PE) support two basic tasks: investments to improve the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Project (REP)).

    The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of: air combat; armament and munitions; Command, Control Communication, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) and networks; common range instrumentation; electronic combat; cyber warfare; land combat; sea combat; space combat; target systems; and test environments.  Examples of project subject matter include: highly accurate time-space-position information, network enhanced telemetry, electronic warfare test capability developments to address critical testing shortfalls against advanced threats, information assurance and cyber testing and analysis capabilities, ground testing for hypersonic systems, end-to-end testing of infrared countermeasures systems, net-centric weapons and unmanned systems.  CTEIP continues as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges. 

   CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool; to link ranges through internetting to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing; and, to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

   Analyses of alternative solutions are conducted for each investment project to validate T&amp;E requirements, to define integrated support systems, and to determine overall cost effectiveness of the proposed test investments.  The use of Department of Defense (DoD)-wide criteria for requirement validation, prioritization, and risk assessment ensures an effective test resource investment program.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing.  Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability and legacy for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

   This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

The FY2018 Central Test and Evaluation Program budget is described in detail below.  As part of the DoD reform agenda, the CTEIP budget was reduced for consolidation and reduction of service contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program was established for the purpose of implementing the Department’s strategy to move to an enterprise-centric, distributed test capability that results in acquisition systems fielded with enhanced joint capabilities, reduced program costs, and improved acquisition timelines.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the Department of Defense’s “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  JMETC provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that supports system development, interoperability testing, and cyber testing which otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because it is intended to provide test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, JMETC allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  This enables a customer-defined joint mission test environment for systems engineering and testing, extensible to training and experimentation, in a timely and cost effective manner. 

On October 1, 2012, the Under Secretary Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) directed Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) to take responsibility for operations and resources of the National Cyber Range (NCR).  TRMC undertook management oversight of the NCR, including all operational activities and sustainment of resources, transitioning it from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Science &amp; Technology project to an operational capability supporting cyber test, experimentation, and training events. The NCR mission is to provide secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission representative cyberspace environments and facilitate integration/federation of cyberspace T&amp;E infrastructure in support of the TRMC Mission.  The NCR supports diverse set of customers performing Developmental and Operational Testing, Cyber Mission Force Training and Certification, and support for operational contingencies.

The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is the Department’s lead for the JMETC program, the National Cyber Range, and oversees both their development and operations.  In order to meet the significant growth in requirements, TRMC will use the increased funding for FY 2018 to substantially increase cyber test and training capacity by 1) refurbishing the current NCR hardware that is nearing end-of-life and increasing computing capacity to support additional customers; 2) procuring and fielding additional enterprise computational and storage resources for JMETC’s Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDPs) capability; and 3) begin construction of a new high capacity cyber range similar to the NCR.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMETC mission is to provide an enterprise-level, persistent capability for linking distributed facilities, enabling Department of Defense (DoD) customers to develop and test warfighting capabilities in a Joint Context. JMETC provides a test infrastructure consisting of the components necessary to conduct Joint distributed test events by cost-effectively integrating live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) test resources that are configured to support the users' needs.  The JMETC program provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC products and the conduct of distributed testing.  JMETC’s institutional funding builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; identification and development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  JMETC Program funding also provides JMETC program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Key attributes of the JMETC include:  persistency; interoperability; reuse; various combinations of distributed capabilities (reconfigurable infrastructure to meet customer requirements); modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) linkage; Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) test resource integration; and distributed test support to satisfy both Service and Joint needs.  System engineering, training, and experimentation all benefit from a corporate JMETC developed for T&amp;E.  JMETC has grown from four sites in 2007 to well over 100 functional sites by the end of FY16 with several more planned for FY17.  JMETC will reduce the cost and time to plan and prepare for distributed joint testing by providing a readily-available, persistent connectivity with network security accreditation support, common integration software for linking sites, and accredited test tools for distributed testing. To support its customers, JMETC also provides extensive expertise in planning, preparing for, and executing the infrastructure for distributed test events.  Additionally in FY 2013, the JMETC PE was funded to develop and field the Regional Service Deliver Points (RSDP).  The RSDPs are a set of distributed computing and storage platforms designed to efficiently meet DoD capacity and capability demands for distributed and cyber test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements as part of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).  They provide services (i.e. traffic generation, simulation, instrumentation, visualization, and integrated event management), a scalable architecture to increase capacity and capabilities as needed by the user community, a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to support users requirements which are prone to frequent change, and to deliver cost and performance efficiencies (virtualization, rapid reconstitution).  At a high-level architecture view, the RSDP adds enterprise compute and storage resources as well as a platform for distributed and cyber T&amp;E tools and services at multiple classifications necessary to create high fidelity, operationally representative virtual environments, previously unavailable.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As a result of recent recapitalization and capacity enhancement efforts, the NCR now has the capability to support up to 8 concurrent events and scale up to ~250K virtual nodes. The NCR concurrently emulates complex (Red/Blue/Gray) operationally representative network environments at different classification levels using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) architecture. The NCR Test Automation Tool Suite minimizes human error, enables verification of test environment, ensures repeatable results and reduces event timelines from weeks/months to hours/days.  NCR computing assets can be sanitized after exposure to malicious attacks/malware and restored to a known, clean state. The NCR conducts distributed events with other Cyberspace Ranges via the JMETC MILS Network (JMN) and Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR). 

The NCR conducts Cyberspace Testing, Training and Operational Events for the full spectrum of DoD Customers including Research, Development, Acquisition, Testing, Training and Operational Cyber Mission Forces. The NCR executes wide variety of event types including Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Demonstrations, Developmental Test &amp; Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (OT&amp;E), Security Controls Assessments (SCA), Cyberspace Operations Training, Cyberspace Tactics, Techniques Procedures (TTP) Development, Forensics/Malware Analysis) and Cyberspace Operations Mission Rehearsal. The NCR enables acquisition programs to conduct Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) in a representative Cyberspace Environment to identify and close exposed vulnerabilities, evaluate resiliency and positively impact program cost, schedule and performance. The NCR also supports Training and Certification of Cyber Mission Forces in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment. Finally, the NCR is supporting in real time Overseas Contingency Operations as directed by National Authority.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2016, the Department, as a result of a study conducted by DASD(C3&amp;CB), realized the magnitude of need for increased cyber test and training capacity and capability.  Based on this and other inputs, the Department made the decision to increase funding in the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in FY 17 to build out additional cyber T&amp;E capacity based on the National Cyber Range (NCR) architecture. This increased capacity will also be available to conduct training for the Cyber Mission Force.  The TRMC worked with the Services to identify facilities where this buildout could be accomplished most efficiently.  They also considered additional criteria such as accessibility by acquisition programs, availability of qualified work force, utilities and network availability, timing, and expected cost.  

To date, TRMC and the Services have identified five sites that are potential candidates.  We have begun design and cost estimation in FY16 so that we can begin detailed design and begin build-out in FY 17.  Once complete, the Department will have well over four times the cyber test and training capacity offered by the current NCR.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Studies and analyses will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections. With the complexities of emerging security threats in the current geopolitical environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Studies and analyses will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections. With the complexities of emerging security threats in the current geopolitical environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning for the mid and long-term is vital.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This program conducts approximately seventy-five actions per fiscal year to support a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives, the Quadrennial Defense Review, the President's National Security Strategy, and the National Military Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope of studies and analyses has been limited as necessary in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance to the Department of Defense while continuing to make every effort to support requirements for the Office of the Secretary of Defense developing from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the duties as described in Title 10 US Code, Section 139, the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering (DASD(SE)) is the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) on systems engineering, development planning, program protection and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DASD(SE) develops policies and guidance for (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, system security and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability, maintainability, and software and hardware assurance, on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs) and major automated information systems (MAISs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) and program protection plans (PPPs) for MDAPs and MAISs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainability; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering, assurance and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DASD(SE) develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into system engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DASD(SE) reviews and approves the SEP and PPP for each MDAP and MAIS, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering, program protection and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense or the USD(AT&amp;L).  Based on the DASD(SE)’s continuous program engagement, the DASD(SE) advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense and the USD(AT&amp;L) regarding systems engineering, development planning, program protection and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DASD(SE) provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, program protection planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DASD(SE) also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements, to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

The DASD(SE) issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  DASD(SE) improves DoD’s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy and guidance in:  acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality &amp; Manufacturing (PQM); Engineering Tools and Environments; and Specialty Engineering.  

The DASD(SE) periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  The DASD(SE) prepares and submits a bi-annual report to Congress on systems engineering activities and effectiveness.

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DASD(SE) in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of DASD(SE) systems engineering and technical reviews.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This work also includes improvements to processes that support registration and storage of the Department's enterprise architecture (formerly called DARS). The Department maintains a catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to store, search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data through capabilities provided by the architecture portal.  The portal is a central, federated hub for discovery, accessibility, understandability, and reusability of architectures.  With the ability to import different architecture tool data and display disparate architecture data in a uniform, consistent method for ease of use and understanding.  The portal provides a federated environment for sharing of architectures, mission threads, and other related capability integrated information between various authoritative repositories to increase effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making in a dynamic environment by our customers.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the Defense Architecture Support program focus on: (1) Research and Development of JIE and MPE architectures, (2) Making JIE and MPE architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build "composite" integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO's collaborate in the development of federation web services via the Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Panel under the oversight of the DoD CIOs Enterprise Architecture and Service Board to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model, enterprise services, data and technical standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The research and development of the tools will continue to increase the capabilities of MASSC (conferencing capabilities), NC3-N ExAMS (analysis of nodes, metrics and assets associated with a Navy communications system) and NISM (provide extendable, transparent multi-level simulation of scenarios).

$1.517 million – Update and maintain the NLCC Capabilities Roadmap (timeline format).  Develop the As-is and To-be Functional Enterprise Architectures for the NLCC as well as a high-level 2030 view of the NLCC Enterprise. Develop a set of Architecture Guiding Principles and Major Thrust Areas that will help decompose the Objective Architecture into technology areas that can be addressed by the Reference Architecture. Review existing program and service-level architectures for consistency with the overall Enterprise Architecture and drive the revamped NLCC Roadmap and Investment Strategy to move forward.

– Perform financial database analysis and use the RDOCs and PDOCs to create a new structure for the NLCC Investment Strategy.
Build automatic extraction tools for the RDOCs and PDOCs. Develop program lists using programmatic data in Excel. Develop a XML Parser to move data to into a single database to work on Schedule Views (GANTT) and move to roadmap format, starting as a manual process, leading to an automated process.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>(U) The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II awards are made to firms that have been awarded a Phase I contract on the basis of the results of their Phase I effort and the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)) and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the ASD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the ASD(R&amp;E) provides technical support to the USD(AT&amp;L) on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the ASD(R&amp;E) (OASD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the ASD(R&amp;E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.

The PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the ASD(R&amp;E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program, and ensures that the technology being developed is affordable and minimizes system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis project conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds and to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the ASD(R&amp;E).  The ASD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

The PE provides funding for Critical Technology Assessments within ASD(R&amp;E).  Critical Technology Assessments provide the technical reference guidance in support of development and implementation of DoD technology security policies on international transfers of defense related goods, services, and technologies.  The program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  

This PE also provides funding for Data Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The DoD Laboratory Enterprise consists of more than 60 laboratories with approximately 67,000 employees (approximately 40,000 of whom are scientists and engineers).   The Defense Laboratory Office develops plans and investment strategies for laboratory infrastructure, technology programs, and personnel development. Section 211 of the FY17 NDAA also transferred the management of the laboratory demonstration program at Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratories (STRLs) from USD(P&amp;R) to the ASD(R&amp;E). This transition requires additional resources and personnel to manage the day-to-day needs of processing lab demo authorities. A human resources specialist with experience managing unique personnel authorities will help in managing this increased workload.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

However, previous year (FY 2015) language stated:  "The agreement includes $10,000,000 above the budget request for a regionally focused technology transfer innovation pilot program.  The agreement directs the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to conduct a pilot program on public-private technology transfer ventures between Department of Defense research and development centers and regionally focused technology incubators, with the goal of increasing the commercialization of intellectual property developed in the Department's research and development enterprise in support of critical cross-service technological needs such as energetics, unmanned systems, and rapid prototyping.  Technology incubator partners should be selected through full and open competition emphasizing strong business plans, demonstrated expertise in mentorship and commercialization, and strong regional partnerships.  This language does not replace the report language on Technology Transfer included under Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force in Senate Report 113-211."

The add was transferred to the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) for execution. AMRDEC has drafted the Partnership Intermediary Agreement Work Description, the topic of which is “Technology Transfer, Avionics Technology, and Teaming for Future Tactical Operations Challenges.” This will be applied to both aviation and unmanned platforms and will be competed amongst a variety of institutions, including those in academia.</r2:Text>

The export control program provides an ongoing assessment and analysis of global goods and technologies; determines significant advances in the development, production, and use of military capabilities by potential adversaries; and determines goods and technologies being developed worldwide with potential to significantly enhance or degrade U.S. military capabilities in the future.  Identified in the Export Administration Act of 1979, and extended by Presidential Executive Order, to review militarily critical goods and technologies, and to consider worldwide technology capabilities, the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) is a congressionally-mandated source document for identification of leading edge and current technologies monitored worldwide for national security, nonproliferation control of weapons of mass destruction, and advanced conventional weapons. 

Specific activities include:
- Monitor and assess dual-use and military technologies worldwide.
- Assist in the development of proposals for negotiation in various multilateral export control regimes.
- Provide limited worldwide technology capability assessments for the MCTL and other U.S. international critical technologies efforts.
- Identify and determine technical parameters for proposals for international control of weapons of mass destruction.
- Identify foreign technologies of interest to the DoD and opportunities for international cooperative research and development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks, and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources to support Acquisition Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&amp;E Organizations in the development of comprehensive and efficient DT&amp;E strategies to support key acquisition milestones and engineering decisions.  This project also manages the Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and prepares reports report to Congress as required.  Specific activities include the following:

- The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense DT&amp;E (DASD(DT&amp;E)) ensures that test strategies beginning at Milestone A, are documented in the Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  DASD(DT&amp;E) reviews and approves/disapproves the developmental test and evaluation strategy within the TEMPs.
- Provide formal DT&amp;E Assessments prior to major milestone decisions to inform the acquisition decision-makers on the readiness of programs to release the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request For Proposal (RFP) pre Milestone B, and begin production, Milestone C, with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle. 
- Managing the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last 4 years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 83 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $150M.
- Coordinate with the Test Resources Management Center (TRMC) to identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the TRMC strategic plan.
- Coordinate with the Director of Systems Engineering (SE) to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the SE and development planning processes of the Department.
- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- As the T&amp;E Functional Leader, establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&amp;E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Investments support DoD's current and emerging OPSEC capability gaps, including countering advances in non-U.S. ISR capabilities and denying understanding of U.S. capability, capacity, and readiness.  These investments spur Department innovation and preserve U.S. technology superiority.  Produced prototypes lead the community's ability to sustain and maximize technology advantage as they are transitioned to Service and Agency programs for sustainment, maintenance, and capacity programming.  Test and evaluation analyses establish measure and countermeasure effectiveness in current and emerging operational environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• RDT&amp;E OPSEC capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures signature management and signature obfuscation capabilities are available for DoD components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of OPSEC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E performance metrics are used to establish baseline and assess progress toward enhancement and increase of OPSEC capabilities and capacities across the DoD’s assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for OPSEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E
successes across the Department:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address CCMD and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• Acquire and sustain MILDEC capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures information related capabilities are available for DoD components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing governance, oversight, and strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of MILDEC activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E performance metrics are among the metrics used to establish the baseline and assess progress toward revitalization of MILDEC capabilities and capacities across the DoD's assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are based on the return on investment of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E successes across the Department:

Performance metrics are measured through an increase of MILDEC capability and capacity as demonstrated by the following:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered prototypes and next generation capabilities address CCMD and DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed prototype development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of prototypes and next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, requires expertise and information access. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners. CWMD Systems is addressing existing gaps and deficiencies through a portfolio of investments. 

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, requires expertise and information access. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners. CWMD Systems is addressing existing gaps and deficiencies through a portfolio of investments. 

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Development of new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.

This project funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program transfers to the Joint Staff (PE 0804767J) beginning in FY 2018.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a Joint Training Environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  The funding increase beginning in FY 2016 represents planned growth and internal reprogramming decisions to accelerate development of a cloud-enabled joint training environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Joint Simulation System (JSS)
- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)
- U.S. Forces Korea Training &amp; Exercise Support (USFK)
- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)
- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and SOF joint training and enabling capabilities that improve interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint collective training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. The enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program will focus efforts on improving, rather than consuming, readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System (JSS) provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  The JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable Joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO and multinational partners. The Joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS’s intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the JS J7 program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD T2 JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, and reporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, IA training; and OSD required training (externally funded).  JKO also expends funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance specific aspects of the training capability as required for J7 support to Combatant Commanders. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide the CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content.

USFK:  FY 2015 is the last year for dedicated funding within the overall program.  The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program develops simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) is a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution will be capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution will contain enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JLVC 2020 simulations.  

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based capabilities for integration into the JLVC environment.  The Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements, and significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable the Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program will enable Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate.  The funding requested continues development of exercise Scenario Management Tools and services that support planning and execution of joint training, and continued maturation of a single integrating architecture for Joint Training.  Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services.  Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding.  Focus must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in the warfighter’s operational environment.  JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2017, this investment continues expanding access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training.  Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate/link joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes, and accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating specific actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience.  This enhances the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  Funding in this account supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  Technical integration enables selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command Headquarter levels.  The funding supports modernization of the Joint Training Environment (JTE) to increase warfighter access to automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) through web-based and cloud capabilities. 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the Joint Force to be responsive to the warfighters’ pace of changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed JLVC enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and CJCS High Interest Training Issues identified in the Chairman’s Annual Training Guidance.</r2:Description>

Conducted (3) development events, (3) software integration events, (3) Korea Command Bridge tests to support the Pacific theater, (1) verification event and  and (2) validation events in preparation for Joint Live Virtual Constructive v1.0 due for release December 2016.
• Transitioned from DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation process to Risk Management Framework.  This increased cybersecurity focus came with additional requirements adopted in the development effort and sustainment of current capabilities. 
• In May 2016, published the Joint Training Synthetic Environment Modeling and Simulation Roadmap that implements the Joint training project plan outlined in the Information Systems -Initial Capabilities Document.  The roadmap codifies various use cases, capability gaps, capability requirements, and functional requirements. 
• Integrated security services into the newly developed Joint Training Tools establishing a single sign-on capability supporting most joint Training Enterprise Network services. 
• Released Joint Training Data Services version 4.2 which includes a web-enabled, enhanced Order of Battle Service and a new Terrain Generation Service capability.  Order of Battle Service provides enhanced capability to produce simulation ready force data. Terrain Generation Services provides individual users' ability to request and receive simulation ready terrain for several simulations with plans to support more simulations.  Terrain Generation Service also provides the ability to layer content over standard geographic maps to enrich the standard information available on the map.
•  Completed the overarching and comprehensive data model supporting the new web-services based Joint Training Tool software architecture.
•Within a cloud construct, leveraged current technologies to lessen the burden of specific physical machines and allow quicker build and tear-down of systems through virtualization.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DoD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKO is tasked to develop a DoD enterprise-wide, Joint Individual Training Toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD(P&amp;R) CE2T2 Program Goals &amp; Objectives guidance, CJCS High Interest Training Issues, Joint Staff J7 training priorities, and JKO Stakeholder (Combatant Commands, Services, and Combat Support Agencies) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the Joint Content Management Architecture including: 
•  JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military  training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit.  JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses and track/report students' progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements.  There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS. 
•  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF ‘battle staffs’ will be adequately trained, as individuals and the staffs collectively, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and pre-requisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the Joint Event Learning Cycle and in meeting combatant commanders exercise objectives. 
•  JKO mobile application training device development: Development and enhancements facilitate the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (cell pones and tablets). JKO Mobile App extends access to training courses and learning resources to personal use of mobile phones and tablets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Requirements were derived from  CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness (DASD(R) for JKO to "develop content for pre-exercise training and support-as required by the Army, Marine Corps and supported GCCs and support individual and unit training for REF/SP-MAGTF missions." These enhancements have improved the ease of use for the current ~40,000 daily log-ins and ~450,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS reflect the software requirements needed to ensure cyber security. Improvements also benefited thousands of individuals by easing their requirement to complete mandatory join individual web-based training as a precursor to their participation in numerous CCMD exercise training events. 
• Developed, tested and delivered multiple JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the LCMS. JKO updated products and services are derived from practical application in the field.  CCMD  user feedback contributes to a more effective and efficient training capability, improving the OSD endorsed Blended Learning Training component of CCMD collective training exercises.   The JKO SGST capability was leveraged to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C/JTF 'battle staffs' in preparation for USTRANSCOM's, USNORTHCOM's, USSOUTHCOM's, USPACOM's, and USEUCOM's collective training exercises.  Individual training proficiency improvement  was measured and quantified  as a key component of the exercise design.  DoD mandated network cyber security enhancements were successfully integrated in the release. 
• Assessed, refined and continued executing JKO's comprehensive plan to develop mobile training device capabilities focused on JKO's entire Joint Individual Training Toolkit. Provided  JKO courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices (cell phones and tablets).  Leveraged and ported numerous other DoD agency, interagency and multinational training courseware to JKO Mobile app.  A good example is OSD's Transition Veterans Program Office training on JKO Mobile which benefited military members significantly in transitioning to civilian life.  JKO developed, converted, tested, and delivered  ~120 mobile training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos via the JKO Mobile App on both Apple and Android platforms.</r2:Text>

Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by DASD(R) for JKO to “develop content for pre-exercise training and support—as required by the Army, Marine Corps and supported GCCs—and support individual and unit training for REF/SP-MAGTF missions.”  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve cybersecurity and the ease of use for the current 40,000 daily log-ins and 450,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by easing their requirement to access, complete and retain mandatory joint individual web-based training. Additionally, this retention benefits them as a precursor to their participation in numerous CCMD exercise training events.  JKO must continue to evaluate and enhance its architecture to maintain performance standards and remain on the leading edge of distant learning technology as we confront an austere fiscal environment and the tremendous demand of JKO capabilities.  
• Develop, test, and deliver 4 JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD endorsed Blended Learning Training component in approximately 8 CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C/JTF ‘battle staffs’.  Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  Additionally, SGST is expected to support enhancement of  the SEJPME training by enabling synchronous and asynchronous CAPSTONE-type capability.  JKO will continue to enhance functionality based on user experience and feedback. 
• JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to develop mobile training device capabilities focused on JKO’s entire Joint Individual Training Toolkit.  Planned components include existing JKO courseware and video conversions to portable, hand-held devices, emerging FY 2017 training courseware requirements interoperable with portable, hand-held devices while leveraging of other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware for delivery on the JKO Mobile App. JKO plans develop or convert approximately 150 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in the reduction in costs for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.  JKO will continue to enhance its mobile capability based on user experience and feedback.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Training &amp; Exercise Support program developed simulations capable of satisfying all joint exercise training requirements in the Korean Theater of Operations.  Interoperability with the Republic of Korea-developed Korean Simulation System (KSIMS) was a critical and unique requirement of this USFK RDT&amp;E program.  This solution is capable of interoperating in a common battle space that realistically represents the operating environment to all levels of training audiences -- tactical to strategic -- in Korean theater exercises.  While supporting USFK’s specific requirements, this solution contains enhancements that will benefit other combatant commander training programs that use the aging Joint, Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) simulations and the emerging JTSE (previously JLVC 2020) simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Fund for Innovative Results and Execution (FIRE) combines three industrial base programs focused on innovation, urgent needs and accelerated deployment.  The program element is inherited from the Title 10-directed Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program (Title 10 USC Section 2508.)  The other two programs formerly existed as congressional plus-ups, the Industrial Base Innovation Fund (IBIF) and the National Security Technology Accelerator.  FIRE makes investments in manufacturing research and development that address any of the following areas:  1)Urgent production requirements and diminishing defense manufacturing sources and material shortages, and a sustainable defense design team base; 2) Model-based engineering and integrated computational materials engineering; and 3) New, innovative technologies being developed through public-private partnerships. The FIRE addresses strategic shortfalls especially surge production and diminishing sources and is intended to address these specific shortcomings by applying a broad range of tools to amplify interest from non-traditional suppliers and accelerate implementation via experimentation, demonstration and rapid transition.  FIRE projects will be structured with an enhanced focus on competition, timeliness, and transition to operation. 

These FIRE projects will be chosen from documented industrial base issues in consultation with the Services and Agencies. Projects will address needs that span several Services and Agencies.  Buy-in and planning will be critical elements in terms of attracting interest to start a project and transiting from an innovative idea to reality.  Projects will require substantial pre-negotiated paths from problem identification through incorporation into a real product or system.

Congressional guidance for industrial base investment often addresses urgency.  The FIRE program will pursue innovation in acquisition as well as technology.  There will be a special emphasis on reaching non-traditional suppliers as sources of innovation.  Non-traditional and under-utilized funding mechanisms, such as Other Transaction Authority (OTA), will be emphasized.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The IBAS program has a two-pronged approach to identify projects: 1) periodic assessments of the national technology and industrial base by the OSD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&amp;L) office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (MIBP) as directed by 10 U.S. Code 2505, and 2) a call for projects to industry.  MIBP collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base where current spending on production and research is insufficient to keep critical capabilities viable.  While industrial base risks are mitigated primarily through the direct engagement of prime contractors, program managers and military departments, exceptional cases require a more direct defense-wide intervention strategy. This Defense-wide Fund for Innovative Results and Execution (FIRE) program element, directed by Title 10 USC Section 2508, provides the Department with that means.

All projects are evaluated for industrial base risk using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted.  In addition to the gating criteria of fragility and criticality, additional factors for project selection include: 
•	An identifiable path of transition to production with a very high probability of being needed in the short to medium term. 
•	The capability is unlikely to be available in the absence of the proposed support.
•	Analysis showing that the project results in a positive return on investment.

FIRE investments are focused on three broad industry groupings:  1) Missiles and Munitions, 2) Space, and 3) Other industrial base niches.  Priority is given to investments that cut across multiple platforms and services.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This has a significant impact on current and future missile programs, limiting the readiness and availability of superior technology to U.S. Warfighters.  The missile sector sustainment will exercise the design and production skills of this critical industrial base by improving existing production processes, exploring advanced materials for higher performance, and upgrading outdated technology for missile components. A missile sector Fragility and Criticality assessment has highlighted the need for specific action to preserve industrial base capabilities for fuzes and thermal batteries.</r2:Description>

This is a defense-unique industrial base niche.  The project developed a new Solid Divert and Attitude Control Systems (SDACS) diverter valve with advanced structural insulators and high-temperature seals.   The primary purpose was preservation of design team capabilities for Solid Divert and Attitude Control Systems (SDACS).  Funding research to sustain DACS competition is a specifically stated Congressional concern.

Butanetriol (BT):  Completed work to develop a qualified domestic source for BT, a solid rocket propellant precursor chemical, precluding the necessity of procurement from a prohibited foreign source. Since 2008, DoD’s projected requirements have shrunk to levels that made it uneconomical for domestic suppliers to develop BT production capability. IBAS funded a cost-sharing project with the new supplier to retrofit an existing Dihydrofuran reactor, modify pumping, plumbing, heat management and process controls to an existing reactor, relocate existing atmospheric storage tank for waste collection and modify the discharge filtering system of an existing reactor.

Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD): Because of the decline in missile production, fuzes are experiencing a decline in production, making the industrial base very fragile.  Without intervention, loss of industry design and production expertise is expected for ESAD-based fuzes. ESADs are most commonly used in missile fuzing, but have applicability to some of the Department’s most critical gun fired and air delivered munitions as well.  To improve the industrial base capability, IBAS is funding EASD design projects for cost reduction and commonality across multiple missile and munition end-products.  Phase I was initiated by contracting with three different suppliers to exercise their engineering capability, including the use of sub-tier suppliers and component technology, to develop lower cost, common architecture ESAD designs.  These three suppliers form the critical core of the US Industrial Base for fuzes overall.  Phase II is planned for award in FY 2017.  In this phase the work from Phase I will then be applied against a post milestone C munition which can benefit the most from an upgraded fuze capability. 

Low Energy Exploding Foil Initiators (LEEFI):  This fuze project was initiated to develop a backup manufacturing capability for LEEFIs.  LEEFIs are a critical subcomponent used in all Electronic Safe and Arm Devices ESADs.  The current production facility is the sole source for LEEFI fuzes used in a wide variety of DoD missile programs.  The ability to manufacture these specialized initiators at an alternate location eliminates the risk of a single point of failure that has the potential to hobble production on all missile programs simultaneously.

Thermal Batteries: Similar to the issue with fuzes, the decline in missile production has made the industrial base for thermal batteries very fragile.  Production is falling below minimum sustaining rates.  IBAS has initiated three projects for thermal battery technical improvements in battery materials and shelf life that will lower minimum sustaining rates:  improved material composition that will provide additional domestic suppliers, characterization of Thermal Battery shelf-life model to enhance production quality and sustainment (reducing costs and industrial base burden), and improved thin film production to broaden and improve the market.</r2:Text>

Solid Rocket Motors:  For the purpose of sustaining at-risk critical design skills, DoD will conduct advanced propulsion system technology development, maturation and demonstration that advance the state-of-the-art in propulsion component, sub-system and system solutions that enable enhanced multi-mission capabilities.  The focus will be: (1) improving and maintaining design engineering capability and knowledge base in the areas of advanced propellant formulations, case/nozzle/insulation approaches, ignition systems, energy management approaches, and safety enhancements; (2) implementation of propulsion solutions that advance state-of-the-art in mission flexibility, agility, volumetric/mass efficiency, and affordability; and (3) demonstration of a down-selected integrated flight-type propulsion solution that effectively demonstrates that the critical technological elements can function together in a relevant environment.</r2:Text>

This will further exercise the critical fuze industrial base along with the sub-tier suppliers as pre-qualification prototype quantities will be manufactured after the design from phase I is further refined for the selected application.  The end production will not only be to have successfully supported this critical industrial base, but to also pave the way for the warfighter to receive a higher quality upgraded capability from a munition system. Application of ESAD designs as common architecture to multiple missiles and munitions during this phase enables realization of the desired cost savings.

Thermal Batteries: The thermal battery industrial sector initiative will continue with a call for proposals for FY 2017 and 2018.  The primary focus for FY 2017-2018 time period will be on improvements within product characteristics and production methods, and development of new technologies which enable the sustainment of the industrial base while meeting Department of Defense requirements.   The thermal battery industrial sector will continue to be assessed to ensure existing and emerging requirements are developed to support National Security Directives.

The supplier cannot fund this at their own expense. Without funding to perform space qualification work, the products will not be ready for use when needed and the supplier is highly likely to leave the business. Work was initiated to perform final space qualification work and avoid the much higher cost of developing replacement products with an alternative supplier.

National Security Space Programs: Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) infrared sensors permit highest performance and highest technical and manufacturing readiness levels for tactical/strategic/space applications.  Volumes for MCT wafer fab production in 2014 plummeted 60% below historical annual average for the past seven years. Forecast volumes to fall another 50% next year, far below the minimum number per year to maintain this critical technology.  IBAS initiated work to identify cost drivers and develop improvements in space-based sensors.  This builds upon Defense Wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (ManTech) work on material for MCT infrared focal plane arrays.</r2:Text>

High Performance Carbon Fiber: A number of specialized (high-strength and high modulus) carbon fibers are critical to manufacturing composite structures for all types of major U.S. space military and civilian programs  (e.g., satellites, space launch vehicles, spacecraft and a wide ride range of missile systems).  Key carbon fibers for these applications are unique, essential (not readily substitutable) and proprietary to a single producer/single factory in one foreign country (Japan).  This foreign, single point-of-failure source of supply, of materials critical to essentially all major high priority space programs, is vulnerable to many severe and long-lasting supply disruption risks (e.g., natural disaster, industrial accidents, future Asia conflicts, foreign government controls and higher foreign commercial market priorities.  Regarding the latter, U.S. program carbon fiber use typically represents a small fraction of total global demand.  Carbon fibers recently developed in the U.S. and commercialized for civilian applications are promising alternatives to imports.  They represent a competitive second source, a more assured supply, cost less, and reportedly perform equal to or better than imports.  Historically, U.S. government programs have relied on single foreign sourced legacy materials and funding is often not available in government programs to test and qualify alternative second sources.  FY 2016 IBAS funds will be used to test and qualify U.S. second sources of commercially available carbon fibers.  With strong cooperation from industry primes, lower tier and material suppliers -- a significant list of promising U.S. government qualification program opportunities are identified for FY 2016 execution (e.g., multiple satellites, missiles and “other” systems).  Planned IBAS projects represent low technology risks, have well defined and near-term program transition points and are low-cost relative to significant industry investments in new, domestically manufactured carbon fiber supplies.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command needs and research initiatives. 

A focal point of this program is development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, is time-consuming and difficult. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners.  

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Software development for new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. 

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Information Systems Initial Capabilities Document for CWMD Situational Awareness on 23 December 2015, which identifies the need for a family of systems to mitigate capability gaps identified by the Combatant Commands. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and direction for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities.  Gaining situational awareness of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and risks, as well as U.S. and international efforts to counter WMD proliferation, is time-consuming and difficult. Relevant information is spread across disconnected systems, on multiple networks, and in the open source domain, making it difficult to discover and use information to support mission needs. WMD-related situations in recent years, including the removal of chemical weapons from Syria and the response to the West African Ebola outbreak, have demonstrated the need for Combatant Commands to access and share CWMD information, collaborate on planning and operations, and have a common understanding of the operational environment with mission partners.  

The CWMD Systems program provides funding for two technology-enabled fusion cells at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which utilize information systems and applications to enable CWMD situational awareness. Existing DoD information systems, networks, and applications are utilized and/or modified using CWMD Systems funding. Software development for new applications reuses software to the extent possible. The DTRA and DIA cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

The CWMD Systems program utilizes four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (ORC-2531).

This Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. 

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD CIO Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides for focused research, development, testing and integration of technology and technical solutions critical to the Defense Cybersecurity and Information Assurance Program to meet the requirements of 10 USC 2224 (Defense Information Assurance Program), 44 USC 3544, (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002), OMB Circular A-130, and DoD Directives/Instructions 8500, 8510, 8520, 8530, and 8540.  This program is funded under Budget activity 7, Operational System Development because it integrates technology and technical solutions to the Defense Information Assurance Program.

ISSP RDT&amp;E funds support the DoD CIO and its mission partners on architecting, engineering, and technical matters for developing governance processes and structures; on evolving and enabling a more integrated and synchronized Joint Information Environment (JIE) to provide the means for more integrated information sharing and collaboration that also endeavors to close identified gaps across all mission areas with a shared network of core enterprise services; on the continued development of the U.S. Government’s ability to prevent and defend against adversarial and/or commercial information and communications technology supply-chain attacks on its mission critical systems, networks, and devices; on improving oversight of the life-cycle management of cybersecurity risks; and on the integration of cybersecurity standards, methods, and procedures across the DoD for a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue to develop, refine, and implement a Joint Information Environment single security architecture strategy, and the related strategic metrics and enhanced analytical capabilities.

•	Developed strategies for successful defenses and operations in the event of sophisticated cyber adversaries and large-scale cyber incidents, analyses &amp; development of metrics focused on the cybersecurity domain, on cybersecurity scorecard and automation, analyses to support policy development and refinement, oversight, and formulation of programmatic advice, and analyses to support various collaborative advisory and governance bodies.

•	Researched means of assessing and prioritizing supply-chain threats and responses, for training regarding threats and risks, and for program protection plans to address supply-chain risks, to help ensure implementation of consistent protection practices from supply chain exploitation and attack within/by individual procurements of materiel and services on which the DoD systems, networks, and missions depend..

•	Developed paradigm of threat-based system-security-engineering, including generation of critical design artifacts (threat analyses, risk analyses, system-of- system-security architectures), and with demonstrated applications to space systems and mission partner environment (MPE).

•	Continued to develop a more robust governance mechanism to minimize supply chain risks across the DoD components and activities, and to develop an overarching international standard, or an improved integrated family of existing standards, for improving supply-chain-risk-management.

•	Continued developing the means for improved mission assurance, mitigation analyses, and vulnerability detection via hardware and software testing, and for acquisitions that are better integrated with informed threat prospects.

•	Developed and published supportive standards, guidance, and processes on the web-based Knowledge Service, for the continual reauthorization and cyber strengthening of information systems, and in satisfaction of requirements mandated by OMB Circular A-130.

•	Supported key acquisition programs-of-record (i.e., Major Automated Information Systems; Major Defense Acquisition Programs, and other special interest developmental and acquisition activities) to drive the development and implementation of more effective cybersecurity strategies, risk management plans, and processes.

                                                    <r2:Description>Request supports the Long Term Competitions (LTC) program which is an analytical effort chartered to provide the DoD senior leadership with an understanding of key long-term developments and dynamics in specific areas of the global security environment, and to develop competitive strategies for their consideration as the Department seeks to address these long term challenges.  The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.
Assessments of the ability of future forces to achieve objectives at the campaign level. These assessments include wargaming, qualitative, and quantitative analytic methods. They will both inform and be informed by the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) defense planning scenarios (DPS). They will identify risk and potential trade-space among force structure, capabilities, and readiness to inform senior leader decision-making.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>IMD project supports the Department’s governance process for balancing IMD supply and demand and addressing how to modernize IMD generation.  IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following: for weapon systems to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; to optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and to support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The acquisition, management, and contracting strategy involves the following:
•	Adhere to guidance outlined in the DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
•	Acquire and sustain IMD capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures information related capabilities are available for DoD components.
•	Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
•	Support advanced weapons programs need for intelligence at the earliest point in the acquisition of the program.
												
RDTE performance metrics are used to assess the progress toward integrating intelligence mission data into the acquisition cycle.  The following metrics focus on the return of investment of RDTE activities and assess the degree to meeting mission goals:
•	Measure percent of funds that are used to improve advanced weapons platforms intelligence integration.  Goal is 100%.
•	Measure percent of advanced weapons systems platforms that have a complete IMD requirements and IMD production baseline.
•	Identify crucial points in the acquisition timeline in which IMD requirements are identified and incorporated.  
•	Reduce the number of weapons programs without fully supported IMD requirements.
•	Reduce the timeline to incorporate IMD studies into weapons programs.
•	Increase the ROI of studies performed.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

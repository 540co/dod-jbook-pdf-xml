            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program executes and provides technical and programmatic support to the testing, evaluation, and mitigation of effects of nuclear weapon employment that impact Air Force systems with initial emphasis on existing nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and associated communications systems.  It includes facilities and equipment required to perform testing, risk assessments, survivability/vulnerability studies, and effectiveness evaluation of various mitigation strategies.  It includes modeling and simulation efforts for systems of systems analysis where assessments are not possible through testing alone.  This program will recommend upgrades to existing/fielded systems as well as informing requirements for future (modernization/recapitalization) systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0604222F, project 674237, Electronic Magnetic Pulse (EMP), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program executes and provides technical and programmatic support to the testing, evaluation, and mitigation of effects of nuclear weapon employment that impact Air Force systems with initial emphasis on existing nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and associated communications systems.  It includes facilities and equipment required to perform testing, risk assessments, survivability/vulnerability studies, and effectiveness evaluation of various mitigation strategies.  It includes modeling and simulation efforts for systems of systems analysis where assessments are not possible through testing alone.  This program will recommend upgrades to existing/fielded systems as well as informing requirements for future (modernization/recapitalization) systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.

Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training.  This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment Desktop Training System.

T-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to Joint Primary Aircraft Training System including studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to the T-6 Aircraft, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages and development activities related to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages. Included is development for the Federal Aviation Administration mandated ACAT III program for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out and associated upgrades.

T-38 program will continue development in FY2017 and FY2018 of a replacement Mission Display Processor, refurbishment of the existing Heads-Up Display, development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast solution as well as replacement of the Very High Frequency Communication radio system and the Very High Frequency Navigation system. System testing is projected to begin in FY2017 and production and deployment of the replacement the systems will begin in late FY2018 and continue through FY2021. 

The FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $5.354 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances. 

In FY 2016 T-6 Avionics Upgrades for FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Compliance was a new start. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT). URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons. Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System (DTS) to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU). PRIME has completed 6 Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators.  PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues."DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) is a joint USAF/USN venture to replace the Services' fleets of primary trainer aircraft (T-37 and T-34, respectively) and associated Ground Based Training Systems (GBTS).  Additionally the US Army purchased four T-6 Army Variant aircraft to replace the T-34 aircraft for the Army Test and Evaluation Command.  The USAF/USN T-6 aircraft and GBTS are used to train entry-level student aviators in the fundamentals of flying so they can transition into advanced training tracks leading to qualification as military pilots, combat systems officers, and naval flight officers.  The program includes the purchase of aircraft, simulators, and other associated ground-based training devices, Training Integration Management System (TIMS), instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and development activities related to DMSMS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38 is a twin engine, two seat (tandem), supersonic jet trainer used by Air Education and Training Command as an advanced trainer in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training.  Modifications are budgeted to enhance operational capability while improving flight safety, reliability and maintainability.  There are currently 505 T-38's in the Air Force inventory (53 T-38A, 6 AT-38B and 446 T-38C) with 5 T-38Cs pending removal.  T-38s first entered service in 1961 and average over 49 years old.

T-38C Avionics System obsolescence remediation efforts to qualify updated systems will continue from FY2016 through 2018 with development of a replacement Mission Display Processor, refurbishment of the existing Heads-Up Display, development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast solution as well as replacement of the Very High Frequency Communication radio system and the Very High Frequency Navigation radio system. The development and integration of an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast solution will also include the T-38A/B aircraft.
 
Additionally, studies &amp; development efforts to support future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address obsolescence issues and the regular block upgrades are required to keep the system current. These will be accomplished with O&amp;M unless block upgrade provides additional capabilities. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration or National Airspace System and to address flight safety issues.  The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The T-38 Operations System Development acquisition strategy for satisfying emerging software and hardware requirements is designed to enable competition and cost control. Developmental requirements resulting from Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages research and reporting will be evaluated and implemented incrementally to efficiently deliver required capabilities to Air Education &amp; Training Command in support of the pilot training program.  System block upgrades will be required to maintain aircraft airworthiness and will be implemented based on Air Education &amp; Training Command requirements.  An appropriate level of technical data rights is required by all current support contracts.
 
Contract FA8211-16-D-0001 is a Type D Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract competitively awarded to address T-38C avionics system obsolescence issues and provide Contractor Logistics Support follow-on support. The Avionics Component Integration contract was awarded 8 January 2016.  Obsolescence remediation efforts began immediately and the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support effort will begin 1 April 2017.

The T-38A/B Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast program is in the source selection phase.  Projected contract award is June 2017.  The current contract strategy is a Type D Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract sole source awarded to modify APX-119 transponders declared excess by the Item Manager and "free issued" to the T-38 Program Office. As part of the sole source effort, the aircraft integration work will be accomplished.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) consists of two advanced sensor systems, the Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) and Scorpion, incorporated into a single WAS System.  Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS will detect/track low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs will be incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.

In FY2017, Special Program efforts were transferred to PE 0604445F, Wide Area Surveillance, Project 675899, Wide Area Surveillance in order to centrally fund and manage efforts.  

In FY2017, Project 675895, Wide Area Surveillance was terminated.

Some aspects of the WAS program are classified and will be provided on a need-to-know basis.  Contact Major Willie Mims (SAF/AQID), 202-404-3331, for additional information.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) consists of two advanced sensor systems, the Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) and Scorpion, incorporated into a single WAS System.  Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS will detect/track low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs will be incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the North American Aerospace Defense Command/ Northern Command (NORAD/NORTHCOM) Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) strategy is a single step acquisition approach for full capability to develop, produce, and field highly capable and sustainable advanced sensors in the National Capital Region. Science &amp; technology contracts were let prior to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase for both sub-systems. The ongoing Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) was awarded to a single developer to design, build, integrate, and test the STARS system. A subsequent task order will be awarded (May 17) to include pre-operational site support. The ongoing CPFF contract for Scorpion was awarded to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and testing of the Scorpion system, and conduct pre-operational site support. The pre-operational site support for both the STARS and Scorpion contracts will transition to Interim Contract Support (ICS) in FY2018.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to accomplish this goal by modernizing existing technology, resulting in a secure and authoritative data environment that improves accuracy, strengthens decision making and reduces processing time and costs.  AFIPPS supports effective military personnel management and development throughout the lifecycle of all military members, by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data.  AFIPPS will enable accurate and timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances and benefits and make appropriate information available for all levels of management.Active(RegAF), National Guard(ANG),and Reserve(AFRes)components will integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflects the core requirements of the Combatant Commands, the Department of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies.

AFIPPS's customers include approximately 510,000 AF service members across all components (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes) as well as thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield.  Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFIPPS acquisition strategy focuses on expanding the fielded AF personnel system (MilPDS) by integrating a pay capability. MilPDS is implemented using the commercial Oracle ERP E-Business Suite (EBS). The AFIPPS strategy will be to configure/develop the pay portion of EBS, ensure the system is fully integrated, and deployed. The Government will award a contract for the pay system development, test, and deployment. The development activities will be fully coordinated and integrated with the on-going operation and sustainment of MilPDS.

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Anti-Tamper  (AT) Technology Executive Agency budget funds activities related to two AT responsibilities required by DoDD 5200.47E Anti-Tamper. These responsibilities include areas unique to the DoD Executive Agent for Anti-Tamper (ATEA) and Air Force Component AT Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The ATEA is responsible for developing and implementing AT policy, coordinating and providing financial support for AT technology development and evaluations, hardware/software vulnerability assessments, laboratory infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a data bank/library of AT technologies, providing security mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, and funding validation and evaluations of AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs. The AF AT OPR, that is also funded by this PE and is responsible for the oversight and security of AT on all AF acquisition programs under the Program Protection Planning process and  manages AF AT technology development. 

The DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry.

AT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters’ mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. 

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with resident critical program information (RCPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

The DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, and other AT enablers. 

The Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.
This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DoD ATEA acquisition strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology developments across the Services which fund coordination and assessments of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts by increasing TRL. The ATEA will coordinate the Technology Roadmap with major Prime vendors. Evaluating their AT CRADA projects is of major importance. The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs, Services are developing for their AT implementation. Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with reduced power needs and smaller form factor. The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point they can be transitioned to a program office or    industry for implementation in our weapon systems. Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

The Air Force AT Office in 2017, will fund and manage new technology efforts to protect Air Force critical program information.  These new  AT technology requirements will be obtained from AF programs and these new AT technologies will then transition to Air Force programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0605278F, project 675006, HC/MC-130 Block 8.X, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization will replace and augment the aging USAF fleets of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/P/H aircraft which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability and operational limitations.

This program will develop and integrate changes from discrepancies found during development and operational flight test, and common C-130J block upgrades during HC/MC production.  The HC/MC Block 8.1 program follows the same "Block Upgrade" strategy being used in the C-130J program (PE 0401132F).

The internationally developed Block 8.1 program addresses mandated Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  It also incorporates capabilities such as Link 16, a new Flight Management System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation, Identification Friend or FOE (IFF) transponder Mode-5, Civil Data-link,  and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out).

The HC/MC Block 8.1 RDT&amp;E effort integrates Block 8.1 into a HC-130J and a MC-130J via a trial kit install effort followed by a Development and Operational Test effort.  

The USAF will be fielding the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates.

The Block 8.1 fleet modification program begins in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO) is an Air Force Core Function. Within this core function, Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) is the exercise of authority and direction by the President, as Commander in Chief, through established command lines, over nuclear weapon operations of military forces. The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. These functions are accomplished through the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) system of systems.

The NC3 system of systems provides connectivity from the President or Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces worldwide. To enhance NC3 mission success, the AF formalized AF NC3 elements as a specified AF Weapon System (WS).  Activities funded in this PE integrate legacy systems, ongoing NC3 programs, and future capabilities for the overall AF NC3 WS.  

The AF Nuclear Weapon Center NC3 Integration Directorate (AFNWC/NC) will ensure current, new, and future NC3 capabilities are fully integrated as part of the Air Force's overall effort to sustain, modernize, and recapitalize the nuclear enterprise.  AFNWC/NC will be responsible for integrating NC3 materiel management across Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to include authority and responsibility for weapon system architecture, weapon system configuration management, overall integration, system test, verification, and certification.  AFNWC/NC is responsible for defining, building, and sustaining current and future NC3 WS system of systems configuration baselines, and marshaling necessary Supporting Centers in AFMC and other units/agencies in the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD) to support and/or accomplish these tasks.  AFNWC/NC will collaborate with AFMC Supporting Centers to champion the full spectrum of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) efforts, in support of Air Force Global Strike Command as the Lead Command championing NDO requirements for all Combatant Commands. 

This program funds activities for integrating AF NC3 WS materiel, authority, and responsibility for the AF NC3 WS architecture, configuration management, and overall AF NC3 WS integration, system test, verification, and certification.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 System Improvements - A comprehensive project to ensure B-52 viability to perform current and future wartime missions. To facilitate future capabilities, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other analysis or paper work necessary to establish a program of record.  Additionally, this project may lead to airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies.

Cost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.

B-52 System Improvements will encompass the following major aircraft areas but is not limited to the examples given within each area.

Avionics - Offensive and Defensive; Electronic Warfare systems require upgrades to continue to protect the aircraft in the battle space. Radar Modernization is required to ensure the aircraft can perform the mission in today's environment and resolve current mean time between repair issues with legacy radar.  Global Positioning Satellite Interface Unit (GPS-IU) requires replacement due to throughput issues. 

B-52 Airspace Compliance - Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades are required to comply with increasing FAA requirements. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrade to meet FAA mandate for FY20. GPS guidance unit requires upgrade to new military M-Code standard.

Situational Awareness (SA) - upgrades to current SA systems is required to ensure the B-52 maintains battle space awareness of intelligence broadcasts, friendly force locations, enemy forces and any emerging threats within the Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Adaptation of new data links as well as addition of existing links is crucial to the B-52 remaining relevant to the integrated airborne battle space.

Weapons/Targeting Pod Integration - Improves conventional warfare capability with additional MIL-STD-1760 smart weapons and improved weapons carriage and fully integrates advanced targeting pods with the offensive avionics system. Integrate emerging targeting pods to include optical and radar targeting capabilities.  

Communications - current UHF communications systems require upgrades due to legacy radios and satellite systems rearing end of life.  Multiple User Objective System (MUOS) satellite deployments will require the B-52 to upgrade legacy UHF radios to remain relevant.  New technology Beyond line of Sight (BLOS) and Line of Sight (LOS) radios are emerging and required on the B-52 to ensure communications continue in the AOR.  Extreme High Frequency (EHF) program required to meet Nuclear Command Authority two way communications.

Flight Systems - current Jet A fuel used freezes at higher temperatures than previous fuel and therefore requires the addition of an internal fuel tank monitoring system to ensure the fuel does not gel and freeze while flying at altitude. In additiona, the B-52 requires a new Environmental Control System (ECS) upgrade to support any new major aircraft modifications. EHF studies have indicated this will be a needed modification for integration depending on the terminal selection.

Nuclear Systems - studies, analyzes, and tests aircraft systems' hardness to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons effects, such as Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) and High altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Survivability tests.  It upgrades mission critical systems to survive in CBRN environments.

Electronic Flight Bags - require a system for displaying aircrew checklists on a permanent display.  This supports current AF requirements to reduce carry on paper checklists.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY17 Bomber Tactical Data Link was a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 18 March 2004, captures the requirements for a Tactical Data Link (TDL) capability on the B-52. The B-52 TDL, provides low latency, jam-resistant situation awareness and command and control communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT. This Line-Of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats and employing an array of weapons.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the Link-16 upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security requirements (JRE messaging, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (1760 IWB, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB updates, RMP, Re-Engining, etc) may require study/support for potential impact to the CONECT and Link-16 system. Funds may be used for Engineering Development Models (EDMs), test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MIL-STD-1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU) requires the integration of the 1760 weapons capability into the bomb bay on 78 B-52H aircraft. It includes two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA), utilizing 44 Common Strategic Rotary Launchers (CSRLs) converted into Conventional Rotary Launchers (CRLs), where three of the CRLs will be modified under Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for test purposes. The 1760 IWBU project is segmented into increments.  Increment 1.0 provides internal and external carriage and consists of two sub increments 1.1 and 1.2. This requirement's Capability Development Document (CDD) was validated by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) in June 2013.  The 1760 Capability Production Document was validated by the AFROC in February 2015.  Development efforts for Increment 1.1 were completed in November 2015 and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) May 2016.

Increment 1.2 

Increment 1.2 develops the capability for internal carriage of eight Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and its variants, to include JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and eight Miniature Air Launched Decoys (MALD) and its variants, to include MALD Jammer (MALD-J).  This increment also develops the capability for external carriage for 12 JASSM-ER.  Increment 1.2 completed Preliminary Design Review (PDR) in October 2015.  Critical Design Review (CDR) was conducted in March 2016.  Milestone B approval was granted in April 2016.  An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) was conducted in May 2016, validating cost and schedule baselines.

Upon completion of JASSM/ER software development, an interim capability providing for carriage and deployment of no less than 20 JASSM/ER (8 bay (power 4), 12 external) is planned.  A combined DT/OT will validate this capability in advance of 1.2 Full System validation.   

Aircraft Hardware Development:  Development of Group A wiring and circuit breakers to supply additional power to the CRL per JASSM-ER requirements, for all 76 operational B-52H aircraft, and two Ground Instructional Training Aircraft. 

Software Development: Development of a modification to existing aircraft SMO and weapon (JASSM and MALD) OFP software to allow for internal and external carriage and modification to ground based JMPS.

CRL Hardware Development: Develops Group A associated interface hardware and two Group B LRUs (power supply and power distribution box).  One CRL will be modified for Interim and three CRLs will be modified for 1.2 Full using RDT&amp;E funds.

Support Equipment:  Consists of developing software updates to the existing MUSTANG to interface with the CRL and the development of additional ground handling support equipment.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade project will acquire software development and hardware design via a sole-source contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS), Oklahoma City, OK. Deliverables include an updated J-series weapon SMOs (software), three prototype modified CSRLs, six Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) assets, logistics support, ground and flight test support, and engineering drawings.  The Increment 1.1 program procured the CRL modification kits via sole source to Boeing DSS, OKC for LRIP and Full Rate Production (FRP), LRIP Installations, and FRP Installs of the kits will be completed via Contract Field Teams (CFTs).  


Increment 1.2 Program has a sole-source Engineering Manufacturing and Development contract to Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (DSS), Oklahoma City, OK.  Upon completion of JASSM/ER OFP and SMO software coding, an interim capability of no less than 20 JASSM/ER (8 bay(power 4), 12 external) will be vaildated thru DT/OT in FY17.   The Increment 1.2 program plans to procure the CRL modification and aircraft kits for full rate production via sole source, and this was approved at a Delta Acquisition Strategy, October 2016. The installs of the kits are planned to be completed via CFTs and PDM (10 installations through PDM).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52 fleet with tactical datalink and voice communications capabilities, along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. 

The CONECT upgrade includes new Multi-Functional Color Displays (MFCDs); a digital interphone system, on-board client/server architecture supporting distributed processing with independent control functions;  Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) Joint Range Extension (JRE) capability Intelligence Broadcast Receiver (IBR); limited Internet Protocol (IP)-based UHF BLOS link supporting voice, e-mail and file transfers; and Improved Data Modem (IDM)-based digital Variable Message Format (VMF) datalink. As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF),etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT.

In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers, using stimulate/simulate/computer-based training or a mix, to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the system integration laboratory (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale and Minot units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Positioning System (GPS) Interface Unit (IU) Upgrade will replace three Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) in the GPS IU, as well as the backplane (to integrate the new and old CCAs):  the Central Processing Unit/1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics card.  The current inventory of GPS IUs (76 installed on B-52H, plus current supply level of 16), plus 1 in the System Integration Laboratory (SIL), and 2 on Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA)) will be upgraded by Prime Contractor Boeing.  The upgraded LRUs will be replaced using blue-suit installation, using remove-and-replace processes on the flight line (the current maintenance process).

The GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems onboard the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.

Originally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, it is projected to exceed the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load by 2018.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2018.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.

GPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.


This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY17 Radar Modernization Program was a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading or replacing, in whole or in part, the current APQ-166 radar Line Replaceable Units on the B-52H aircraft. The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, off-the-shelf components and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, all the applicable training devices which process radar data or represent the radar subsystem must also be modified and upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT), and the Bombing-Navigation System Maintenance Trainers (BNSMT). The program will retire the five existing BNMSTs and replace them with three new virtual training devices.

As the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, crew vehicle interfaces), as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to RMP. 
 
Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. 

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

Continuing work related to the Mission Data Recorder to make the T-1 modification a Permanent Modification to the platform. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY17 B-52 Weapons Systems Trainer Air Refueling Training Upgrade was a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The principal mission of the B-52 Training Systems program is to ensure high fidelity simulators and training systems are available for aircrew members to support credible training, maintain proficiencies, and increase skill levels. B-52 Aircrew Training Devices simulates the necessary visual, motion, and audible cues to provide ground training of Air Force Global Strike Command aircrew members. The B-52 Weapon System Trainer (WST) Air Refueling Upgrade is a comprehensive project that will allow B-52 Aircrew to accomplish credible air refueling training in the simulator, which minimizes the requirement for on-aircraft air refueling training. To facilitate this capability, scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA),Studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other Analysis or paperwork necessary to establish a program of record. 
 
Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

DMSMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds will address emergency warfighting readiness requirements.  Funds will facilitate future capabilities by conducting B-52 modernization and sustainment risk reduction studies such as, but not limited to, studies on new engines, electrical, pneumatic, cart-start, wing flutter analysis, TF-33 (present engine) refurbishment (SLEP).  It also includes program management support for the development and integration of future capabilities.  To facilitate future capabilities, the scope of work may involve development of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), studies and Analysis, Capability Development Documents (CDD) or any other analysis or paper work necessary to establish a program or record. 

Cost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 Weapon System.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Upgrades aircraft with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capable ARC-210 radio systems to prevent loss of BLOS voice and data communications capability. As MUOS legacy channels are turned on, existing satellites will be removed from service.  B-52 CONECT is at risk of losing its File Transfer Protocol (FTP), email, Beyond Line of Site (BLOS) voice, and BLOS data link communications without this modernization effort.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0101113F, project 676039, B-52 Airspace Compliance, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 Airspace Compliance - Communication, Navigation and Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) upgrades are required to comply with increasing FAA requirements.  Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) upgrades to meet FAA mandate for FY20.  Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance unit requires upgrade to new military M-Code standard.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W-80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy’s territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage. 

RDT&amp;E funds are used to develop new tests and evaluation procedures, software, and equipment, and provide sustainment solutions for Line Replaceable Units (LRU) to ensure ALCM sustainability supports Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and Global Strike mission requirements through 2030.

The ALCM Test Plan Development and Evaluation program develops plans and procedures for testing nuclear systems, and implements those procedures as directed by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and to satisfy the recurring requirements to test Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) susceptibility.

In FY17 Global Positioning System (GPS) Military-Code (M-Code) was a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range, conventional bomber.  It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the United States Air Force inventory.  The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision and non-precision weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time. The current service life extends beyond 2040.

The B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing. 

FULLY INTEGRATED TARGETING POD (FITP)
Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) Modification permanently integrates the advanced targeting pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B’s avionics flight software and replaces the B-1B’s Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS)/Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with increased situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance within the Combat Air Forces (CAF).  FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed &amp; throughput for aircrew mission planning, a permanent sustainment support structure.  It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital high definition quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS) multi-function displays (MFDs) and cursor controller.  FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets with improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities.  In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use.  Furthermore, the Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) removes the need for Interim Contractor Support (ICS) sustainment support structure, resolving DMS issue.

MODE 5/S AUTOMATIC SURVEILLANCE BROADCAST (ADS-B) OUT
B-1 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 is the replacement for the B-1 Mark XII IFF Mode 4. Mode 5 will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for Combat Identification. Mode Select (Mode S) and ADS-B Out provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for Air Traffic Control, Air Defense System and/or aircraft. The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid loss of B-1 aircraft through fratricide. Upgrades to ADS-B Out and Mode S are required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates to field by January 2020 and upgrade to Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) mandate to field by September 2020. Failure to meet mandates will result in delayed/denied service within controlled airspace in the United States and Europe. Funds are included to accommodate the FAA mandate for ADS-B and Mode S and JROC mandate
for Mode 5 as outlined throughout previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

RADIO CRYPTO COMPLIANCE
The B-1 Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by 1 Jan 2020. If the requirements are not met, B-1 is at risk of losing secure line of sight and beyond line of sight communication (BLOS) with ground and air forces. Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1 will not be able to participate in CONUS/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with Crypto Compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate DoD mandate as outlined throughout previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) – Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)
The B-1 Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) – Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) replaces the existing MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) 1 Link 16 terminal to meet National Security Agency (NSA) Crypto Modernization (CM) Device Cease Key and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Frequency Remap mandates; systems become non-compliant in 2025.  MIDS-JTRS resolves all LVT 1 deficiencies and adds substantial combat capability enhancements to Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (LET) and Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN-4) with Concurrent Retention Receive (CRR).  MIDS-JTRS also provides multi-datalink capability, improving situational awareness and allows rapid inflight retargeting in cooperative combat environment.  Funds are included to accommodate DoT/DoD approved Frequency Remap and Crypto Modernization Device Cease Key mandates as outlined throughout previous Air Force (AF) and Department of Defense (DoD) budget exhibits.

Bomb Rack Unit (BRU) 56 
Bomb Rack Unit (BRU) 56 will solve a safety risk with the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use resulted in a deficiency with the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency caused failure in one 2003 Class A mishap, one 2010 Class C mishap and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification avoids future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.

Global Positioning System (GPS) Military-Code (M-Code)
This project will integrate a  military GPS receiver delivering improved capabilities to allow for accurate and reliable positioning, navigation, and timing for B-1 primary flight instrumentation, navigation, radar, weapon, and communication systems where current receiver performance might be compromised or unavailable.  M-Code has a higher-power signal offering better resistance to jamming and interference; advanced security features to prevent unauthorized access or exploitation by adversaries; and improved message formats and signal modulation techniques for faster and more accurate performance.

INTEGRATED BATTLE STATION (IBS) SIMULATOR DEVELOPMENT
B-1B training systems upgrades (both flight and maintenance simulators/trainers) provide required training assets for the aircraft Central Integrated Test System(CITS),Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL), and Vertical Situational Display Upgrade (VSDU) modernization projects. These upgrades are required to bring the simulators up to the same configuration of the modernized aircraft. The B-1B training system provides the warfighter with a fully integrated, cost effective, high fidelity training capability in flight operations, weapons employment, and maintenance of the B-1B weapon system.

FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT UPGRADES
Upgrades to the B-1B flight test aircraft are included in the modernization projects to keep the test flight systems current. RDT&amp;E funded test jets are currently configured with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) for CITS, FIDL and VSDU. Replacement of the EMD LRUs is required to bring two flight test aircraft to fleet representative configuration. Maintenance and logistic support from the manufacturer is required until the Air Force supply chain is established. Replacement of the LRUs will ensure maximum supportability, maintainability, and reliability for continued and future flight tests.

GAP &amp; INTEGRATION ANALYSIS
Additionally, program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet fielded. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing source issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Cost includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, including efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total ownership cost. All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases.

Funding is also required to ensure test asset availability for testing of aircraft RDT&amp;E efforts.  This Program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-1B weapon system capability.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Bomb Rack Unit (BRU)56 will solve a safety risk with the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability.  Prolonged use resulted in a deficiency with the rivets within the linkage of the rack.  This caused failure in one 2003 Class A mishap, one 2010 Class C mishap and multiple ground mishaps.   The BRU-56 modification avoids the bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 IFF Mode 5/S/ADS-B out, is a new start.
This program, BA 07 PE 0101127F, project 675345, B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU), is a new start.

In FY 2017 and subsequent the B-2 AEHF strategic communications effort is documented in Project 676022 AEHF Strategic Comm; in FY 2016 $10.926M for the effort is documented in Project 675345 B-2 Modernization.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 Spirit is the world's most advanced long-range strike asset. The unique combination of range, precision, payload, and ability to penetrate and operate in anti-access/area denial environments allow the B-2 to identify, locate, target, and destroy the highest value enemy targets. The B-2 can, with necessary upgrades, accomplish its mission regardless of location, return to base safely, and permit freedom of movement for follow-on forces, including other long range strike platforms. An array of planned RDT&amp;E projects are necessary to preserve a strategic advantage against 21st century threats as well as increase flexibility, lethality, and survivability of this national asset tasked across a broad spectrum of tactical and national strategic objectives. B-2 will achieve these objectives by adapting mature technologies/systems in the fleet to rapidly deliver relevant combat capability, leveraging other Department of Defense investments and programs, utilizing innovative acquisition strategies.

The B-2 has a projected service life through 2058. To ensure the fleet can accomplish its nuclear and conventional mission in highly defended and anti-access environments, periodic modernization efforts must be undertaken to upgrade combat capability as well as improve the viability, supportability, and survivability of the weapon system.

Recent and ongoing investments in avionics, structures, communications, and weapons keep the B-2 viable in the immediate future. Current system upgrades include Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications, Defensive Management System Modernization, Flexible Strike Phase 1, alternative communication solutions such as Common Very Low Frequency Receiver and B-2 AEHF (Strategic Communications), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon integration, Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) and Global Positioning System enhancements. The B-2 is also exploring opportunities for architecture updates to reduce future integration costs and improve program affordability. The Defensive Management System effort is documented in the exhibit for PE 0605931F.
In addition to the B-2 improvements described above, the Air Force has continuing efforts for Training Systems, Mission Planning System improvements, flight test aircraft upgrades and base of operations support, integration and testing of upgraded cryptographic components, as well as B-2 platform studies and acquisition planning.
 
Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, and support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance man-hours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low density fleet.

Modern communications are key enablers for the B-2 in the anti-access/area denial battlespace, and directly enhance lethality and force multiplication. The Common Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver effort (CVR) develops and integrates a receive-only, low bandwidth receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-2. The receiver will be adaptable for use by other Department of Defense platforms. B-2 cryptographic modernization updates cryptographic equipment for B-2 AIT/ARC-234, AN/ARC-211 and MIDS/LVT communication systems. The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) explores incremental improvements to the B-2 ACS UHF communication system. The B-2 Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system provides secure, strategic, two-way, survivable Anti-Access/Area Denial communications capability for conventional and nuclear missions. The effort was established in Project 675345 B-2 Modernization; the B-2 AEHF effort continues in FY 2017 and subsequent years under Project 676022 AEHF Strategic Comm.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. The Flexible Strike Phase 1 program will re-host the current B-2 stores management software onto a new integrated processor. B-2 will also integrate the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon to further enhance the B-2's ability to attack and destroy high value target sets.

The Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) program supports the B-2 ability to penetrate anti-access combat environments, performing missions directed by the National Command Authority while ensuring aircrew survivability. The LOSSM program reduces low observable (LO) maintenance, and stabilizes and improves the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet. This program encompasses multiple improvement projects including, but not limited to, improved LO materials (electrically conductive materials, adhesives, electrically resistive materials, radar absorbing material, fastener fills, coatings, welds, material removal tools, and improved processes), LO structures (radar radomes, antennas, hot trailing edges and tiles, intermediate section doors, tailpipes, windows, lib bay panels, leading edge, permanent fasteners, exhaust pockets, gust load alleviation system, inlets, radar absorbing structures, overall signature stability, and Alternate High Frequency Material expansion), and radio frequency (RF) diagnostic tools, evaluation systems, and other tools (Tier One Material Inspection System, Signature Diagnostic System, next generation Tier II and Tier III systems, Test Article 0998 optimization, conductivity probes, tailpipe inspection tools, LO-related special test equipment, data archival, and communications tools).

The B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) provides a more capable recorder for flight data recovery following a mishap. The initiative includes replacement of the current CSMU and reprogramming firmware of the Flight Data Recorder Processor (FDRP) which provides data streams to the recorder. The current CSMU/FDRP does not meet the minimum requirements specified in the Aircraft Information Program (AIP) reference documents (AFI 63-133 and AFH 63-1402).

The B-2 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S modification provides improved combat identification security with better discrimination between closely spaced platforms, while reducing interference with civil air traffic control transponders enabling the B-2 fleet to accomplish its anti-access and global strike mission. Mode S provides improved accuracy, altitude resolution and reduced interference from closely spaced aircraft through interrogation of assigned transponder addresses.

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification. Upgrades may include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Additional Training System Upgrades may also include efforts to implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Baseline Support maintains and upgrades the B-2 unique flight test aircraft as well as hardware/software and test equipment to support developmental systems integration, and flight test, reducing the need for additional operational aircraft and accelerating deployment of advanced operational capabilities to the warfighter. Baseline Support also ensures the Mission Planning System keeps pace with aircraft modifications and improves the mission planning core system. Baseline Support provides for other B-2 unique government costs and includes assorted studies of aircraft performance and cost trades as well as acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future aircraft, engine, weapon, communication, navigation or other capabilities.
Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system provides the only survivable, low probability of intercept/detection, high bandwidth system that ensures secure intra/inter-flight and two-way command and control communications in the modern anti-access/aerial denial battlespace. This communications upgrade replaces the Milstar/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM system (which is nearing system end of life) on the B-2. 
The strategic communications effort will select, install, and integrate the radio, antenna and system components required to provide two-way EHF communication for the B-2.
Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MM Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue MM III operations through 2030.  These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD.  Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R), LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Phase II (FRPB II), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II), 

MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities and conduct of MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS)and LGM-30G Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR).  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.  

MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment. Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G Alignment Set Test Set (ASTS), LGM-30G Control Monitor Procedure Trainer Upgrade (CMPT), LGM-30G G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), LGM-30G Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), and LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP). As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  

MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in the LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformations mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2.  As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.

These efforts also includes any needed nuclear surety and certification and system vulnerability assessments.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes developmental efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ALCS-R will replace the legacy nuclear command and control system that provides the capability to launch ICBMs from an airborne platform, currently the Navy E-6B. The system consists of a nuclear hardened radio and MM III interface at each LF, and a suite of launch equipment and cryptographic equipment that generates and transmits commands from the E-6B. ALCS-R is dependent on the Strategic Air Command Code Processing System for codes data supplied to airborne equipment, and the Navy E-6B radio Command, Control, and Communication data path to transmit signals to the LFs. The approved acquisition strategy will replace ALCS equipment by 2024 to resolve critical sustainment and cryptographic sunset issues and assure survivable, airborne launch capability for current and future ICBMs. ALCS-R will be designed for Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) airborne survivable launch platform capability maximizing investment across both ICBM weapon systems.</r2:Description>

The ASU is controlled by the MPP, which contains software and electronics to measure incoming and standby power characteristics. The DEU provides standby power in the event of a loss of the primary power source. Current equipment and lack of repair/reprogram capability causes inadvertent source transfers by the MPP. Technical data does not exist for repair or reprogramming of the MPP making it unsupportable. The ASU contacts have exceeded their service life, and unnecessary source transfers stress mission critical components. The increased power transfers have increased the use and accelerated the wear on the DEU.</r2:Description>

The LCCBU program is a single modification effort that replaces five components. Components will be procured as a single modification kit and installed as a single kit at each LCC. It will consist of five primary replacement efforts: 

1) Journal Memory Loader (JML) - replaces the JML with a modern data storage solution which will increase the available memory required to support annual software changes and mitigate Floppy Disk obsolescence concerns.
2) Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) - replaces the legacy FDDs which are no longer manufactured with a modern, supportable hardware solution.
3) Voice Communications Control Panel (VCCP) - replaces the current deficient equipment to provide the voice communications quality required to perform the ICBM mission and may require additional components to resolve voice communication degradations.
4) Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Printer - replaces the current printer that is no longer produced and is unsupportable due to aging hardware and a lack of qualified vendors for replacement/repair components.
5) Oxygen Regeneration Unit (ORU) - replaces the current unsupportable system to provide the crew with breathable air during periods when the LCC is locked down.

All LCCBU efforts will support the 45 operational LCCs and additional support equipment/test/maintenance locations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of newly developed or modified MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3), LGM-30G Ground Test Upgrade (GTU), and LGM-30G Squadron Data Simulator (SDS). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ADSR program (FY18 New Start) designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the aging Arm/Disarm (A/D) switches currently on the MM III Missile fleet.  The A/D switch is responsible for completing or interrupting ordnance electrical circuits.  A/D switches are placed at five key locations in the system: Interstage I-II, Stage II Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control (LITVC) and Roll Control, Interstage II-III, PSRE Staging, and PSRE Isolation Valves.  Aging and surveillance is an ongoing study to generate a tradeoff curve between reliability/availability and cost.  Reliability/availability are monitored by periodic testing to discover unforeseen issues.  Because all existing A/D switches cannot be repaired/refurbished, the number in inventory will eventually be inadequate to meet the need of the PDM cycle.  Supply is estimated to deplete in FY18 without a repair/refurbish mitigation and by approximately FY22 with repair/refurbish mitigation.  Repair/refurbish is a reliable mitigation plan to meet the ongoing needs of the fleet while a manufacturer is selected and the manufacturing system is selected to develop a new, more reliable A/D switch that meets requirements and PDM production quantities. ADSR is required to continue Booster and PSRE PDMs through 2030.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Program was cancelled in FY16.  Cadmium plating is used in the LF and LCC Motor Generators. Motor generator parts are coated with the material to inhibit corrosion, ensure a low electrical signature (bonding and grounding) and aide in the ability to withstand a nuclear environment. Cadmium is one of the EPA-17 chemicals selected for reduction. Executive Directive 13148 and FAR part 23.703 states, "eliminate or reduce the generation of hazardous waste and the need for special material processing." CaDRP will provide a cadmium replacement coating with the same properties for corrosion inhibiting, bonding and grounding, and nuclear event survivability to meet these directives. Process must meet the weapon system parameters for form, fit, function, system safety, and hardness.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>FT3 designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer, associated Signal Conditioner Monitor Group (SCMG), as well as the Integrated Instrumentation System (IIS), Flight Destruct System (FDS) and the Launch Safety System (LSS).  This will replace the unsupportable instrumentation wafer and FDS that do not meet current Range Safety Standards.  The Mod 7 instrumentation wafer transmits missile performance telemetry and position data and receives command destruct messages during MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) and developmental flight test evaluations. The SCMG and associated cabling capture Reentry System performance data during OTLs and developmental flight tests.  FT3 will replace the current MM III OTL flight destruct capability used in the event of a flight anomaly where it would be necessary to destroy the missile.  LSS replaces the current unique, specialized test system at Vandenberg AFB used to monitor and control test launch flights and ground support equipment. The current LSS is over 15-years old and experiencing major supportability issues. LSS failure trends are increasing due to hardware aging and obsolescence creating a need for workarounds, waivers and contractor intervention. A new Instrumentation Wafer and FDS are required to continue OTLs through 2030. A new LSS is required to field the Instrumentation Wafer and the FDS.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment. These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G Alignment Set Test Set (ASTS), LGM-30G Control Monitor Procedure Trainer Upgrade (CMPT), LGM-30G G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (G6B4 BER), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), LGM-30G Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA BER), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), and LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The G6B4 BER program impacts three stations: the G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station, the G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station, and the Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS).  The G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station (S-133-18024) is used to determine radial and dynamic balance of the G6B4 gyro rotor after repair, and it needs to have the obsolete Schenk balancer and console replaced.  Two copies of the G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station will be delivered.  The G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station (S-133-132-4-384) is used to fill the G6B4 with hydrogen gas following repairs, and it needs to have obsolete and failing gauges, plumbing and valves replaced.  The Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS) (S-133-18038) is used to calibrate the F-coefficient of the G6B4 gyro after repairs are complete; it needs its obsolete hydraulic and electrical power systems replaced.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Nuclear Weapon Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2. It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring. These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2018, PE 0101313F, Strategic War Planning System - USSTRATCOM, Project 675029, ISPAN Increment 5 efforts will transfer to PE 0101324F, Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network, Project 675029, ISPAN Increment 5, in order to provide improved transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY17 ISPAN Increment 5 was a new start PE 0101313F.

The mission of the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinate space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, Global Command Control Communications and Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  This mission has been defined by the 2011 Unified Command Plan (UCP) change 1.  To enable completion of these missions, USSTRATCOM is modernizing the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as Strategic War Planning System (SWPS)).

ISPAN is a multi-increment effort designed to incrementally add capability for USSTRATCOM and the National Command Authorities (NCA). The program is currently comprised of four increments (ISPAN Block 1, ISPAN Increment 2, Increment 4, and Increment 5.) Block 1, Increment 2, Increment 4, and FY17 Increment 5 are in PE 0101313F.  FY18-21 Increment 5 are in PE 0101324F.  ISPAN Block 1 modified and delivered capability for both the Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) and the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) components. It achieved Full Deployment in July 2010. ISPAN Increment 2 further developed and provided increased capability for GAP CIE. ISPAN Increment 4 starts the  modernization of MPAS.  ISPAN Increment 5 will complete the modernization.  MPAS modernization will enable USSTRATCOM to revitalize its unique Force Planning mission of developing Joint Staff Level 1 through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements. Force planning has become more complicated due to weapons reductions, increased accuracy requirements and delivery options, changing targeting requirements, shortened timelines for senior leader decision-making, and reduced financial resources to develop and sustain these national planning capabilities. ISPAN will modernize MPAS and allow it to fulfill the requirements for a more timely, flexible, and agile planning capability.  When ISPAN Increment 5 is complete the system will support the warfighter in both deliberate and adaptive planning environments while allowing the National Command Authority (NCA) to employ the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons.  Additionally, studies and analyses will be conducted to identify options for evolving the system as interfacing weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes (particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). 

Global Integrated Sensor Network (GSIN) establishes a unified schema integrating disparate Missile Warning/Missile Defense (MW/MD) data into a single exposed data set providing redundant MW/MD data to facilitate the rapid exchange of information across multiple missions and removes information ambiguity that delays time critical national C2 decision-making processes. GSIN networks together all sensors, from tactical to strategic (including the Nation's most modern and capable assets) taking advantage of their larger numbers, improved algorithms, mobility and forward deployment to provide earlier cross-cueing and expanded decision space when every second counts. GSIN will permit an IP-based User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) to augment voice conferencing and rapidly build a single, unambiguous missile event picture allowing real-time senior collaboration for nuclear C2 and improved senior leader situational awareness (SA) and decision-making.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2018, PE 0101313F, Strategic War Planning System - USSTRATCOM, Project 675059, will be completed. 

The Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) (formerly known as SWPS) is a USSTRATCOM system that must be capable of both deliberate and adaptive planning employing the full spectrum of kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The planning system will continue to evolve as weapon systems are matured, new systems are developed, and the threat changes, particularly in the area of worldwide proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

ISPAN Increment 4 will modernize the Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS), that develops Joint Staff Level I through Level IV nuclear and conventional attack options for national and theater requirements.  Increment 4 will fulfill MPAS requirements by reducing Crisis Action Planning and Time Sensitive Planning timelines, integrating nuclear and conventional kinetic weapon capabilities with non-kinetic effects, providing the capability to integrate planning and analysis capabilities of future Global Strike weapons, updating the MPAS system to provide the ability to train users in significantly less time, and leveraging new technologies to lower sustainment costs.  ISPAN Inc 4 is an evolution of the ISPAN Block 1 baseline system using proven technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Worldwide Joint Strategic Communication efforts include Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems to include the Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), and the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS).  Funding may be used to modernize these, and other, NC3 systems.  Funding may also be used for research, testing, validation, certification, configuration management, and assessment of the Air Force NC3 Weapon System.   

SACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system. SACCS provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), Force Status Reporting (FSR), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM. SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.   

SACCS has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01). In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, and ensure the system remains secure against modern/future threats, the Air Force is developing a replacement system.

This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY18 funding was increased $88.942M based on market research and industry engagement.  The Air Force confirmed the UH-1N Replacement program will require non-developmental item (NDI) integration onto an airworthiness-certified helicopter to meet requirements.  The exact scope of NDI integration varies based on the potential offerors' platforms. However, this effort will involve one-time non-reoccurring engineering (NRE) activities to complete NDI integration of mature technologies and associated testing and certifications.  FY18 will also incrementally fund the procurement of four developmental helicopters and support the integration of UH-1N Replacement operational mission planning and aircrew training systems associated with the aircraft solution. A Developmental Test (DT) effort will be necessary to validate the successful NDI integration and demonstrate performance of new capabilities. Operational Testing (OT) will be necessary to validate the solution's operational performance, effectiveness, and suitability. The DT/OT programs will be integrated to maximum extent possible for schedule efficiency. The Air Force also believes live fire test and evaluation activities will be necessary to assess compliance with the force protection and survivability requirements.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The UH-1N Replacement program will replace the Air Force fleet of UH-1N aircraft with modern helicopters that will close significant mission capability gaps associated with the current fleet of UH-1N aircraft.  The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of five Air Force major commands and operating agencies:  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington, Air Education and Training Command, Pacific Air Forces, and Air Force Materiel Command.  AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor.  This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes integration efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

In 2017 UH-1N Replacement 3600 funding was a new start.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Regional/Sector Operation Center Modification program supports the NORAD/NORTHCOM homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is the effort to implement the bi-national program with Canada. The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. 

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM–FIXED MODIFICATION ONE (BCS-F Modification 1). BCS-F Modification 1 effort will implement Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF) into the BCS-F system.  ADS-B provides the BCS-F system the capability to ingest Global Position System (GPS) based location data at the Air Defense Sectors from ADS-B equipped aircraft.  Implementation of ADS-B on aircraft flying in US airspace is mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2020. ECEF is a three-dimensional earth model that eliminates artificial boundaries in the two-dimensional BCS-F stereographic plane. ECEF also allows the ingestion and processing of sensor, target, track, and graphical data without compromising data accuracy due to translation errors.  The BCS-F Modification 1 effort will be executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and Canada.  

In FY17, BCS-F Modification 1 was a new start. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: The Program Management Office (PMO) will pursue full and open competition for BCS Modification 1 efforts.  The BCS-F PMO is finalizing a Project Arrangement (PA) to become a cooperative program with Canada for the ADS-B and ECEF efforts.  These two efforts are anticipated to be awarded concurrently for development in a single release to the Air Defense Sectors.

Management Strategy: Efforts supporting ADS-B and ECEF will be managed by BCS-F PMO in conjunction with Canada PMO and are under the purview of the Air Force Program Executive Officer for Battle Management (AFPEO BM).  Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority.

Contracting Strategy: The BCS-F PMO will utilize full and open competition with a small business set-aside where viable to complete the development and integration of ADS-B and ECEF capabilities.  Cost Plus contract with some Fixed Price CLINS will be utilized where possible and appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.

In FY17, MQ-9 Upgrade, was a new start.

In FY18 the MQ-9 Reaper system has three separate development programs. This PE includes:

1. MQ-9 Development and Fielding. This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators and support equipment.

2. Squadron Operations Centers (SOC). This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers to provide mission data and tasking information to the aircrew and disseminate and/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.

3. MQ-9 Upgrade. This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, ground control station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed on specific aircraft and control station configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).

The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including but not limited to: increasing the maximum gross takeoff weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales(FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL-STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); software updates needed to support new configurations and development; integrating additional precision weapons; hardware and software upgrades to the ground control station.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons). Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to: perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status. It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within LOS range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements.

This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MQ-9 Reaper system will be acquired via sole-source contracts with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI), L3Comm, and Raytheon as the prime contractors.  GA-ASI is the prime contractor for aircraft and ground control stations. GA-MS is the prime contractor for Lynx SAR. L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link. Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO/IR sensor system. Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release). This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SOC is required to employ Remote Split Operations (RSO). It provides the communications, network, aircraft control and sensor distribution circuits to effectively execute RSO missions. The SOC provides CONUS-based aircrews mission data, tasking, and ability to disseminate and exchange mission data with decision-makers and intelligence entities. This effort will develop standardized configurations and interfaces, define component standards and develop and stand up a SOC Systems Integration Lab (SIL). This is a FY18 NEW START.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Since 2004, MQ-1/MQ-9 squadrons have acquired equipment, on an ad hoc basis, to provide the communications, network, aircraft control and sensor distribution circuits needed to execute Remote Split Operations (RSO) missions.  OPAF funding will be used to standardize and modernize existing RPA SOC capability, which is required to reduce security vulnerabilities, as well as address end of life/end of support issues of existing RPA SOC equipment. The Systems Integration Lab will be used to further enhance the program's ability to update future RPA-SOC modernization efforts.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Beginning in FY18, Air Force is centrally managing acquisition for SOC within AFLCMC/WII.  As part of that effort, this year will include the development of new capabilities and future upgrades for the SOC.  AFLCMC/WII will manage the SOC Program for ACC, AFSOC, and ANG through organic development, and hardware/software procurement using Air Force and GSA contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Please refer to the Performance Base Budget Overview Book for information on how Air Force resources are applied and how those resources are contributing to Air Force performance goals and most importantly, how they contribute to our mission.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

This program, BA 07 PE 0205219F, project 675249, MQ-9 Upgrade - Urgent Services, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY17, the MQ-9 Upgrade Program was a new start.

The MQ-9 Upgrade Program will develop improvements for existing systems and field new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy. The objective is to enable fielding of new hardware and/or software for integration into the MQ-9 fleet on an 18-month schedule. The first two releases are under the auspices of the baseline MQ-9 Development and Fielding program. Candidate Release 3 and 4 upgrades include, but are not limited to, implementing an Autonomous Systems upgrade, upgrading the data links to use the new Bandwidth Efficient Common Data Link (BE-CDL), enhancing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and AGM-114 HELLFIRE targeting and employment, integration of new weapons such as Guided Bomb Unit (GBU)-54, and Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) implementing the results of the Technology Insertion program, and software updates needed to support new configurations and development. Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, and safety issues. Activities also include trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>MQ-9 Upgrade - Release 3 and Release 4</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Develop upgrade capabilities to support Releases 3 and 4 of the Hybrid Acquisition Strategy. Development will combine the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Release). New capabilities will include upgrades of existing aircraft, GCS, communication, payload systems, and software updates needed to support new configurations and development as well as the addition of new capabilities and subsystems. 
Final lists of upgrades included in each release will be determined as part of future Executive Oversight Council direction and inputs from JUONs and UON requests. Formal approval of Release 3 content will be established in FY 2018 and is currently subject to fluctuation pending customer priorities. Some current candidates for Release 3 include, but not limited to: 
• Tech Insertion integration
• AGM-114 HELLFIRE enhancements
• JAGM Integration
• GBU-54
• Auto Take-off and Landing Capability (ATLC)
• Software Development to support new capabilities

Acquisition of MQ-9 upgrades will initially be accomplished via sole-source contracts with General Atomics-ASI and L-3 Communications, the prime contractors.  Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through a Hybrid Acquisition Strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process (referred to as a Hybrid Release).  This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Overall this program element(PE) funds on-going sustainment, maintenance, and upgrades of Multi-Platform Electronic Attack (EA) jamming pods and associated combat test equipment as well as sustainment of various other Electronic Warfare equipment. Specifically, this program provides procurement, research, and development, and operations and maintenance for sustaining the ALQ-131 and ALQ-184 EA jamming pods. These pods are the sole self-protection jamming systems for the US Air Force A-10 aircraft and most models of the F-16 aircraft. This upgrade to the EA pod is necessary to keep pace with adversary technological advances in surface-to-air and air-to-air missile systems. Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) allows an electronic system to digitally record and store characteristics of received signals in order to produce a jamming pulse that more precisely replicated the threat system's pulse. The PE is in Budget Activity 7 - Operational System Development because it supports upgrade development of the A-10 and F-16 pods which are fielded systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207131F, project 674809, ADS-B Out, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The A-10 is a twin engine, single seat weapon system capable of delivering a full range of air-to-ground munitions and self-defense air-to-air missiles. The A-10 is an essential capability for successful joint air operations and represents a crucial component of the Combat Air Forces. The A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system to conduct close air support (CAS), combat search and rescue and special operations missions. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous and varied enemy threats.  Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA and other mandates to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness within the provisions of 10 USC 2244A.

Operational Flight Program (OFP) development addresses evolving and continuing user requirements that must be incorporated in the aircraft software in order to employ advanced weapons, increase situational awareness and enhance targeting capabilities as they become available. The funds budgeted continue regular OFP suite development efforts.

Additionally, these OFP funds provide for updates and incorporation of capabilities for weapons integration, targeting pod updates, and  communication/navigation/data link improvements (e.g., M-Code, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) communication system, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Anti-Jam Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (Embedded GPS/ INS) and cyber security upgrades).  These funds will ensure concurrency with systems impacted by OFP development, including but not limited to the Full Mission Trainer (FMT), mission planning and support equipment, as well as required upgrades to the Software Integration Laboratory (SIL). 

FMT's DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Scope will be reduced from Suite 9 due to the FY17 mark/cut but schedule should remain steady contingent upon receiving FY18 in a timely manner. Without receiving FY18 funding when requested it will cause a day for day slip to Suite 9 due to funds needed for flight testing.

Suite 10 has been put on indefinite hold due to $10M mark/cut budget ($14.853 reduced to $4.850) of FY17 RDT&amp;E funding. Suite 10 activities will resume as soon as full FY18 funding becomes available. The estimated release date for Suite 10 is based upon receiving FY18 funds when requested. If FY18 funds are not available when requested, Suite 10 will continue to slip day for day.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-16 weapon system capability.

The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier fixed-wing, high performance, single engine multi-mission fighter aircraft that comprises 50% of the AF fighter inventory.  Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats.  

The modification programs are separated as fleet wide, Pre-Block (25/30/32) or Post-Block (40/42/50/52). Modification programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development on Post-Block OFPs required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet DoD mandates and keep the F-16, the respective training simulators, and other hardware subsystems current; Legacy Post-Block Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which is a two-phased RDT&amp;E effort, includes a Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support structural modifications to increase Certified Service Life (CSL) from 8,000 Equivalent Flight Hours (EFH) to 10,000 EFH (Threshold), or 12,000 EFH (Objective); EMD Hardware/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC)Upgrade/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in Post-Block mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability addresses cyber-security and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 Post-Block aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio upgrade with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability on F-16 Post-Block aircraft to meet next-gen tactical narrowband SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar capable on all blocks that offers advanced electronic protection capabilities as well as improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft that perform the aerospace alert control mission; Hybrid Flight Control Computer (HFLCC) Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS)  development and integration prevents most controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents using terrain database and prediction algorithms for aircraft trajectory recovery and executes an automated fly up maneuver to avoid collision; Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) Out on F-16 Pre-Block aircraft provides improved altitude, airspeed and location info to ground stations and other equipped aircraft in vicinity; Digital Radar Warning Receiver improves on existing radar warning receiver performance and improves Electronic Warfare (EW) threat detection range, azimuth, detection time, and allows reduction of radio frequency compatibility issues with other on board transmitters.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because it includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-16 Program acquisition strategy is to improve capability, maintenance and safety mods through OFP development/flight test, enhanced weapons integration, structural upgrades, and simulator concurrency.

F-16 OFP SW updates will be continually updated on a 3-year cycle to bring new capabilities to the warfighter.  M7+ OFP SW development effort is now completely developed at Hill AFB (309 SMXG).  Numerous Integration contracts (CPFF, FFP) are required to allow for Weapon, ADS-B, MIDS- JTRs integration to successfully field with each OFP. 
 
The Legacy SLEP program uses various contracts supporting Full Scale Durability Test (FSDT) and feeds the EMD effort to develop mod test kits and airworthiness certification recommendation. The prime contractor providing the majority of EMD is Lockheed Martin.  

MMC Upgrade, PDG Upgrade programs have completed source selection. MMC Upgrade awarded to Raytheon on 22 Nov 2016. PDG Upgrade awarded to General Dynamics Mission Systems on 17 Apr 2017.

The EMD HW/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems and uses various contract types (Cost Plus and Fixed Price) 

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)development is currently in negotiations with the prime vendor for a development contract award for the EMD phase.

The new start programs in FY18; Digital Radar Warning Receiver, ADS-B Out Pre-Blocks and Auto-GCAS Pre-Block are all in acquisition development prior to entering source selection.

Flight Test requires both organic test range support and various contract support for integration test of F-16 subsystems to ensure capabilities meet CAF fielding schedule.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today.  The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record.  The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack.  Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready.  A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, upgrades to the F-15 (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability).  Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability.  This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology.  Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR) based fire control system.  The proliferation of fourth generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability.  A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe.  These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15.  Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This includes development of the F-15C and F-15E Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II.  The ADCP II will develop a common mission computer for the F-15C and F-15E.  The current mission computers of both platforms have reached their limits of speed, memory and throughput.  Additionally, digital systems have changed the security requirements of both platforms and the older mission computers cannot be upgraded to meet these new requirements. A common mission computer is expected to reduce future development and long term maintenance costs.  The program will also develop a new F-15C cockpit display to replace an obsolete one. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Cabin Pressure Indicator was approved by Congress as a safety modification and $250K was moved from IRST in FY16 to fund the Cabin Pressure Indicator replacement effort.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These development efforts include F-15 Radar Enhancements Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, Flight Testing, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) and Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Technical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS).  Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

The Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Suite 7C introduces EP into the C/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft will take place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. 

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line allows the Air Force to release software upgrades approximately every 3 years.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. 

Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C/D in a radar-denied environment.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program element funds the development, procurement, and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of HTS Revision 7 (HTS R7) in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to F-35 or a yet to be defined system. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues preplanned product improvements (P3I) for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2013, a separate Program Element (0605213F) was created for Increment 3.2B.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and associated funding prior to FY2013 are included in the F-22A Squadrons (0207138F) budget documentation.

In FY 2015, a separate Project (Budget Program Activity Code [BPAC] 674788) was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates, formerly known as F-22 Mandates.

In FY 2017 HMDCS was a new start

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force; access in the highly contested operational environment; as well as, homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 25+ years.  The F-22 is the only operational multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of F-22 acquisition is complete.  The program is now continuing pre-planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities.  The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, electronic warfare (EW), and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

The FY 2018 funding request increased by $187.937 million as compared to the FY 2017 funding request. This request includes a $95M RMD for the TacLink 16 and Advanced Technology Development, in support of early Sensor Enhancement work. The FY 2018 President's Budget included $50M increase in PE 0207138F for Laboratory Test and Operations (LTO) work associated with technology refresh.  Additionally, there was a $28M increase as TacMan continues its development work and $14M to support ongoing F-22 Small Projects.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207138F, project 674785, F-22 Sensor Enhancements will be a new start in FY 2019.

In FY 2013, a separate Program Element, 0605213F,  was created for Increment 3.2B upon designation as an ACAT I program.  All Increment 3.2B efforts and associated funding prior to FY 2013 are included in the F-22A Squadrons, 0207138F, budget documentation.

In FY 2015, a separate Budget Project Activity Code (BPAC 674788) was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates, formerly known as F-22 Mandates.  

F-22 development and production are complete. The remaining program consists of F-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP) updates, capability enhancements, and mandates necessary to sustain F-22 weapon system survivability, lethality and availability. The "Continuing" Cost to Complete and Total Cost reflect these initiatives.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor represents the USAF's priority placed on providing the Joint Force with air dominance, operational access, and homeland &amp; cruise missile defense for the next 25+ years.  The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines stealth, supercruise, advanced maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable combat aircraft.  While F-22 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and aircraft production completed May 2012, funding for F-22 modernization is "continuing" beyond the FYDP. 

This program funds all non-MDAP development efforts for the F-22.  The program is now continuing the pre-planned and evolutionary modernization effort through incremental development phases that enhance the F-22 anti-access/area denial, Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities.  The development program modernizes and upgrades the air vehicle, engine, avionics, and training systems to improve/enhance F-22 weapons, communications, EW, and ISR capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2015, a separate Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC 674788) within Program Element (PE) 0207138F was created for F-22 Tactical Mandates. Under this BPAC, the F-22 TACLink 16 and F-22 Tactical Mandates (TACMan) programs are managed.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-22 TACLink 16 and F-22 Tactical Mandates programs are follow-on modernization efforts to Increment 3.2B and Update 6. The programs will provide Open Systems Architecture (OSA), Link 16 Transmit and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transpond/Interrogate on the F-22 Block 30/35 combat coded F-22 fleet. 
  
In FY 2017 the budget began to reflect the TACLink 16 program. The F-22  recognized a valuable opportunity to field OSA and Link 16 Transmit earlier than originally planned under the F-22 Tactical Mandates. The Link 16 Transmit enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment.  The TACLink 16 program accelerates the installation of this key data link capability. Additionally, the TACLink 16 will enable future life cycle savings opportunities for the F-22 and  provide risk reduction effort for the F-22 Tactical Mandates program. 

The F-22 Tactical Mandates program will field Mode 5 IFF on the TACLink 16 baseline. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security over the F-22’s legacy Mode 4 capability.  This update is particularly critical given Mode 4 functionality may be unavailable when F-22 Tactical Mandates fields.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Lab Test and Operations (LTO) is a continuous activity that plans and conducts development, integration, test, and verification of F-22 TACMan and TACLink 16 OFPs and hardware.  The LTO provides maintenance, staffing, and operation of 18 development labs including five unique major SILs:  the AIL, RaIL, ACS, VIF, and VSS.  

The F-22 Combined Test Force, located at Edwards Air Force Base, conducts full-up weapons system testing to assess the effect of the F-22 combined characteristics of stealth speed, maneuverability, and integrated avionics upon mission accomplishment.  The CTF uses operationally significant ground and flight test scenarios to identify system performance deficiencies of TACMAN and TACLink 16 early before they are more difficult and costly to resolve.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Navy, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps and International Partners countries. The three variants are the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing; F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant.Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize total air system life cycle costs. Planning and pre-development systems engineering for the FOM continues as Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is met for each variant during System Development and Demonstration (SDD).

The JSF FoM efforts provide incremental warfighting capability improvements to maintain joint air dominance against current and evolving threats. FoM capability requirements were initiated through ongoing Service-led operational analysis of warfighting gaps identified in the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), and through F-35 JSF FoM Mission Decomposition analysis completed in FY2014. These analyses serve as the basis for the F-35 FoM Capabilities Development Document (CDD), staffed through the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and signed by the USAF Chief of Staff in January 2015. Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the CDD 21 March 2017. Pre-modernization activities in FY2017 and FY2018 include systems engineering, risk reduction, and infrastructure upgrades to support initial fleet availability of FoM upgrades in 2021.
 
FoM efforts designated as Block 4 include a robust weapons integration portfolio and provide new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements. Additionally, the F-35 JSF Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post-SDD block upgrade. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of up to two B-61s. Due to extensive certification requirements, the DCA capability planning and design, testing and certification will continue throughout Block 4.

The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway are participants in F-35 modernization. The program shown here reflects United States Marine Corps funding. Total funding for all Service and International Partners is reported at the accomplishment/planned program level since activities support all aircraft variants. Foreign Military Sales are ongoing separately.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 FoM provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment. Upgrades are essential mission improvements for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare. The Block 4 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities in 4 sub-blocks. The strategy includes deliveries on a two year cycle with a focus on hardware and tech refresh change every four years. FoM capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Modernization. As SDD development activities ramp down FoM will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts. Block 4 capability planning includes sub-block 4.1 through 4.4 modernization efforts with initial increment of capability available in FY2021 and subsequent releases every two years.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This is a continuation of the previous Block 4 Requirements Decomposition effort which will include activities leading up to a successful System Functional Review (SFR) and select facility upgrades required for Block 4 research, development, test and evaluation. Included in Block 4 are upgraded capabilities and continuous improvements to maintain Air System viability against evolving threats indicated in the Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICD, and the FoM Capability Development Document (CDD), reduce life cycle cost, and improve operational suitability. Expected completion of a Block 4.1 Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a Block 4.2 System Requirements Review (SRR) will address additional Block 4 capabilities requirements. Post-PDR risk reduction and pre-planning for subsequent Block 4 Modernization events are included. Capability planning effort and preparations will lead to formal acquisition approval of a Block 4 Modernization contract.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Navy.  Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002.  The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

Note:  The USAF/USN/USMC procurement lines include Aircraft Procurement and Advanced Procurement only.  Initial Spares and Repair Parts for all Services are reflected in separate lines.  International Partner Funding also includes funds provided under the Italy and Netherlands Bilateral agreements.  

RELATED RDT&amp;E:  Funding prior to JSF SDD (FY94-FY01):  USN PE 0603800N $1,950,617; USAF PE 0603800F $1,907,352; DARPA PE 0603800E $118,056; and International Partner contributions of $253,921 for a total of $4,229,946.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The FoM acquisition strategy is to employ both Cost and Fixed Price Incentive contracts for the Block 4 engineering and development efforts. A new modernization contract structure will be established for all post SDD Block 4 efforts. In addition, a separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft and supporting technology maturation for future FoM capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>F-35 Follow-on Modernization (FoM) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  Upgrades are essential mission improvements for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare.   The Block 4 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities in 4 sub-blocks.   The strategy includes deliveries on a two year cycle with a focus on hardware and tech refresh change every four years. FoM capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Modernization.  As SDD development activities ramp down, FoM will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.  Block 4 capability planning includes Block 4.1 through 4.4 modernization efforts  with intial increment of capability available in 2020 and subsequent releases every two years. 

Additionally, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A variant to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.   DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification requirements, the Follow-on Modernization Capability Development Document (CDD).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It identifies and mitigates potential technical and cost risks, as well as defines the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon. This effort also supports follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with  the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade, and is expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>F-35 Follow-on Modernization (FoM) provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment.  Upgrades are essential mission improvements for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare.   The Block 4 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities in 4 sub-blocks.   The strategy includes deliveries on a two year cycle with a focus on hardware and tech refresh change every four years. FoM capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to Follow-on Modernization.  As SDD development activities ramp down, FoM will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.  Block 4 capability planning includes Block 4.1 through 4.4 modernization efforts  with intial increment of capability available in 2020 and subsequent releases every two years. 

Additionally, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A variant to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons.   DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of two B-61s.  Due to extensive certification requirements, the Follow-on Modernization Capability Development Document (CDD).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCA effort will leverage contracting vehicles for the overall Block 4 F-35 Follow-on Modernization (FoM) effort. Fee provisions will be used to target and motivate contractor performance.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in FY11 and out is for the Block II program only.  The AIM-9X Block I program costs for FY11 and prior are $233.583M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Intercept Missile-9X is a long-term evolution of the AIM-9 series of fielded missiles, qualifying this as a research category operational systems development. The AIM-9X short range Air-to-Air missile modification program provides a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infra-Red (IR) energy for acquisition and tracking of enemy aircraft and complements the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile. Air superiority in the short range Air-to-Air Missile arena is essential and includes first shot, first kill opportunity against an enemy employing IR countermeasures. The AIM-9X employs several components common with the AIM-9M (fuze, rocket motor and warhead). The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical to project power and win decisively in accordance with the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Planning Guidance. The missile is essential to Pacific Command plans to counter threats employing advanced Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) jamming, cruise missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

The Block II program has completed Independent Operational Testing and found to be Operationally Effective and Suitable. The program obtained a Full Rate Production decision in August 2015, with the first Full Rate Production Lot contract awarded in September 2015. This budget line will continue technical refresh of critical obsolete components, implement cost reduction initiatives, improve insensitive munitions performance, correct deficiencies, increase capabilities through software enhancements, and conduct testing to ensure platform integration onto threshold US Air Force aircraft.

AIM-9X Block I concluded in FY 2011 and all funding/quantity data in the documents are associated with Block II activities.

BA7- This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities. The development program also enables AMRAAM compatibility with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities, and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions which may use AMRAAM attributes. The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation; two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility; and incorporates new guidance software which improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness. Operational Testing (OT) was completed in July 2014 and the Air Force and Navy authorized operational fielding in January 2015. The Navy declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in January 2015 and the Air Force declared IOC in July 2015. The program continues to address aircraft integration efforts to maintain compatibility/performance of the missile with changes occurring on threshold AMRAAM platforms per the Capability Production Document (CPD). To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units. AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service.

This program is in Budget Activity 7-Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The EPIP Advanced program is underway to keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment.  This effort was awarded in June 2012 as a CPFF with performance awards.  This development effort is planned for completion in July 2017.

Post-OT System Improvement Program (SIP) is underway as part of the AIM-120D missile upgrade program.  SIP Increment 1 (SIP-1) awarded in 2009 as a CPFF effort aims to improve baseline AIM-120D capabilities.  SIP-2 EMD, which incorporates basic EPIP in the AIM120D, was awarded in July 2015.  This CPIF effort was awarded for 19 months.  SIP-3 TMRR was awarded in September 2015 as a 19-month CPFF effort with SIP-3 EMD award planned for FY 17.  SIP-3 primarily incorporates AEPIP software capabilities in the AIM-120D.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ScheduleDetailNote>The EPIP Advanced program is underway to keep AIM-120C missiles capable against the growing electronic attack threat environment. This effort was awarded in June 2012 as a CPFF with performance awards. This development effort is planned for completion in July 2017.

Post-OT System Improvement Program (SIP) is underway as part of the AIM 120D missile upgrade program. SIP Increment 1 (SIP-1) awarded in 2009 as a CPFF effort aims to improve baseline AIM-120D capabilities. SIP-2 EMD, which incorporates basic EPIP in the AIM120D, was awarded in July 2015. This CPIF effort was awarded for 19 months. SIP-3 TMRR was awarded in September 2015 as a 19-month CPFF effort with SIP-3 EMD award planned for FY 17. SIP-3 primarily incorporates AEPIP software capabilities in the AIM-120D.</r2:ScheduleDetailNote>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force Rotary Wing Avionics Development and Integration effort is a program to develop a fully integrated avionics upgrade that includes predictive terrain awareness.   This program focuses on developing and integrating technologies that will increase the situational awareness of helicopter crews in a degraded visibility environment.  A severable portion of this program is Brown Out Symbology Software &amp; Landing Guidance (BOSS-LG), which provides precision approach cues to command navigation to a landing point in adverse weather and/or reduced visibility conditions.  This total effort was initiated by the Defense Safety Oversight Council. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current and subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Battlefield Airmen Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR), Maritime Recovery, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, Aerial Insertion and the Battlefield Air Operations Kit. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes and associated engineering support to posture the GA program for technology insertion. The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, requirements development and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  Due to rapidly changing threat environment, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current slated and emerging requirements.


This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Guardian Angel (GA) program will address warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen (Phase 1). The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields (Phase 2).  

Phase 2 of the GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These are being identified through updates to the Core Function Support Plan and GA Concept of Operations by HQ Air Combat Command.  The program has been divided into two phases to more rapidly meet the user's immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COMPASS CALL is the USAF's wide-area, airborne Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W /IO) weapon system.  The employment of this system interdicts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic combat system is capable of surgical denial or disruption of adversary radio frequency (RF) communications systems and sensors.  The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through the fielding of the Baseline 2 (BL2) configuration and the mid-Baseline 2 (MBL2) enhancements.  BL2 configuration and MBL2 enhancements currently being fielded have advanced COMPASS CALL's electronic attack capabilities significantly over the two previously fielded baselines (BL0 and BL1).  Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack technology, COMPASS CALL was designed to be easily modified and must continue to modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies. Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority.  The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS #1 and CCMCS #2) are upgraded per the Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft.  The Weapons System Trainer (WST) mirrors the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well to ensure training requirements provide the worldwide operational proficiency needed to comply with continually evolving communications, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) and required navigation performance (RNP) enhancements, parameters, and guidance.

The COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats.  To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds. Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as the digital signal analysis and exciter subsystem (AXE), the third generation of Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), new modern communications receiver technologies, new IR and counter radar technologies, the Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), digital cockpit avionics with multi-function displays (a.k.a. glass cockpits), network centric operations, phased array transmit and receive apertures and other classified hardware, firmware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.  

FY 2018 RDT&amp;E efforts will concentrate on support for Baseline 3 (BL3) prime mission equipment (PME) upgrades, integration of BL3 PME into a new platform, and ground systems/simulators.  The programmed BL3 upgrades will advance the PME capabilities as the 2018 development efforts address the evolving electronic attack requirement for the foreseeable future.  Obsolescence and diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade/enhancement as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities.  FY 2018 RDT&amp;E efforts include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution including, but not limited to, Advanced Radar Countermeasure System (ARCS) and environmental characterizations.  FY2018 RDT&amp;E efforts include future Baseline 4 (BL4) and future baseline capability planning, specifications and requirements.

Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during our prolonged commitment to OCO, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Changes in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts.  R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Changes in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 single-engine fighter propulsion system.  It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), corrects service revealed deficiencies, improves system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), reduces propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustains the propulsion system throughout its service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity of engines.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational.  F135 CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.    F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207277F, project 675373, ISR Innovations, is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A family of systems providing high-impact, quick-reaction capabilities to Warfighters for mission planning, rehearsal, visualization, and intelligence gathering purposes.  Program components include: Eagle Vision, DoD's only world-wide deployable commercial imagery ground station capability, and ISR Innovations, rapid prototyping, operational evaluation and fielding of short-notice, high-payoff capabilities addressing immediate gaps and/or shortfalls identified by Warfighting activities.

FY18 funds support NOWcasting, Atmospheric Sensing and Prediction System (ASAPS), and Caldera Event.

1. NOWcasting:  NOWcasting is an automated system that provides intuitive, animated, machine-to-machine weather forecasts directly to warfighter computer applications every 15 minutes.  NOWcasting expands on current weather models by incorporating non-traditional sources of weather information (the most significant being Space Based Infrared System [SBIRS] data) that significantly increases forecast resolution and accuracy.  Its exploitation of SBIRS PoR data sources helps maximize the effectiveness of existing OPIR architecture and data sources. 
 
2. ASAPS:  Atmospheric Sensing and Prediction System (ASAPS) is a platform-integrated sensor for detecting adverse weather conditions such as clouds and icing.  Sensing of other adverse weather phenomena, specifically lightning, would further protect valuable airborne assets and support mission success.  While initially envisioned to improve environmental awareness for Remotely Piloted Aircraft--which are particularly susceptible to lightning damage due to their composite structure--the technology could expand to contribute to the distributed, collaborative, and self-organizing sensor systems providing environmental threat detection for autonomous swarming aircraft.

3. Caldera Event:  Caldera Event is a non-GPS system that provides Position, Navigation, Timing (PNT), and Geolocation Capabilities in an fully GPS-denied or jammed environment.  The prototype system provides insight and experimentation for the future of combined PNT, Electronic Warfare, and communications systems.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207325F, project 675356, Warfighting Capability Enhancement, is a new start.

Note: Procurement quantities can change based on negotiated options/pricing bands and available funding, in accordance with Title 10, U.S Code Section 2308 BUY-TO-BUDGET ACQUISITION.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides a long range (over twice the range of baseline JASSM), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft. The requirement for JASSM-ER is given in JASSM-ER Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 16 Apr 2010. Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER is complete on the B-1B. Objective aircraft are B-52H, F-16C/D (Block 40-52), B-2, and F-15E. JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM Baseline while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft. The Air Force developed JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS). The program continues its development/integration efforts on the Intelligent Telemetry Instrumentation Kit (ITIK), the Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF), and the Military Code (M-Code) receiver, and FTS-TIK batteries. Our studies in FY16/17 led to safety/survivability via Wing Replacement/Chine Development/Integration, and Warfighting Capability Enhancement (Software) to enhance the aerodynamic performance against emerging threats. Future efforts added are Anti-Radiation Homing System (ARHS), improved Data Link capability for relocatable target attack, alternate payloads, and improved Guidance Navigation Control (GNC), and alternative FTS-TIK battery studies.  The program is also evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) and reviewing obsolescence issues.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207410F, project 675218, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications, is a new start.

In FY 2018, PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), efforts were transferred to PE 0305984F, Personnel Recovery Command &amp; Ctrl (PRC2), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), in order to improve visibility on Service's fair share of development funding for this joint interest program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2017, AOC WS Modifications was a new start.
In FY 2017, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications was a new start.  This effort was delayed one year as a result of the AOC 10.2 Critical Change which delayed integration into current AOC WS baseline.

The Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS) program element provides development of Command and Control (C2) capabilities across the entire spectrum of air and space operations from the strategic to the tactical level.  There are four funded projects within the AOC WS program element:

AOC WS Modifications allow for the consolidation to a single baseline across the AOC WS enterprise and provide required modifications and pathfinder efforts for the AOC WS to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades.  Modifications are required for the AOC WS to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective training solutions for the user.

Applications Development provides worldwide operational level C2 capabilities, which include: air battle planning, management, and execution; operational level C2 of Integrated Air and Missile Defense (C2 of IAMD); in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.

Unit Command and Control (UC2) provides both scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions of future Air Battle Planning.

Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) provides an adaptive, networked, decentralized and situationally-appropriate personnel recovery C2 system which supports personnel accountability and recovery missions worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated system to prevent, prepare for and respond to isolating events across the Range of Military Operations in the joint/coalition operating environment.  The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis/assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across DoD and other national and international entities.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY 2018: Funding increased $7.700M in AOC WS Modifications to accelerate C2AOS-C2IS integration on AOC 10.1.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations.  The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign.  The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents.  The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

In FY 2017, AOC WS Modifications was a new start.

In FY18, AOC WS Modifications are required to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core System Force Level (TBMCS FL) and the legacy AOC 10.1 system.  Further, AOC WS Modifications are required for the AOC to keep pace with evolving COTS/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integration, testing, fielding, training, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades to the AOC WS.  Additionally, in FY18 AOC WS Modification activities evolve the AOC through development, integration, and test of progressively improving capabilities in support of mission requirements at Geographic and Global (formerly Functional) AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units, keeping the AOC current and interoperable with the Combatant Commands (CCMD), cyber requirements, and next generation weapon systems/weapons.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize and modify the AOC WS.  The initial capability was AOC WS Increment 10.0, which fielded the 10.0 configuration to five operational sites, plus a Help Desk and a Formal Training Unit.  The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide.  The AOC 10.2, evolves the AOC to a Net-Centric environment, compliant with DoD SOA standards.  The AOC WS Modifications program builds upon these evolutionary weapon system updates to develop, integrate, test, train, deliver, and sustain new capabilities and baseline updates to the AOC WS.  The AOC WS Modifications program will leverage an AOC WS Long-Term Modification and Sustainment (LTM&amp;S) contract, awarded in 3QFY17, which will provide for government led integration of the AOC WS enterprise.  The AOC WS Program Management Office (PMO) will provide technical oversight to the AOC WS Modification program, led by a Government AOC Weapon System (WS) Chief Engineer.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 07 PE 0207410F, project 675218, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications, is a new start.

FY 2018: Funding increased $7.900M in Applications Development to fund completion of C2AOS-C2IS development efforts.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire and modify segments of Air Force's (AF) Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services.  Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies.  These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems.  Application Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013).  These activities include C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS) needs identified in the Capability Definition Package (CDP) (2012).  C2AOS-C2IS creates web-enabled information services to expose air operations data using standardized schemas, such as those developed by the Air Operations Community of Interest.  C2AOS-C2IS also develops, matures, fields, and maintains modular net-centric C2 applications for air battle planning, execution, and management functions. These applications include Network Enabled Weapons (NEW); the remainder of the CDP and Theater Battle Management Core Systems - Force Level (TBMCS FL) functionality; services to support air mission and Friendly Order of Battle execution, Alerting, Publish and Subscribe, Content Management and Reporting; and integration with a JC2 Reference Architecture (RA) host infrastructure environment.

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

In FY 2017, C2AOS-C2IS Modifications was a new start.  This effort was delayed one year as a result of the AOC 10.2 Critical Change which delayed integration into current AOC WS baseline.


In FY18, core development activities will be complete and focus will be on testing, addressing discrepancies discovered during testing, Information Assurance (IA), and the start of modernization planning for 4th/5th generation fighter platforms.

BA7 - This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Unlike many traditional R&amp;D programs, however, the ATOMS development contract is a FPIF contract with progress payments.  Twenty percent (20%) of incurred costs are withheld until the end of the contract, when they are liquidated.  Mandatory funding obligations and progress payment withholds will cause the program to lag traditional expenditure benchmarks, painting an inaccurate portrait of overall program health.</r2:Remarks>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY 2018: Funding decreased $4.000M in Unit Level as Unit Command and Control (UC2) Rel 1.3 efforts complete.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project funds are used to develop and integrate Unit Command and Control (UC2) as an evolving sequence of increasing software capabilities that support the execution of the air battle plan and the air tasking order message received from the AOC.  UC2 operations software systems meet needs identified in the TBMCS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (2001), the UC2 Baseline System Requirements Document (SRD) by providing both the scheduling and mission preparation activities at the wing, group and squadron level, and the capabilities to report and track the success of each mission and influence decisions on future air battle planning.  UC2 is fielded to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Crisis Action Team (CAT), and many other work-centers.    

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current and future program planning and execution.

In FY18, core development activities will be to complete development of UC2 1.3 which will allow UC2 to be accessed on mobile platforms.  Additional FY18 activities will include resolving deficiencies discovered during developmental tests (DT), maintaining information assurance (IA) posture, and ensuring integration and testing of UC2 interfaces with other applications.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds operational development necessary to acquire, modify, and sustain a segment of Air Force's C2 capabilities and services associated with Personnel Recovery.  The Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2) program develops and delivers tools and services for planning, collaborating and managing search and rescue efforts, as well as disseminating related information to all personnel recovery mission coordinators across the PR network.  PRC2 provides an adaptive and networked system, delivering timely situational awareness information supporting personnel accountability and recovery mission management worldwide.  PRC2 delivers a globally accessible, collaborative, interoperable and integrated set of capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to joint/coalition military personnel recovery activities, and civilian rescue missions.  The Joint Personnel Recovery (JPR) Initial Capability Document (ICD) (2012) articulates capabilities needed for PRC2.

The system collects, stores and delivers personnel/identity biometric data, emergency locator beacon registrations, isolated personnel reports, evasion plans of action, incident reports and other information management capabilities.  The information is used for predictive, preventive and personnel vulnerability analysis and assessment in support of Personnel Recovery across Department of Defense and other national and international entities. 

Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

In FY 2018, PE 0207410F, Air &amp; Space Operations Center (AOC), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), efforts were transferred to PE 0305984F, Personnel Recovery Command &amp; Ctrl (PRC2), Project Number 675221, Personnel Recovery Command and Control (PRC2), in order to improve visibility on Service's fair share of development funding for this joint interest program.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>PE 0207412F CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN/TSC-147 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) Module (JM) (to be replaced by Link 16 Upgrade) Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS), AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN/TPS-75 Radar, CRC’s organic radar, which will be replaced by the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) (PE0207455). Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Roadmap provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037.

CRC begins its Phase 1 Modernization effort in FY17.  Phase 1 addresses, but is not limited to, AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 OM Increment 1 (Multiple Source Correlator Tracker (MSCT) software upgrades, 3DELRR Integration and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet) integration), JM Link 16 upgrade and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS). 

In FY17, OM Mod Increment 1 was a new start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. This budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing Battle management (BM)/Command and Control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

1. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON):  DRAGON completes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene BM/C2. DRAGON replaces the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Additionally, the acquisition of DRAGON flight simulators also contains DMS efforts which include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber resilient. The simulator effort also implements requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. DRAGON will provide development of support and test equipment needed for DRAGON production; DRAGON will also provide initial DMS and Initial Contractor Support (ICS) needed to support the first US developmental test aircraft (i.e., D-1) prior to the contract award of the DRAGON production effort. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON is being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

2. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP):  EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement.  Processing will initially address radar modes comprising 90% of operational AWACS radar usage.  EP will install an adjunct processor that works in parallel with the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system.  The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the battle manager's display in place of the current RSIP output when the EP radar modes are selected.  

3.  E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI):  TSI provides continuing management support for AWACS modernization and enhancement. These activities include managing the AWACS Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) and Production infrastructure and tracking and monitoring the AWACS vendor’s core mission and aircrew training, support equipment and program Government Furnished Property. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports development, production, and sustainment projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing at Boeing Field, WA, Baltimore, MD, and Oklahoma City, OK.  Funding is shared between Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and production funds.  The TSI assets also support multiple international Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) projects on a maintenance fee basis, not limited to projects for France, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, and North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) AEW&amp;C efforts. Key programs include contractual management of the AWACS Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) integrated with the Block 40/45 Functional Group configured lab and the AWACS Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF). These labs provide US, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and international customers with a configured development and qualification system and subsystem environment supporting all AWACS system and radar development, production, and sustainment.  TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. 

4. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR):  C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system. These efforts also include but are not limited to the investigation, analysis, and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of materiel solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as materiel solutions for the user needs.  C2ISR will also support an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, and life-cycle cost of alternative materiel solutions beyond the current AWACS that satisfy an established capability need identified in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).

5. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC):  IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a medium-bandwidth Internet Protocol (IP) communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare. IPEC will provide a reliable IP-enabled communication capability to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time-sensitive targets. The modification will provide a permanent Inmarsat-based IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for increased bandwidth Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and multi-domain networks.  IPEC was originally planned for accomplishment as a traditional acquisition program, but due to warfighter demand, the effort has been re-classified as an Urgent Operational Need (UON). 

6. E-3 Combat Identification (CID) DMS:  AWACS' current CID capability is based upon 1960's era technology that has become unsustainable, and requires an update to retain a significant part of AWACS overall mission capability.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls with a modern, persistent Airborne Moving Target Indication (AMTI) BM/C2 combat ID.  CID DMS supports the kill chain and decision superiority.

In FY17 CID was a new start. 

7. E-3 Communication Network Upgrade (CNU):  CNU will provide a Link 16 capability with high-jam-resistance, high-speed, crypto-secure computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.  Current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/DMS issues and does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) &amp; Freq. Remap (FR).  CNU resolves DMS issues, provides CM &amp; FR, Link 16 enhancements &amp; growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).  In previous budget cycle, this effort was referred to as Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS).  Risk reduction activities are being executed in cooperation with foreign partners.

In FY17 CNU was a new start

E-3 Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Acceleration: Updates flight deck to address known Air Traffic Management restrictions; replace analog equipment with modern digital avionics to include ADS B Out and Mode 5 transponder; DRAGON’s IOC 2020 – FOC 2026 does not meet ADS B out or Mode 5 mandates.  Accelerates ADS-B Out and Mode 5 transponder from DRAGON – moves FOC for this DRAGON subset from FY25 to FY21.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational Systems Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal (JTC TRS) Program, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for Battlefield Airmen, to include Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) operations, Special Tactics Combat Control Team (CCT) Air Traffic Control (ATC), Assault Zone operations, and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations.

JTC TRS is essential to provide initial training, mission qualification training, continuation training, and currency control requirements to JTACs and Special Tactics personnel. JTAC control training requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability enabling JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification.

The JTC TRS Program provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards. Future JTC TRS development will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration. The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.

JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/Special Operations Forces (SOF) Command and Control (C2) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts for systems, fielded or approved, for production, that have been fully validated through formal Operation Utility Evaluation (OUE) and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.   Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the JTC TRS weapon system capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>a. The JTC TRS acquisition is a single step to full capability as defined in the CPD. A small business set-aside competitive lowest price technically acceptable source selection was conducted and resulted in the award of a single contract to produce and sustain JTC TRS.  The contract includes pre-priced production options for additional JTC TRS production, Emulated Military Equipment (EME) program management, cybersecurity support, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS), Training System Support Center (TSSC), training, relocation, a legacy system compatibility study and an Air Traffic Control upgrade.  The pre-price production options include credit to the government for use of existing equipment when updating current fielded active duty immersive JTAC training systems (Air National Guard (ANG) Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS)) to the JTC TRS baseline. The contract structure allows for maintaining concurrency, implementing system improvements/technical refresh, and other modifications as required.  JTC TRS awarded a competitive contract in January 2016 to procure up to 32 devices.  The JTC TRS received a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision in February 2017 and is currently fielding production units.  . Development will be required for engineering changes related to Legacy System Compatibility, Air Traffic Control (ATC), TACP-Close Air Support System (TACP-CASS) and Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II).

b. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS development, deployment and integration. Current software is Government or Commercial Off-the-Shelf technologies (GOTS/COTS) allowing almost any training technology development company to compete, which lowers technical risk, schedule risk, and cost.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides support to personnel using Geospatial resources utilized in Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) databasing applications, unit level intelligence, technology exploration and refresh initiatives, management and dissemination architecture, geospatial information and services modernization, and enablers for targeting capabilities. Provides support to the MAJCOMs to ensure requisite and available target intelligence and GEOINT tools for information directly available to warfighters. 

The GEOINT information and service software program funds the Air Force Geospatial Product Library (GPL) which is currently fielded to all combatant command air components and subordinate units supporting global air operations. The GPL provides digital GEOINT data to support mission planning, targeting &amp; intelligence in support of mission objectives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Partys (TACP) are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. TACPs also coordinate, request, and control airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.  

The purpose of the TACP-Modernization program is to upgrade TACP voice, data and video communications capabilities, upgrade targeting capabilities, and improve TACP battlefield awareness capabilities. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Centers (ASOC), Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage through the use of networked data communications.

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in three major categories/areas:(1) ASCOC/TOC Systems (used in fixed ASOCs and Army TOCs), (2) Dismounted and Mobile Systems (used by JTACs during infantry operations and vehicle-mounted mobile operations), and (3) Close Air Support System (CASS) software. CASS v1.4.5 software comes in two versions: A) Dismounted version for dismounted mission operations and a B) ASOC, TOC, and Mounted (ATM) version for ASOC, TOC, and Mobile systems.


CASS software segment interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF). CASS software will provide advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by Dismounted JTACs, for vehicle-mounted systems, and for stationary systems used in operations centers. Future upgrades necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms will be guided by the TACP CASS Information System Initial Capabilities Document (IS ICD) approved by the Air Force Requirement Oversight Council (AFROC), Functional Capabilities Board (FCB), and Joint Capabilities Board (JCB). 

 
CASS v2.0 provides a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The architecture includes a Core Module, an HMI module, and an Application Logic module with multiple mission plug-in features. The software is being developed in two versions ASOC/TOC (A/T) and Dismounted/Mounted (D/M) to support a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/ PRC-148, AN/PRC-152A, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-158, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN/PRC-150C, and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future).  The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new external devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and  rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements.

  
This program is in Budget Activity 07, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line- of-Sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the data link to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions. TDLs are used by all service theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. 

TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT). TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016E) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball. TDLs keep all Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA / DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. Due to new/evolving Link 16 User identified Interface Changes Proposals (ICPs), studies and analysis will be performed to identify impacts to current and future systems, and to identify the required changes and impacts of implementing these new capabilities. The activities will include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development. These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or has approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Air Force Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Networks (PEO C3I&amp;N) is the PEO for C2ISR TDL. PEO C3I&amp;N manages activities for the common development, integration, and interoperability across the entire airborne network. These actions ensure TDLs are procured and maintained as a joint, end-to-end C2 system. This program executes various types of contract types to provide technical expertise necessary to test, evaluate and provide recommended solutions to modernize C2 platform data links. The program delivers annual lab-tested software implementations of AWACS Link 16 ICPs. Additionally, the program participates in annual lab demonstrations that produce reports as required to assist with platform integration of Link 16 modernization efforts.

The E-3 Platform architecture utilizes a JTIDS Class 2H Link 16 radio with defined environmental and physical cabinet constraints. An Investigation Report (IR) was initiated to investigate the integration of an Ethernet-enabled CMN4 MIDS JTRS variant into the E-3 platform. A separate IR was issued to understand the dynamics of the L-16 enhancements and facilitate integration of new Link 16 capabilities onto the E-3 platform to ensure cross-service interoperability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is to support Joint and Air Force Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) needs by enabling the warfighter to rapidly respond to a Combatant Commander's (COCOM's) force requirements through the development, management, presentation, and execution of scalable packages of manpower and equipment comprising our Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Provide real-time command, control, planning, and execution information supporting the United States Air Force (USAF) manpower, personnel, operations and logistics force presentation and execution processes while providing a single integrated data environment to project aerospace power anywhere in world. DCAPES enables force projection C2 to all missions requiring USAF presence regardless of mission type (contingency, humanitarian, disaster relief, etc.).

DCAPES funding will be executed against capabilities packaged into agile development projects for multiple incremental deliveries based on the warfighter's priorities.  Additionally, funding will be used to cover downward directed federal mandates.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order for a one-year Base Period and four one-year Option Periods using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance started on 6 April 2015 and ends on 5 April 2020, given all option years are exercised. 

DCAPES is an Evolutionary Acquisition Program using an incremental development approach (DoDI 5000.02 Model 3) to develop capabilities over several increments. To support the rapid development and delivery of capabilities, DCAPES will transition from a waterfall approach used in Increment 2A to a hybrid agile acquisition strategy in which capabilities are incrementally delivered in time-phased stages based on warfighter priorities and adoption of key architecture and technology requirements as a trade-off for accelerated delivery and risk reduction.

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) will utilize a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 46th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system. 

The DCAPES Increment 2B requirements have been packaged into multiple discreet capabilities which will be developed in multiple smaller increments. Each capability will be developed using several builds and with one or more fieldings to satisfy the approved requirements within each package.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCAPES Increment 2A delivered Air Force functional specific capabilities as well as technical changes necessary for the Air Force to migrate from a directly connected architectural relationship with the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) to one utilizing data services across the Wide Area Network (WAN).  This ‘Loose Coupling’ solution enabled DCAPES to be interoperable with JOPES and at the same time significantly reduced interoperability costs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this Budget Activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Increment 2A used the Waterfall approach to develop functional capabilities and maintain interoperability with JOPES.  The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Development Task Order using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This task order was used to close out Increment 2A. 

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) utilized a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Prompt Diagnostics efforts were transferred to PE 0207573F, BPAC 674881 National Technical Nuclear Forensics, Project Prompt Diagnostics.  This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) is the collection, analysis and evaluation of pre- and post-detonation radiological and nuclear materials, devices, and debris as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation. NTNF will develop prompt diagnostic detection systems to record signals emitted immediately following a nuclear detonation.
This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in countless different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft stores combinations change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Loads, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends about 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS).  SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I &amp; II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades (BLU-111/BLU-117), practice bomb and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications.  SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft, assist the F-35 JPO with subject matter expertise in the System Development and Demonstration phase (e.g., development of organic store certifications capability to support F-35 in the Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development phases), sustain organic F-22 store certifications capability, and to obtain non-inventory stores and store data for post-integration certification requirements.  

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  These budget activities include development efforts to upgrade systems currently fielded or which have approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2018, PE 0207601F, USAF Modeling and Simulation, Project 674567, M&amp;S Foundations (MSF) efforts were transferred to PE 0207605F, Wargaming and Simulation Centers, Project 672888, Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC), in order to support the Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>United States Air Force (USAF) Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Program Element (PE) is broken into two thrust areas:  Modeling and Simulation Foundations, and Warfighter Readiness.  It directly supports USAF, Joint and Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing through modeling and simulation development as well as the integration of these across and within Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) environments.  This program focuses on support of Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2).  It allows the authoritative portrayal of new and emerging USAF capabilities within DoD and coalition LVC environments; as well as reciprocating capabilities within USAF LVC environments.  

LVC environments today are used as the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  In support of the DoD T2 initiative, USAF M&amp;S program thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations that are the constructive backbone of USAF and joint training and rehearsal.  Once these models and simulations are developed, they are integrated across training LVC environments for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  This development and integration is imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  These, in turn, enable joint, coalition, and interagency training required to prepare forces for combat by generating the air and space picture for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), and Joint Force Commander in combat exercises; training over 100,000 personnel per year in exercises (e.g., Ulchi Freedom Guardian, Red &amp; Blue Flags, Unified Endeavor, etc).  These programs also provide the current foundational environment that enables warfighters to interact with high-fidelity tactical cockpit simulators, which replicate high demand/low density platforms that are often unavailable for training due to real-world operations; while simultaneously linking it to warfighters using their current command and control systems 1,000 miles away and the constructive simulations being run from key operational wargaming and simulation centers worldwide. 

USAF M&amp;S is integral to inter-agency Homeland Defense (HLD) exercises chartered to train combat units tasked to protect the Homeland. This generates equipment and manpower efficiencies by using simulations which reduce fuel consumption, aircraft wear and tear, and manpower costs.  In support of the DoD drive to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its enterprise-wide acquisition business processes, the USAF M&amp;S Program Element develops and supports enhancements to models, simulations, tools, and the LVC infrastructure to provide for system-of-systems M&amp;S capabilities across the lifecycle, reduce developmental costs, and minimize risks. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MSF  focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness of M&amp;S capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  

MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsal.   

ACE-IOS provides the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is comprised of models that support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands (COMD) battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises and experimentations.  

Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) focuses on fostering M&amp;S tools, data, and infrastructure to enable high confidence acquisition of capabilities to support the joint warfighter.  This includes Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) infrastructure, tools and processes supporting LVC events, and models, tools, data, simulations/stimulation to support requirements definition, systems engineering and test activities.  Activities include M&amp;S support for studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  These efforts will enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  It includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combat Commanders battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) &amp; Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment – Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS)

The DMOC provides comprehensive Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, space, and cyber domains for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force, joint service, and coalition partners.  The Distributed Mission Operations Center - Cyber (DMOC-C) provides the Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment – Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) to support Air Force information operations.  The DMOC training capabilities reach 31 geographically separated LVC locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution by:
 
1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various systems, tools, and simulators to incorporate ever-changing technology and emerging training requirements into DMO events; such as, Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (CVF) to enhance the quality of warfighter training.  Activities include Environment Generator development, DMO Tool Development, and Simulator Enhancement.  DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).  The NGTS is the primary environment generator for both Blue and Red Air in DMOC White Force.  The DMOC “Replay Tool” facilitates a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events.  Future DMO Tool development includes:  a. enhancement &amp; improvement of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) Filter and the Doctor-J (Dr. J) tools to enable tactical datalinks to be communicated and translated between disparate simulator and operationally fielded (i.e. live aircraft) communication formats; b. Development of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)/Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) to improve damage state models used by intelligence analysts in exercises, and c. development of solutions for integrating Contested Degraded Operations (geographical and communications jamming) into DMO events; and simulator enhancement efforts incorporate Mission Package standards upgrades into the Control and Reporting Center (CRC) Simulation Package (CSP) to allow a real-world system to be used as a simulator when needed in DMO events.

2. Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A) and Networthiness:  The DMOC supports requirements definition, integration test support, analysis, systems engineering support, and C&amp;A and Networthiness of core systems.  It implements requirements of Cybersecurity and is working toward the application of the Risk Management Framework and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include Cross-Domain Information Sharing / Multi-national Information Sharing (CDIS/MNIS) ruleset development, load sharing, and testing; accreditation of various newly developed / updated systems such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, DIS Filter, and the DMOC Battlespace.

3. Distributed Training Sites &amp; Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates up to 30 geographically separated LVC training locations and 50+ systems into LVC DMO training events such as VF and CVF by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into LVC DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) emerging requirements.

ACE-IOS is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests and experiments.  The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  The CSC is managed by the 90th Cyberspace Operations Squadron, a unit of the 318th Cyberspace Operations Group, 688th Cyberspace Wing, 24th Air Force (AFCYBER).  The Distributed Mission Operations Center for Cyberspace (DMOC-C) is a subset of the CSC focused on training and exercising tactical cyber mission forces (CMF) and cyber service providers (CSP) and operational-level command and control, intelligence, and cyber planners and operators.  DMOC-C, using ACE-IOS, directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing for use by Major and Combatant Commands.   DMOC-C thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations covering cyberspace, intelligence and command and control activities as part of the constructive backbone of Air Force capabilities within DOD and coalition LVC environments. This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.  

DMOC-C’s development and integration efforts on ACE-IOS are imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  LVC environments today are used as one of the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  These efforts enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.

Certification and Accreditation is maintained via the Information Technology (IT) systems Risk Management Framework (RMF) for six classified systems and two supported cross domain solutions, which includes code and ruleset development, testing, and fielding, and meets AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and AF Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) net worthiness standards and evaluations.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipated production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC):

The DMOC supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases. Due to evolving modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.

DMOC has the following two primary contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, cross-domain information sharing testbed, and exercises on AF/Joint/Coalition DMO networks.  Additionally, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) are sent to other external organizations (i.e. NAWCAD and DMOC-S) to fund development of DMO tools that support DMOC efforts.

Infrastructure, Development, and Engineering (IDE) Contract: Develops/upgrades various DMOC tools, systems, and simulators that are needed to conduct DMO training events. Develops, implements, and tests technical solutions for the integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events. The current IDE contract is cost-plus-fixed-fee with multiple task orders awarded for individual projects over the course of the fiscal year, and the follow-on IDE contract, which is scheduled to be awarded in the 2nd quarter of FY17, will be firm-fixed-price.

Command and Control Technical Support Contract (C2TSC): Supports government by assisting with development of technical requirements for upgrades to various systems and tools that will be developed by the IDE contractor and then performs acceptance testing of the those products. Develops requirements for site/system integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events. C2TSC is a firm-fixed-price contract.

Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment – Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS):

Acquisition goals are achieved through incremental development of the project's M&amp;S activities; all contracts are awarded using full and open competition. To meet evolving M&amp;S technology, and the challenges of new requirements arriving almost daily, DMOC-C is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing and upgrading environment generators, systems, and tools and to ensure integration and interoperability with other LVC systems to provide the best warfighter training possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the CSAF Title 10 wargaming efforts to test concepts, capabilities, programming choices, and plans using simulation and other techniques, otherwise known as wargaming. Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal pressure to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department. This effort requires continued funding to maintain the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources. The Air Force is charting a new course to better integrate and synergize the wargaming efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process. Specifically, in addition to maintaining a robust Title 10 Wargame series, Global Engagement, servicing Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) objectives, the HAF Wargaming Enterprise is executing on-call Wargaming in support of the AF/A5/8, the Agile series, along with quick-turning wargame support to the USAF Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) requirements, the Enterprise series, as well as, a wargame series, Plan Blue, to service AF/A5S strategy and concept development objectives; all to better address the requirements of the SP3 process and cycles. Additionally, HAF Wargaming provides and coordinates Air Force representation at other Service and Joint wargames as they execute across the department. These efforts are providing decision support to senior Air Force leaders with regard to investment strategies and develop concepts to best employ U.S. forces in future conflicts.

The Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives. The backbone of the WIE is GameNet, a deployable, standalone, Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three-dimensional visualizations &amp; mapping and services. Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off-the-shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame. The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions, and execute moves within the wargame; documenting each step in the process.  This information capture enables discovery during the wargame and permits post-game analysis. These findings inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making. Having concluded Global Engagement 16, the current wargaming cycle, the current version of the WIE is being given a major overall to match the new charter and SP3 process along with supporting greater number and more diverse wargames. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>- Expanded the WIE from the current construct to support Air Force Materiel Command, Air Mobility Command and Air Force Space Command wargames. This required reprograming of some hard coded, CONOPS-specifics to into broader, more generic, wargame support. Additional models and analytical tools used by other wargames and organizations required the creation of custom interfaces to allow interaction within the WIE.  Examples include analytic tools being tested for agile combat support and operational energy management.  Additionally, registration and IT permissions process were templated and partially automated in order to better service a more diverse user pool and mission set. 
- Developed and deployed the Force Tracker Request For Forces (RFF) Tool. RFF Tool permits wargame participants to nominate, vet, and authorize the movement of forces through player selected processes reflecting experimental command and control constructs tested in Flexible Engagement and Global Engagement 16. Its integration into the previously developed Force Tracker suite makes the process transparent in a universally accessible database, eliminating errors in transposition.  It also serves as a record of participant decisions suitable for subsequent analysis.</r2:Text>

- Continue to expand and develop the WIE, incorporating latest technology and tools, in support of a more flexible and agile wargaming enterprise; quicker to respond and tailorable for a wider range of wargaming. This will require analysis of utility and functionality of additional models and analytical tools used by other wargames, as well as creation of custom interfaces to allow interaction within the WIE.  Given the sharp increase in the number and frequency of diverse wargames, additional capacity is being acquired to manage a greater number of server instantiations that serve as the informational architecture for each effort.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In order to achieve an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources, the newly revamped wargame approach will require an evolutionary acquisition approach and continued senior-leadership engagement in setting the objectives and strategy for every wargame. Contract support will be required because that is where wargame specialized expertise resides. The requirements are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately defined at the outset of the contract; therefore, a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract will be used. There is currently an adequate accounting system and government monitoring in place. The Air Force is aware of the increased risk but Air Force will continue to monitor the performance and cost to ensure the contractor has efficient methods and effective cost controls.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>MPS Increment 5 Prior Years funding of $46.121M and FY16 funding of $13.762 was executed in BPAC 675380</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for all Department of Defense (DoD) platforms.  It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions.  It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue.  MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and is shared with the selected programs in the Navy.  MPS will deliver significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.

MPS Increment 5 will complete the initial migration of Air Force platforms from their legacy planning systems to the new Mission Planning System (aka the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS)).  It will complete development of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects with the MPS Modernization development effort.  Those projects are: 1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS); 2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and 3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR).  These projects, and their associated platforms, are now included in the overarching MPS Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) program as MPS Increment 5 to improve transparency and oversight.  As such, MPS Increment 5 is a continuation of efforts previously started under the development umbrella of the MPS Modernization project.

FY18 funding will continue the MPS software development program.  It will develop pre-, post-, and in-flight mission planning capabilities for Air Force aircraft Global Positioning System (GPS) and weapons migrating from legacy mission planning systems to the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), as well as, continuing to provide new capabilities and updates for Air Force platforms/weapon systems that have already migrated to JMPS.  These platforms/weapon systems include, but are not limited to, the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60, and their associated weapons (e.g. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munitions (JASSM), Network Enabled Weapons (NEW)etc.) Development of NEW modules support the configuration of this class of weapons, thereby; enabling warfighters to enter and execute missions using data links used by US and coalition aircraft. 

FY18 funding will also continue the development of the Mobility Air Force Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) to realize fuel savings and other efficiencies.  
  
Joint Precision Airdrop System- Mission Planning (JPADS-MP)  will be utilized to continue development of elements of Mission Planning Systems  in conjunction with the Army. This program will continue the development of JPADS-MP airdrop software (and other system components) to provide a precision airdrop capability for the C-17, C-130 and other selected platforms as necessary. The JPADS product provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions, as well as, precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/or standoff precision delivery.  JPADS-MP enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc... to accurately deliver payloads to keep the warfighter supplied and in the fight.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) capability in conjunction with the Army.  JPADS provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements.  It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys.  JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, etc., to accurately deliver payloads to combat and other friendly forces.

The Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable.  It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop.  Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit.  These efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).

In addition the Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) led Precision Airdrop (PAD) Flagship Capability Concept (FCC) effort will transition technology for new capabilities into various CAT software release/deliverables.  The PAD FCC is also charged with updating airdrop platforms and airdrop related systems to improve accuracy across all airdrop mission types.  

FY18 funding continues CAT v6.x and 7.x development and testing to provide precision and conventional airdrop capabilities including, but not limited to, Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE), Combination Airdrop, Personnel Airdrop, Unified Mission Configuration Editor, Falconview Overlays and Advanced Launch Acceptance Regions (LAR) and Failure Footprints, Kalman Filter Implementation and calculation optimization, Humanitarian airdrop, and bundle tracking for AF and other services (e.g. the Army) aircraft platforms. 

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, which includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production, and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MPS PADS efforts are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  Efforts to accomplish activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are completed using competitively awarded contracts (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor, provides technical support via a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished using Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).  As an example, a portion of funding is transferred via MIPR to the Defense Information Systems Agency’s Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DISA/DITCO) who contracts for AFLCMC/HBM at a fee.

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) is the Contracting Authority and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller Support.  

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Battle Management (AFPEO/BM) is the PEO and Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for the PADS program.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration.  It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie.  The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type.  Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.
This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, F-16, F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:

1) CAF MPS Modernization:  These development efforts modernize CAF Mission Planning Environments (MPEs).  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort include, but are not limited to, B-1 (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17, 17a and 18), F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9 and 10), F-16 Block 30 (System Capability Upgrade [SCU] 9, F-16 Block 40/50 (M6.1, M6.5, M7.1, and M7.2) and F-22 (Increments 3.2B, 3.2M, and 4.0).  CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons including, but not limited to, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).

c. F-16 Block 40/50 Modernization Phases I&amp;II:  The F-16 Block 40/50 modernization efforts will provide the capability to plan/utilize a number or OFP-driven capabilities in the platform.  The modernization efforts will support new aircraft capabilities established in OFPs for M7.1 and M7.2.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to, integrating the Universal Armament Interface (UAI) with the most recent version of Weapons Planning Software (WPS) to give the platform the ability to plan missions for any type of Network Enabled Weapon. It will also provide for UAI compliance with the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB; GBU-39) and the Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM; GBU-54).  The modernization effort will also provide for the use of the Advanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) Mode 5 capability in the F-16 Blk 40/50.  AIFF will allow use of enhanced authentication and verification of friendly signals through the incorporation of cryptographically secured signals.  It will also introduce Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out) technology and facilitate compliance with standards for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), JASSM-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) upgrades.  M7.2 will also migrate the F-16 Block 40/50 MPE to the Windows 10 operating environment. A follow on effort to F-16 Mod Phase III will be planned in FY19.

d. F-22 Modernization Phase I:  The F-22 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates v13 and v14.  These enhancements include, but are not limited to, the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, combat identification improvements, addition of an Inter-flight Data Link Gateway, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool.  Additionally, other new and emerging OFP-generated requirements will be addressed as identified by the operational user(s).  Other Common Component (CC) updates will also be completed as required.

e. B-1 Modernization Phase I&amp;II:  The B-1 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates for Releases 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 11.0.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MPS Increment 5 will complete the initial migration of Air Force platforms from their legacy planning systems to the new Mission Planning System (aka the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS)).  It will complete development and begin Operational Testing (OT) of three efforts originally started as separate and individual projects within the MPS Modernization development effort.  Those projects are:

1) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS);
2) Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transition; and 
3) Special Mission Air Combat Command, Combat Search and Rescue (SMACC CSAR)

These projects, and their associated platforms, are now included in the overarching MPS Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS) program as MPS Increment 5 to provide improved transparency and oversight.  As such, MPS Increment 5 is a continuation of efforts previously started under the development umbrella of the MPS Modernization project. The overall purpose of MPS is to provide a suite of mission planning systems that can be integrated with USAF Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) systems for the operational management of Combat Air Force (CAF) and Mobility Air Force (MAF) aerial assets and the support of USAF training requirements. MPS allows aircrews to electronically receive tasking orders, intelligence information, target coordinates, imagery and other information. This information is then used to organize and prepare flight (including cargo airdrop) and weapons delivery planning data (e.g., maps, charts, imagery, flight logs, radar predications, and navigation databases) this is electronically transferred to aircraft and weapons.

Specific capabilities include but are not limited to the following:
  
A. Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS):  The MAFPS component to MPS Increment 5 provides modern flight planning service compliant with current and emerging airspace and air traffic control constraints.  Central to the program is an improved route and fuel optimizer.  MAFPS replaces the legacy Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP) system.  Warfighter benefits include:

- Flight planning calculations for Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)-managed missions and AMC aircraft
- Produce and graphically display optimum mission routes, fuel calculations, and aerial refueling activity
- Calculate optimized fuel loads to include Cost Indexing
- Graphical user interface and capability to dynamically re-compute flight plans

B. AMC Transition:  The AMC Transition to MPS component will migrate selected Airlift (C-5), Tanker (KC-135, KC-10) and Air Drop (C-17, C-130) platforms from their legacy Portable Flight Planning Systems (PFPS) mission planning systems which is sun setting in August 2018.  Additional warfighter benefits include:

- Color moving map (Digimap) Common Component
- Enhanced Air Refueling Common Component
- Aircraft Flight Performance Module (FPM)/Take-Off and Landing Data (TOLD)/ Vehicle Install Package (VIP) Development
- Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) certified navigation avionics images

C. Special Missions Air Combat Command (SMACC) Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR):  This development effort will migrate the CSAR community (HH-60, HC/MC-130 aircraft) from PFPS to the MPS environment.  Warfighter benefits include:

- Ability to support a spectrum of missions ranging from simple day-to-day training and proficiency flying to peacetime operational/exercise sorties
- Rapid mission planning
- Mission data transfer to the aircraft via DTD
- In flight situational awareness</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Increment 5 consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments.  It leverages strategies and efforts originally established under MPS Increment IV and MPS Modernization.  The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple ID/IQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) contracts for software development.  Currently there are 5 qualified contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, and each Delivery Order (DO) is competed among the 5 contractors.

Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)).

Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations.

MITRE, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.

Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR).

For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides program management, contracting, legal, and financial management support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Offensive Cyberspace Operations (OCO) program develops operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, technology demonstrations, and other Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. This program consists of a portfolio of programs and projects called the Offensive Cyber Product Line (OCPL) that contribute to an overall Distributed Cyber Weapons Operations (DCWO) architecture. The OCPL establishes a flexible and balanced approach to the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. OCPL effectiveness comes from balancing funding into three capability areas required for effective operations: Platforms, Access and Capabilities. 

OCPL provides cyber warfare capabilities to the 24th Air Force in direct support of US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agencies. In accordance with AF Policy, the program office develops capabilities in the cyberspace superiority core areas.  OCPL efforts also directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), the USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest AF Space Command (AFSPC) Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents. Planned areas of development, prototyping, and technology demonstration will be used to provide warfighters access, platforms, and tools. This includes mission planning, intelligence, cybersecurity products and services and Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA) tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), Command and Control systems, and create cyber effects through the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).  These advancements will be used to develop and deliver AF unique access and cutting-edge technologies to the warfighter. This capability area leverages cyber technology investments by DoD Agencies. Many program activities are protected under AF Network Warfare Special Access (SA) Programs.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Offensive Cyberspace Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Offensive Cyberspace Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a new Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations (AF DCO) provides defensive cyber capabilities that protect the AFNET and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and/or destruction. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.  

Firestarter utilizes cyber and Information Assurance (IA) technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Command's Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.

AF Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) supports the AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with 3600 funding, can be taken to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capability to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities.  AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.
 
Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

These programs are in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides newly improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from Cyber-attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements.

Firestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Space Command's Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 24th AF, as AF component to Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide Information Assurance (IA) &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY17, BA07 PE 0208088F, project 677821, Defensive Next Generation Development, was a new start.

This requirement supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment / Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess(F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, E-mail Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), Web Risk Assessment (WRA), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA). CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations. CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with 3600 funding, take them to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capabilities to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

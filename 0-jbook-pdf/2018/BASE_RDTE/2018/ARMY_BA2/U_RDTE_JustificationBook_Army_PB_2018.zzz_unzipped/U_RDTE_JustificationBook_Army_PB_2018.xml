                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, investigates, evaluates, and characterizes advanced sensor components, signal processing, and information fusion algorithms that will provide the future Soldier decisive new capabilities to locate, identify, and make decisions about and engage battlefield targets in tactical environments.  The ultimate impact and utility of this work will be to greatly increase the lethality, range, and speed of engagement of the Soldier.  Emphasis is on solving critical Army-specific battlefield sensing and information management problems, such as false targets, complex terrain (including urban applications), movement of sensors on military vehicles, and exploitation of multimodal sensors.  Significant areas of research include low-cost networked sensors for force protection, hostile fire defeat, homeland defense, counter terrorism operations, munitions, and fusion of disparate sensors (e.g., acoustic, seismic, electric-field (E-field), magnetic field) to passively detect, classify, and track battlefield targets such as personnel, heavy/light vehicles, and helicopters.  Other areas of research include sensing technologies for tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL) non-traditional targets and the location of direct and indirect fires and other hostile threats.  Further areas of research include ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronics for battlefield sensors, networked compact radar for vehicle and dismount identification and tracking; ultra-wideband radar for buried and concealed threat detection, enhanced robotic mobility, stand-off characterization of infrastructure, and the detection, classification, and tracking of humans in urban terrain.  Additional areas of research are aided/automatic target recognition (ATR), advanced battlefield sensor and information processing to conduct a dynamic and real time situational assessment to present a common picture of the battlespace focused on low echelon commanders; protection of sensors, especially human eyes, from battlefield laser threats; and advanced computational methods to provide automatic information technologies from widely dispersed sensor and legacy information sources for improved situational awareness.

This Project supports Army Science and Technology efforts in the Command Control and Communications, Ground, and Soldier portfolios. The sensor-related work in this Project complements efforts funded in Program Element (PE) 0601104A (University and Industry Research Centers), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0603710A (Night Vision Advanced Technologies), and PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology).

This research utilizes a combination of technologies based on the nature of the different threats, as well as the fundamental differences in sensors operating over different frequency ranges. Passive organic and inorganic optical limiter materials that block specific frequency bands of light will be investigated and developed for the visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and active man-made material-based solutions will be investigated for uncooled sensors in the long-wave IR (LWIR). Vulnerability of sensors and optical sensor systems will be studied against high-power and ultrashort pulsed laser threats to determine protection requirements.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) designs and validates electronic warfare (EW) components, both hardware and software, that deny, disrupt, or degrade the enemy's use of the electromagnetic spectrum for offensive or defensive operations. This is accomplished through the investigation of electronic support measures (ESM); countermeasures against communications systems and networks; the design and fabrication of sensors used to identify and locate threat forces in an asymmetric environment; and threat warning and electronic countermeasures (ECM) against munitions sensors, missile guidance systems, targeting systems, and explosive hazards. Project 906 supports protection of high-value ground platforms, aircraft and the Soldier from threat surveillance and tracking systems, imaging systems, and advanced radio frequency (RF)/electro-optical (EO)/infrared (IR) guided missiles, artillery, and smart munitions. Information fusion research addresses sensor correlation and fusion, relationship discovery, and management services through use of automated processing, as well as software that applies higher level reasoning techniques to support automated combat assessment. Project 906 also supports research and application of key EW sensors, direction finders and jammers to intercept, locate, and disrupt current and emerging communications and non-communications threat emitters to provide vital quality combat information directly to users in a timely and actionable manner. It focuses on detection of threat sensors and emitters associated with weapon systems, targeting systems and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence systems and networks.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs, fabricates, evaluates, and applies key electronic warfare (EW)/information operations technologies to enhance platform survivability (to include ground combat vehicles, aircraft, and the dismounted Soldier) and to intercept, track and locate current and emerging threat munitions, communications and non-communications threat emitters. This project applies recent advances in radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), and electro-optical (EO) sensors and jamming sources to detect, locate, deceive, and jam threats (to include radar directed target acquisition systems, target-tracking sensors, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), air-to-air missiles (AAMs), top attack weapons, and electronically fuzed munitions). This project also pursues the ability to neutralize improvised explosive devices. This project designs information systems to provide vital, quality combat information directly to users in a timely, actionable manner in accordance with concepts for future force intelligence operations. This Project investigates RF collection and mapping technologies to offer real time emitter detection, location, and identification. In addition, this project enables a remote capability to disrupt, deny, or destroy threat communication signals and enables fusion (automated assimilation and synthesis) of battlefield intelligence data to enable interpretation of current threats and future enemy activities. This allows commanders to develop operational courses of action in time to act decisively and in a pre-emptive manner.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and evaluates materials and technologies, and designs and develops methodologies and models required to enable enhanced lethality and survivability.  Project H80 focuses on applied research of lightweight armors and protective structures for the Soldier and vehicles; kinetic energy active protection; crew and components protection from ballistic shock and mine-blast; insensitive propellants/munitions formulations; novel multi-function warhead concepts; affordable precision munitions design; and techniques, methodologies, and models to analyze combat effectiveness, and identify vulnerabilities of current and emerging technologies; and developing a demonstrator with associated methods and tools for injury prediction of vehicle occupants during under-body blast events.      

Work in this PE makes extensive use of high performance computing and experimental validation and builds on research transitioned from PE 0601102A (Defense Research Sciences)/Project H42 (Materials and Mechanics) and Project H43 (Ballistics); and utilizes emerging materials from PE 0602105A (Materials Technology) and applies it to specific Army platforms and the individual Soldier applications.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the research, development, and evaluation of high-power electronic components, materials, and related technologies. These technologies have application in compact and efficient power conversion, conditioning, and management sub-systems; energy storage and conversion devices; radio frequency (RF)/microwave and solid-state laser directed energy weapons (DEW); traditional and non-traditional RF and laser electronic attack; and RF photonics. All project elements are coordinated with and, as appropriate, leveraged by DEW and power/energy programs in the Air Force, Navy, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, national labs, university consortia, and relevant industry and foreign partners. The products of this research are required by developers of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) systems to evolve traditional (mechanical-based) sub-systems such as geared transmissions, plate armor, and kinetic projectiles to electrically-based ones. These products will provide the Soldier enhanced survivability and lethality through increased power management and energy savings as well as new fighting capabilities offered only by electrical power.

This Project sustains Army science and technology efforts supporting the Ground Maneuver, Lethality and Soldier portfolios.

The work in this Project is coordinated with the Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC); Armaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC); the Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC); and the Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC).  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Adelphi, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The objective is to improve the underlying energy efficiency of supply and demand for soldier-portable and unattended sensor electronics to enable the dismounted Soldier to maintain communications, freedom of movement, and increase mission duration. The majority of the electronics power used by the dismounted soldier and by unattended sensors is attributable to RF communications. In addition, freedom of movement and action during sustained and high tempo operations requires seamless battery recharging. To address these challenges, energy efficient electronics research includes RF circuits, devices, materials and wireless power distribution.  Energy efficiency improvements will be developed and investigated in support of five key sensor and electronic areas: RF component devices, passively powered components, low-power, long-lived sources, wireless power transfer, and advanced battery chemistries. Additionally, materials and devices used for photonic applications, such as laser diodes and fiber lasers, will be studied and improved with an emphasis on overall size, weight, and power consumption efficiency gains.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research and develops component technologies that enable improved Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Target Acquisition (RSTA) and situational understanding (SU) at an affordable price. Technologies include novel focal plane arrays (FPAs), lasers, processing, and electronics. It also includes modeling and simulation to predict performance and to determine operational effectiveness of these technologies. Research focuses on infrared (IR) FPAs necessary to search, identify and track targets in all day/night visibility and battlefield conditions and to improve standoff detection in all operational environments. This Project designs, fabricates and validates large format IR FPAs for sensors to simultaneously provide wide area viewing and the high resolution imagery for situational understanding, persistent surveillance and hostile fire detection. This Project investigates and designs novel sensor electronics such as Digital Read Out Integrated Circuit (DROICs) to enable multifunction sensing. This Project also investigates and improves new semiconductor materials formed by a combination of elements from the periodic table. In addition, this Project develops algorithms for enhanced IR functionality, which provide the ability to perform detection and identification at extended ranges, as well as the ability to detect deeply buried targets. The reduction of size, weight and power (SWaP) is a key research objective for all efforts

Emphasis is on increased coverage area, higher detection rates and increased discrimination probabilities. Technologies that provide low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) solutions are considered and studied to ensure solutions are viable for Soldier-portable applications. This effort also investigates advanced signal processing and detection algorithms for increased real-time feedback for threat detection and identification, and it collects data to inform studies investigating methods to reduce the operator's cognitive burden.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied research on human factors to maximize the effectiveness of Soldiers in concert with their equipment. The resulting data are the basis for weapon systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training as well as manpower requirements to improve equipment operation and maintenance. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allows the Soldier to extract the maximum performance from the equipment.  

Major efforts research sources of stress, potential stress moderators, and intervention methods, and identify and quantify human performance measures and methods to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, enhance and validate human performance modeling tools; investigate integration of advanced concepts in crew stations designs, optimizes interfaces for information systems and improves human robot interaction (HRI) in a full mission context.

Efforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier/Squad portfolio.

Results of these efforts are transitioned to the Research, Development, and Engineering Centers, the Program Executive Offices (PEO) &amp; Program Managers, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research on human factors to maximize the effectiveness of Soldiers in concert with their equipment.  The resulting data are the basis for weapon systems and equipment design standards, guidelines, handbooks, and Soldier training as well as manpower requirements to improve equipment operation and maintenance. Application of this research will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allows the Soldier to extract the maximum performance from the equipment.  

Major efforts research sources of stress, potential stress moderators, and intervention methods, and identify and quantify human performance measures and methods to address current and future warrior performance issues. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, enhance and validate human performance modeling tools; investigate integration of advanced concepts in crew stations designs, optimizes interfaces for information systems and improves human robot interaction (HRI) in a full mission context.

Efforts in this Project support the Army Science and Technology Soldier/Squad portfolio.

Results of these efforts are transitioned to the Research, Development, and Engineering Centers, the Program Executive Offices (PEO) &amp; Program Managers, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC).

When demands cannot be remediated by human systems integration, training may enable the demands to be met.  This effort will identify human operator tasks in complex, intelligent, and emerging systems critical to mission employment of new technologies.  The aspects (particularly knowledge and skill) of those tasks will be determined through experimentation and analysis to inform development of training and simulation technologies, fundamental research on the effectiveness of training regimes, and simultaneous task combinations that must be trained.

                                <r2:Description>Soldier performance is affected by mission demands, environment, human characteristics, equipment, and technology.  System development requires considering tradeoffs among these factors and sufficient data about them on which to base analyses. This effort will identify and develop human performance measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) critical to performing individual and team tasks in a mission text. Tools and techniques for analysis of these tradeoffs will also be developed. Empirical data will be mined from existing sources or collected where gaps exist to inform the interaction among factors affecting Soldier mission performance for emerging technologies. This research supports the development of the SSEA and is coordinated with PE 0602786A/H98, 0603015A/S28, PE 0603710A/Project K70, PE 0602308A/ C90, PE 0602787A/869, and 0603004A/232.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and evaluates enabling tools and methodologies that support the long-term sustainment of Army training and testing activities. Specific focus is on maintaining regulatory compliance while limiting future Army liability to installation operations and training, and maintaining resilient and adaptive ranges. Project 048 improves the Army's ability to comply with requirements mandated by federal, state and local environmental/health laws and to reduce the cost of this compliance. Project 835 develops enabling technologies for advanced life cycle analysis, advanced sensing, and advanced remediation of Army-unique hazardous and toxic wastes at sites containing waste ammunition, explosives, heavy metals, propellants, smokes, chemical munitions, and other organic contaminants. Project 895 focuses on reducing hazardous waste generation through process modification and control, materials recycling and substitution, and developing technologies to predict and mitigate range and maneuver constraints associated with current and emerging weapon systems, doctrine, and regulations. Project 896 investigates technologies for ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, monitoring, modeling, and mitigation to support sustainable use of Army lands and airspace to reduce or eliminate environmental constraints to military missions.   

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment.  

Technologies developed in this PE are transitioned to PE 0603728A (Environmental Quality Technology Demonstrations).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project designs and develops tools and methods to enable the Army to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts both in the United States and abroad. These new and innovative technologies are essential for the effective control and reduction of military unique hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on military installations and associated with contingency operations bases worldwide. To develop the required technologies, this Project has a focus on developing sustainable environmental protection technologies that help the Army maintain environmental compliance for sources of pollution such as production facilities, facility contamination, and other waste streams; a focus on Army-unique ecosystem vulnerability assessment, and ecosystem analysis, modeling, adaptation, and mitigation technologies for installations associated with air quality and endangered species management and their impacts on training and testing missions; a focus on designing and developing technologies for deployed forces with environmentally safe, operationally enhanced, and cost effective technologies or processes to achieve maximum diversion, minimization, or volume reduction of base camp and field waste; and a focus on the impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. The resultant technologies reduce the impact of legal and regulatory environmental restrictions on installation facilities, training and testing lands and ranges, as well as provide a means to avoid fines and facility shutdowns within the United States and reduce environmental impacts to the Warfighter abroad.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates a quantitative means to determine the environmental effects resulting from exposure to Army-unique explosives, propellants, smokes, and products containing nanomaterials and new and emerging compounds and materials across Army training and operations. This research provides the basis for tools and methods to respond to regulatory constraints, and to protect the health of the Soldier and the extended Army community. Results of this research will be integrated into the life cycle analysis of all new Army materials and chemicals. The specific results of this research include: determination of acceptable contaminant concentration levels for residual Army-unique chemicals and materials of concern to minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. This includes development of methods that guide the design of nanomaterials and other new and emerging materials such that adverse effects on the environment are minimized in their designed state and when they enter the environment where they may break down. Example areas of research include genomics analysis, cutting edge nanomaterial analysis, and computational/molecular modeling. Interim products are used by Program Executive Office (PEO) Ammo and PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (IEW&amp;S) for use in life cycle analysis, risk assessment, and cleanup. Interim products are also US Environmental Protection Agency approved criteria documents to be used in risk assessment procedures and in establishing regulatory limits. The Army uses these criteria during negotiations with regulatory officials to set scientifically and economically appropriate cleanup and discharge limits on Army lands.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Project develops pollution prevention technologies required to reduce/eliminate the environmental footprint resulting from the manufacture, maintenance, use and surveillance of Army ordnance and other weapon systems. This Project researches and develops revolutionary technologies to eliminate or significantly reduce the environmental impacts that threaten the sustainment of production and maintenance facilities, training ranges and operational areas. The Project supports the transformation of the Army by ensuring that advanced energetic materials required for high-performance munitions (gun, rocket, missile propulsion systems, and warhead explosives) are devised to meet weapons lethality/survivability stretch goals in parallel with, and in compliance to, foreseeable sustainment requirements. Specific technology thrusts include environmentally-benign explosives developed with computer modeling using Department of Defense high-performance computing resources; novel energetics that capitalize on the unique behavior of nano-scale structures; chemically engineered explosive and propellant formulations produced with minimal environmental waste, long-storage lifetime, rapid/benign environmental degradation properties, and efficient extraction and reuse; and fuses, pyrotechnics, and initiators that are free from toxic chemicals. Other focus areas include toxic metal reductions from surface finishing processes, sustainable military paints and coatings to meet evolving environmental requirements and low global warming potential alternatives for refrigerants, fire suppressants and solvents. 

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and applies advanced communications and network devices, software, algorithms and services by leveraging and adapting commercial research and new communications and network sciences work by the Army Research Lab, Network Science Collaborative Technology Alliance or other Basic Research efforts. This Project leverages developments in wireless transport (e.g. mobile radio based communications systems) to design new techniques for improving communications in high radio frequency (RF) interference environments, such as in the presence of electronic warfare (EW), and to increase the communications capacity of terrestrial and satellite communications (SATCOM) systems. This Project also investigates antenna components, materials, designs and configurations to reduce the visual signature of antennas on Soldier, vehicular and airborne platforms and to reduce co-site interference on platforms with multiple transceivers, such as radios and jammers. Additionally, this Project investigates cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA), cyber security devices, software and techniques to harden wireless communications networks against cyber attacks and new mobile networking protocols to make wireless, on-the-move (OTM) communications networks more responsive to user needs. This Project also investigates software and techniques that improve the ability of the Soldier to manage and maintain complex, dynamic networks; and it design and develops spectrum management software tools to make more efficient use of the congested RF spectrum. This Project also provides new capabilities to lower the size, weight, power and cost of networking systems deployed on Army platforms.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) investigates and advances technologies, techniques, and tools for representation of the physical and human environment for use in military planning and operations; for characterizing geospatial, atmospheric, and weather conditions and impacts on systems and military missions; for conducting mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and force protection planning and operations; and for enabling secure, sustainable, energy efficient facilities. Research focuses on special requirements for battlefield visualization, tactical decision aids, weather intelligence products, and capabilities to exploit space assets. Project 855 conducts geospatial research and development supporting a standard sharable geospatial foundation enabling a common operating environment across mission and command systems. Project H71 supports the materiel development, testing, and operations communities in evaluating the impacts of weather and atmospheric obscurants on military materiel and operations. Project T40 advances force protection technologies across the range of military operations, including expedient protection and hardened construction to defeat complex threats. This Project also designs and evaluates software and hardware to identify and mitigate ground obstacles for manned and unmanned vehicles; characterizes austere navigation environments, including complex urban environments, and designs and evaluates materiel solutions, including rapidly emplace bridging and expedient repair technologies, to allow austere port and airfield entry of forces; and builds and uses modeling and simulation tools to advance understanding of the interactions of weapons/munitions and novel defeat methodologies with buildings, shelters, bunkers, berms, and bridges. Project T41 investigates application of technologies to enable garrison/post commanders to plan, monitor, and operate facilities more efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and sustainably; creates tools (including advanced models and simulations) that provide a framework for making trades and decisions; and supports research to evaluate non-combat population characteristics and status from social and cultural perspectives to achieve mission objectives. Project T42 develops and validates models and simulations to understand the impacts of the physical environment on the performance of forces, ground and air vehicles, and sensors; as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on military operations. Project T45 investigates and evaluates materials, components, and systems that have potential to reduce energy losses in buildings and shelters; and potential to detect and mitigate consequences of contaminants, such as bacteria and molds, in air handling equipment and building materials.

Efforts include high-resolution, local assessments and forecasts of meteorological conditions in near real time including effects of urban and mountainous terrain; analytical tools to assess the impact of the atmosphere to optimize system performance and operations planning and advanced atmospheric sensing applications to characterize and mitigate wind and turbulence in complex terrain. It provides detailed model applications for various effects of the atmosphere on electro-optical and acoustic target detection, location, and identification. This Project develops both physics-based decision aids and rule-based decision support systems for assessing the impacts of weather/atmosphere across a spectrum of friendly and threat weapons systems, sensors, platforms, and operations. Information can be applied to mission planning and execution, battlefield visualization, reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition, route planning to maximize stealth and efficiency, web enabled tactical decision aids, and also modeling of environmental impacts for combat simulations and war games.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates, evaluates, and develops technologies for adaptive and expedient force protection across the range of military operations. Focus areas include force projection and maneuver, including austere port and airfield entry; prediction, definition, avoidance, or defeat of natural and manmade gaps and obstacles; scalable weapons effects; and high-resolution representation of near-surface terrain and environment for use with sensor models for target detection and unmanned ground systems (UGS) navigation. This research also provides physics-based representations of ground vehicle mobility, obstacle and barrier placement, survivability, and weapons effects in complex and urban terrain modeling and simulation. Work in this Project increases the survivability of critical assets from conventional, unconventional, and emerging threats and enables maneuver support of deployed forces, while reducing their logistical footprint. This Project supports efforts for overcoming critical capability gaps for protecting troops operating in a number of environments, including smaller bases that are remote or integrated with local communities, and dismounted Soldiers conducting missions in urban environments.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and evaluates technologies and techniques to ensure sustainable, cost efficient, and effective facilities, and to achieve resilient and sustainable installation and base operations. The project focuses on facilities and operations technologies directly supporting training, readiness, force projection, force protection, homeland security, and forward base operations. Facility enhancement technologies contribute to cost reductions in the Army facility life cycle process (infrastructure planning, assessment, design, construction, revitalization, sustainment, and disposal), and the supporting installation operations. This work improves the ability of installations to support forces to meet transformation goals, improves designs for close battle training facilities, and enhances security of Soldiers, families, and civilians. Technologies evolving from this work include integrated planning and design tools for United States (U.S.) facilities and forward bases, models predicting water dispersed contaminant effects on facilities and occupants; sustainable facility and base management; collaborative decision support tools; and advanced materials. In addition, technologies from this work will support analysis of socio-cultural and facility issues in forward base operations, including urban environments.  

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and advances technologies to characterize and respond to impacts of the terrestrial environment on the performance of emerging and deployed Army systems, as well as the impact of natural and man-made changes in the environment on all phases of unified land operations. Research efforts model the dynamics of electromagnetic, acoustic, and seismic propagation in response to changing terrain state and complex terrain features and geometry, and their depiction in geospatial information and mission command systems. Numerical modeling of weather effects on terrain properties supports intelligence preparation of the battlefield products, including mobility estimates and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance planning. This effort integrates terrain knowledge and weather forecast in a mission context to provide geospatial information and mission command-delivered solutions to the Soldier. The understanding gained and products developed improve the ability to predict signature (emitter) behavior and sensor performance in complex operational environments, and support materiel development, sensor performance products for tactical decision-making, and visualization for mission command.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) conducts applied behavioral and social science research to enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective training and mentoring methods to ensure Soldiers, leaders, and units have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to sustain positive unit climates and meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, refines performance metrics, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs.  Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Efforts in this PE support the Army Science and Technology Soldier portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Human Capital Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Ft. Belvoir, VA.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 and 2016 Project 874 funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. In FY17 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts will be funded in Project ET4. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be merged into Project 869. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from Project VB4 to Project 869.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports application of knowledge gained through basic research to refine drugs, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics, medical practices/ procedures, and other preventive measures essential to the protection and sustainment of Warfighter health. Research is conducted in five principal areas: Combat Casualty Care; Military Operational Medicine; Military Relevant Infectious Diseases Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine; and Systems Biology/Network Sciences.

Research is funded in six projects.

Project 869 refines knowledge and technologies on screening tools and preventive measures for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injuries, physiological monitors, and interventions to protect Warfighter's from injuries resulting from operational stress, and exposure to hazardous environments and materials. Also conducts research on medically valid testing devices (i.e. the test mannequins that are true to the human form and physiologically and anatomically accurate) and predictive models used for the refinement of Warfighter protective equipment. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. Starting in FY17 the FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into this project. Additionally, starting in FY17 the toxic substances research efforts will move from project VB4 to project 869.

Project 870 designs and refines drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic assays/tests devices, other preventive measures for protection and treatment against naturally occurring infectious diseases as identified by worldwide medical surveillance and military threat analysis. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project 874 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics (medical products derived from living organisms), medical devices, and diagnostics for field trauma care systems, resuscitation, and life support, and post-evacuation restorative and rehabilitative care. Focus is identifying more effective critical care technologies and clinical practice guidelines to treat severe bleeding, traumatic brain injury, burns and other combat related traumatic injuries, and treatments for ocular (eye) injury and visual system dysfunction. Additional focus areas are laboratory and animal studies of regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissue for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program. In FY15 and 16 this Project funds both Combat Casualty Care and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine efforts. Starting in FY17 the funding for Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from Project 874 to Project ET4.

Project ET4, which is a restructure of efforts funded elsewhere in this Program Element, starts in FY17 and the funding for the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program moves from Project 874 to Project ET4. Project ET4 identifies and evaluates drugs, biologics, medical devices, treatments and diagnostics for post- evacuation restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative care, as well as systems for use by field medics and surgeons for ocular trauma. Research focus is on identifying more effective technologies and protocols to treat ocular injury and visual system dysfunction, as well as laboratory and animal studies for regenerating skin, muscle, nerves, vascular and bone tissues for the care and treatment of wounded Service Members. This Project is being coordinated with the Defense Health Program.

Project FH2 conducts applied research focused on sustainment of a healthy Warfighters throughout the entire deployment life cycle. Starting in FY17, Project FH2 funding and research will be consolidated into Project 869.

Project VB4 includes applied research in systems biology to provide a highly effective mechanism to integrate biological tests and computer simulations in clinical trials and in animal studies. The PTSD and Coagulopathy exemplars have demonstrated the power of an iterative systems biology approach and are moving projects related to objective diagnostics and improved and personalized therapeutic strategies. Development of the SysBioCube (a data analysis, management and integration system) has provided the ability for complex collaborative efforts to share, process and evaluate data using innovative technologies. These concerted refinement efforts using systems biology are showing reduction of time and funding for solutions to intractable problems of critical military importance. Starting in FY17 the toxic substances efforts will move from Project VB4 to Project 869.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

All medical applied research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The FDA requires thorough testing in animals (preclinical testing) to ensure safety and, where possible, effectiveness prior to evaluation in controlled human clinical trials (upon transition to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development). This PE focuses on research and refinement of technologies such as product formulation and purification and laboratory test refinement with the aim of identifying candidate solutions. This work often involves testing in animal models. The EPA also requires thorough testing of products, such as sterilants, disinfectants, repellents, and insecticides to ensure the environment is adequately protected before these products are licensed for use.

Program refinement and execution is externally peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defenses (DoD) biomedical research and refinement community, as well as their associated enabling research areas.
Work funded in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts undertaken in PE 0603002A (Medical Advanced Technology) and the Defense Health Program.

Work in this PE is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD and its overseas laboratories; Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR), Fort Detrick, MD; Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), Natick, MA; the Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Joint Base San Antonio, TX; Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), Fort Rucker, AL; and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the Drugs to Prevent/Treat Parasitic Diseases and Vaccines for Prevention of Malaria research areas are merged into Applied Research on drugs and vaccines against parasitic diseases.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project conducts applied research for medical countermeasures to naturally occurring infectious diseases that pose a significant threat to the operational effectiveness of forces deployed outside the United States. Effective preventive countermeasures (protective/therapeutic drugs and vaccines and insect repellents and traps) protect the Force from disease and sustain operations by avoiding the need for evacuations from the theater of operations. Diseases of military importance are malaria, bacterial diarrhea, and viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever and hantavirus). In addition to countermeasures, this project funds refinement of improved diagnostic tools to facilitate early identification of infectious disease threats in an operational environment, informing Commanders of the need to institute preventive actions and improve medical care. Major goals are to integrate genomics (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based) and proteomics (protein-based) as well as other new biotechnologies into the refinement of new concepts for new vaccine, drug, and diagnostics candidates.

Research conducted in this project focuses on the following four areas:

(1) Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organisms living in or on another organisms) Diseases
(2) Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3) Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4) Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control
 
For the refinement of drugs and biological products, studies in the laboratory and in animal models provide a proof-of-concept for these candidate products, including safety, toxicity (degree to which a substance can damage an organism), and effectiveness, and are necessary to provide evidence to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to justify approval for a product to enter into future human subject testing. Additional non-clinical studies are often needed in applied research even after candidate products enter into human testing during advanced technology development, usually at the direction of the FDA, to assess potential safety issues. Drug and vaccine refinement bears high technical risk. Of those candidates identified as promising in initial screens, the vast majority are eliminated after additional safety, toxicity, and/or effectiveness testing. Similarly, vaccine candidates have a high failure rate, because animal testing may not be a good predictor of human response, and therefore candidate technologies/products are often eliminated after going into human trials. Because of this high failure rate, a continuing effort to identify other potential candidates to sustain a working pipeline of countermeasures is critical for replacing those products that fail in testing.  

Work is managed by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.   

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this project are further matured under PE 0603002A, Project 810.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.   
 
Work in this Project is performed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories; the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD; and the NMRC, Silver Spring, MD, and its overseas laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine funding will move to Project ET4.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project refines and assesses concepts, techniques, and materiel that improve survivability and ensure improved treatment outcomes for Warfighters wounded in combat and other military operations. Combat casualty care research addresses control of severe bleeding, resuscitation and stabilization, predictive indicators and decision support technologies for life support systems , treatment of burns, and traumatic injuries to hard and soft tissues of the face, mouth, and extremities and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical and rehabilitative medicine research addresses tissue repair and functional restoration including transplant technologies, for injuries to or loss of bone, muscle, skin, organ, nerve and eyes.

Research involves extensive collaboration with multiple academic institutions to refine treatments for combat wounds through Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM). This project is coordinated with the Military Departments and other government organizations to avoid duplication.
Research conducted in this project focuses on the following five areas:

(1)	Damage Control Resuscitation
(2)	Combat Trauma Therapies
(3)	Combat Critical Care Engineering
(4)	Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine (moves to ET4 in FY17)
(5)	Traumatic Brain Injury

All drugs, biological products, and medical devices are refined in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, which govern testing in animals to assess safety, toxicity, and effectiveness and subsequent human subject clinical trials.  Promising efforts identified in this Project are further matured under Program Element (PE) 0603002A, Project 840.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology, focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work on this project is performed by United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD; and the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), at multiple institutions across the US.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports biological and clinical applied research using the data analysis and integration grid (SysBioCube) as an overarching means of complex data usage to solve critical health problems. The primary capability of systems biology (field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach) is the integration and analysis of complex human and animal study data and development of computational disease models, using global multi- omic methods to identify and discriminate unique combinations of biological molecules corresponding to clinical conditions (physiologic, immunologic, endocrine, etc.), supporting transition of research to clinical applications. This capability applies a systematic integrated approach to trace progression of illnesses and diseases and has already shown that the approach significantly reduces time, funds and effort invested in medical product development and refinement as seen in biomarker development for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and enhanced analyses of coagulopathy. Another application of systems biology is to characterize physiological pathways altered by toxic substances enabling identification of the causative toxic substances as well as to understand the injury mechanisms. The detection/identification of physiological markers of exposure to toxic substances can then be used to support medical countermeasure decisions or development of targeted therapeutic drugs.

These examples of more complex, yet integrated approaches to Projects studying biological systems (PTSD) Project) have been shown to reduce both the time and expense of medical product development for the Army

Applied research is being conducted to identify biological networks that are causative of illness in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and co-morbidities (presence of one or more diseases or disorders), coagulopathy (impaired ability to clot blood) of trauma, Traumatic Brain Injury, pain, suicide, infectious disease, and immune responses. In particular, the studies of PTSD are directed to refine biomarkers for screening, early diagnosis and therapeutic target discovery. Applied research is also aimed to identify  (the substance itself and how it causes harm) toxic substances, e.g., toxic industrial chemicals. The molecular and physiological markers of intoxication are then applied to support diagnostic tools development of medical countermeasures.

Will oversee data sharing and data integration of large, complex datasets. Will increase capabilities to develop novel methods that integrate different systems biology data (e.g., genetics and metabolism data) that, in turn, will lead to new knowledge products.  Will provide support to the Integrative Systems Biology Program at USACEHR for oversight of research efforts. Time-dependent clinical data collections and integrated omics analyses of treatment efficacies will be used in a wide range of studies including biomarker development and the understanding the altered molecular mechanisms that underlie PTSD, coagulopathy (blood’s ability to form clot is impaired), chronic pain perception, infectious diseases, and micro-gravitational stress on bone.  Will build a data-repository capability within the SysBioCube that will initially be for publications and associated datasets from 6.1 (Basic Research)-funded intramural research.</r2:Text>

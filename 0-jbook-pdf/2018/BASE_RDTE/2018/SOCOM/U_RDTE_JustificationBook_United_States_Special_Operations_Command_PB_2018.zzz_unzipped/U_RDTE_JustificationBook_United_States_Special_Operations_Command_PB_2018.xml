            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.  Sub-projects within the SOF Technology Demonstration effort include:

•  SOF Technology Development Sub-Project:  This project conducts studies and develops laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology developments, and leverages other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.

•  Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Sub-Project:  TTL funds Applied Research projects identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL applies leading edge nanotechnology, biometric and biotechnology, and chemistry which is directed towards the development of revolutionary tags, taggants, sensors, communications, and data processing.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for rapid prototyping, Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations.  It is a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in operationally relevant environments with Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  This project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results often facilitate the initiation of new programs and the insertion of appropriate technologies to acquisition programs.   The element also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few rapid prototypes must be developed on a responsive basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate prototyping efforts of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  Sub-projects within the SOF Special Technology Development efforts include:  

  •  Special Operations Forces Special Technology Sub-Project.  This sub-project integrates emerging technologies and presents them in technology demonstrations, in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.

  • Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technologies Sub-Project.  TTL funds SOF unique ATDs identified in the USSOCOM Quick Look Capabilities Based Assessments (QL-CBA).  TTL rapidly prototypes and expeditiously transitions projects from laboratory to acquisition Programs of Record/operational use to address SOF capability deficiencies.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project conducts rapid prototyping of information and broadcast system technology.  Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.  

Broadcast and Dissemination Modernization.  Develops emerging technologies available in the marketplace to transform and modernize planning, analysis, development, broadcast, distribution, dissemination, and feedback capabilities for MISO forces. This initiative will also continue development of appropriate emerging technologies initially identified by Advance Technology Demonstrations and Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations to transition to acquisition programs. Technologies include: multi-frequency broadcast systems; digital broadcast capabilities; remote controlled electronic paper; near-real-time command and control of unattended systems, especially in denied areas; focused/beam speaker sound technologies; visual projection technologies; advanced commercial broadcast technologies including amplitude modulation and frequency modulation radio transmitters and antenna; television transmitter and antenna systems; internet and telephony dissemination and broadcast systems; technologies capable of long-loiter broadcast and delivery in denied and permissive environment; and technologies that automate and improve planning and analytical capability through integrated capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017, this Program Element has been consolidated into SOCOM Program Element 1160434BB, Unmanned ISR.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery/signals intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

New AEW kit incorporates waterproofed hardware, multiple signal sets, and can be flown aboard a Puma I or Puma II UAS air vehicle.

•  Open System Auto-Pilot:  Successfully replaced proprietary Puma I auto-pilot with low cost, commercial, non-proprietary device; aircraft flew well with no observed anomalous flight characteristics.  Began effort to replace Scan Eagle auto-pilot with the same commercial auto-pilot used in Puma I; expected to fly in FY17.

•  Wi-Fi Exploitation Capability:  Flew down-sized space, weight and power (SWAP) LANShark© hardware in Puma I UAS.  Demonstrated initial capabilities including the ability to turn the payload off to conserve battery power.</r2:Text>

The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Joint Task Force level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighter and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighter with the essential intelligence information and provides situation awareness information to the SOF leadership at all echelons.  The four components of DCGS-SOF include the following:  The Enterprise provides infrastructure and processing capability to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing. Full Motion Video PED provides (FMV) PED capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors.  SILENT DAGGER provides Signals Intelligence exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. The All Source Information Fusion (ASIF) will provide the intelligence analytical tools via a global and disconnected architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate commercial/government off-the-shelf systems, and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which resides within the SOF Information Enterprise and enables more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of data and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements.  The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, interagency, and Coalition tactical ISR PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by an engineering development team.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition and Strike.  This project received congressional add in FY 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY2017, this Program Element has been consolidated into SOCOM Program Element 1160434BB, Unmanned ISR.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program.  Two programs are in this program element: Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) and the Multi-mission Tactical Unmanned Aerial System (MTUAS).  SUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the SUAS and related ground control stations.  MTUAS identifies, develops, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications on the MTUAS and related ground control stations.   

USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This line item addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small business concerns with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 is the first year USSOCOM is participating in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser (HEL); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.  

CV-22 Development:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project develops SOF-unique modifications and upgrades to SOF rotary wing aircraft that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:

FY 2016:  Decrease of -$6.169 million is due to a transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs.

FY 2017:  Increase of $4.400 million in Project D615, Rotary Wing Aviation is due to an FY 2017 Request for Additional Appropriations to continue research, development, test and evaluation of new and modified detection and defeat countermeasures systems to improve aircraft survivability capabilities and address emerging threats to SOF rotary wing aircraft.

FY 2018:  Increase of $103.967 million is to complete flight testing efforts for A/MH-6M aircraft Block 3.0 upgrades ($11.839 million); research, develop and evaluate new and modified detection and defeat countermeasure systems and improve SOF rotary wing aircraft survivability ($13.700 million); development, integration and test to provide EW capability against RF threats on AC/MC-130J aircraft ($15.009 million); prepare for testing of the AbMN capability of near-real-time intelligence reporting to the SOF MC-130J fleet ($0.692 million); provides for risk reduction testing of the PSP HEL weapon onto AC-130J aircraft ($15.650 million); systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP integration and test on SOF platforms ($3.000 million); supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development, qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on the MC-130J  ($44.077 million).

Schedule:  SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar Initial Operational Test and Evaluation has been delayed until 2nd Quarter FY 2017, after an interoperability assessment revealed shortcomings in flight suitability and effectiveness.   Another software version must be developed to address these shortcomings.  EC-130J SOF-Unique 7.0/8.1 development slip was due to a delay in the 7.0/8.1 Air Force modification contract.  C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar trial kit installs were delayed due to subcontractor negotiations and resulted in a slip to contract award.  No change in development start.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the investigation, evaluation, development, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements.  Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF specific avionics; low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD), terrain following/terrain avoidance (TF/TA) radar; Defensive Countermeasures (DCM) which includes Electronic Warfare – Radio Frequency Countermeasures (EW-RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); AC-130H, AC-130W, and AC-130U recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection and identification technologies; digital broadcast capability; aerial refueling; Survivability; and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF UAS ISR platforms.

• EC-130J Upgrades provides for integration of SOF-unique implementation of the C-130J block cycle upgrade as installed on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft and development of digital broadcast capabilities.

 • EC-130J Commando Solo supports development, integration and testing of digital broadcast capabilities on the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft.

• EW-RFCM supports development, integration and test activities to provide EW capability against RF threats for SOF AC/MC-130J aircraft.  The DCM suite is an integrated package of existing and future aircraft defensive systems which provides situational awareness and threat response processing; this includes the RFCM system, and future defensive systems.  RFCM program provides SOF-unique aircraft defensive capabilities required for SOF missions.

• PSP for SOF supports systems engineering, analysis, development, and enhancement of the baseline PSP and integration, installation, and test on host MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force for the AC-130H, AC-130W and AC-130U recapitalization, as well as current SOF C-130s,  AC-130Js and AC-130Ws, and other SOF platforms.  Missions for the AC-130 aircraft include, but are not limited to, Close Air Support (CAS), Air Interdiction, and Armed Reconnaissance.  PSP is modular, scalable, and platform neutral.
 
• PSP High Energy Laser (HEL) supports demonstration of HEL weapon onto AC-130 platforms.  HEL efforts include system design and evaluation of mature laser, beam director, power, and thermal subsystems.  The HEL components will be designed for modular upgrades and integrated with the PSP system.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports integration and test of a TF/TA radar and on-board processor to provide a multi-mode terrain following capability on MC-130J aircraft.  Crew systems integration efforts include modifications to aircraft controls and displays to automate TF/TA flight management and reduce pilot, copilot and Combat Systems Officer workload during missions previously performed by five aircrew members on legacy C-130 tankers and penetrators. This project received a congressional add in FY 2016.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), qualification, and operational flight testing of a SOF common TF/TA LPI/LPD radar to defeat advanced passive detection threats while maintaining ability to fly safe TF.  This radar is targeted for use on MH-47G heavy assault helicopters, MH-60M medium assault helicopters, MC-130J Commando II and CV-22 Osprey aircraft.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology supports development, integration, and testing of sensor miniaturization efforts to adapt large (Group 4-5) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR capabilities on all SOF UAS ISR platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO:  Digital broadcast capabilities are being developed through an incremental acquisition strategy to incorporate and test readily available equipment into the EC-130J aircraft.

• EW – RFCM:  Awarded competitive EMD contract for development. Down selected to the best overall solution to integrate and test an RF Countermeasures System on AC/MC-130J aircraft.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division as the government integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium broad area announcement using incremental Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts and cost sharing agreements.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls. Government developmental test and evaluation, FY 2018 - FY 2020; Operational Test and Evaluation, FY 2021 with Initial Operational Capability, Q4FY2021.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Competitive EMD contract was awarded to Raytheon in FY 2007 for radar B Kit design, development, and testing.  Subsequent MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit design, integration, and test efforts awarded to Lockheed Martin (SOFSA). Low Rate Initial Production Contract II was awarded to Raytheon in May 2016.  Follow-on platform A Kit aircraft install kits will be awarded in FY 2018 - FY 2019.  MH-47G and MH-60M A Kit production and installation will be completed at the SOFSA. A follow-on Full Rate Production Firm-Fixed-Price contract following completion of operational testing.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, such as Group 4-5 unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms, such as Group 2-3 UAS.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this program supports integration, design, development, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar program provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and tech limited terrain following/avoidance radar.

• Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.

• CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable radar to replace obsolescing and tech limited APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar was developed by USSOCOM to replace the existing, obsolescing APQ-186 TF/TA multimode radar on the CV-22.  The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SKR program is to procure APQ-187 radar units and software modifications through the USSOCOM SKR Program Management Office. Contracts will be awarded to integrate SKR into the V-22 platform and buy aircraft modification kits, using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds the definition, design, development, prototyping, integration, and testing of Mission Training and Preparation Systems (MTPS) to support training, avoid obsolescence, and maintain simulator concurrency with weapon system configurations; support mission planning and rehearsal systems enhancements required to meet Special Operations Force (SOF)-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing; and support mission planning and rehearsal capabilities in current MTPS. The MTPS project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse SOF training systems.

Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique modifications to replace aging/retired MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II, AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, and AC-130U Spooky aircraft. The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J Gunship configuration. The AC-130J aircraft perform close air support (CAS), air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.  The MC-130J aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single- or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  Additional capabilities include low-level navigation and in-flight refueling.  The Air Force will procure and field basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM. An incremental upgrade approach will be used to incorporate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.

Aviation Systems funds develop, integrate, and test aircraft enhancements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements. Enhancements include, but are not limited to, SOF communications, mission processors, aircraft performance enhancements, Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), electronic warfare and survivability systems, and other SOF mission kits. Provides PSP aircraft infrastructure development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops/upgrades Special Operation Forces (SOF) rotary wing aircraft systems that operate in increasingly hostile environments.  This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) and weapons systems to counter rapidly merging threats, improved lethality and enhanced aircraft self-protection. Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: A/MH-6M, MH-60M, and MH-47G.  These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in world-wide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts and they must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operating at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  Sub-projects include:  

•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade is necessary to restore structural, performance, and safety margins for the aircrews.  An airframe structural modification and/or airframe replacement will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations, and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement efforts will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components to the extent possible and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrews and customers necessary to support time sensitive mission requirements.  This upgrade is critical in keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational through FY 2020 and beyond or until a suitable replacement aircraft is available.  The non-recurring effort supports development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data items to support issuance of Government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.

•  MH-60M Modification and Upgrades develops technologies to improve safety of the MH-60 and decrease operational costs. Efforts include, but are not limited to, DOD MH-60 engineering changes, product improvements to SOF unique equipment and munitions during testing. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades provides the development, integration, and qualification efforts on the MH-60 helicopter to include flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation. 

•  Degraded Visual Environment (DVE) solution will fuse information from currently fielded aircraft sensors with emerging technology to display real-time reference points, obstacles, and landing zone information to the aircrew.  The DVE solution will provide MH-47/60 aircrews with visual cues for obstacle avoidance and aircraft control during all phases of flight and significantly increase crew and passenger survivability in Degraded Visual Environments. This program addresses SOF-unique requirements for rapid fielding and weight limitations, capitalizes on the unique skills of the SOF aviator while integrating with SOF-unique avionics, and leverages existing sensors on SOF aircraft to the maximum extent possible.

 •  Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program provides for the long-term replacement of an aging fleet of aircraft and provides a significant increase in range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and maintainability of vertical lift aircraft to meet emerging mission requirements.  USSOCOM will participate in the service-common development of a joint future vertical lift aircraft by injecting USSOCOM requirements and equities into the initial development and design efforts to minimize SOF-unique modifications to the common aircraft.

•  Infrared Countermeasure (IRCM) program provides a low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) capability suitable for the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird with potential use on the MH-60 and MH-47 aircraft. The IRCM program will integrate and test a complete lightweight IRCM system to include a missile warning system and countermeasure capability and infrared suppressor. The A/MH-6 is the only tactical aircraft in the SOF inventory without protection from infrared guided and other advanced Man Portable Air Defense missiles.

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades program develops technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, the Active Parallel Actuator System (APAS) and Engine Barrier Filter. This sub-project also includes modifications to ASE and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats and enhance aircraft self-protection.

•  Mission Processor Upgrade (MPU) program provides for non-recurring engineering (NRE), systems engineering/testing, and future aircraft architecture studies that support the replacement and upgrade of the current mission and video processors for all Army Special Operations Aviation (ARSOA).  Upgrading all internal processors increases the processing power to support critical functionality and emerging technologies that will be integrated into the Common Avionics Architecture System.  This MPU provides the processing and memory resources required to incorporate the following functions into the General Purpose Processing Unit: (1) Global Air Traffic Management replaces ground-based navigation aids with a capability that meets the international requirement that all aircraft be compliant with digital and space-based navigation systems; (2) Situational Awareness for Safe Aircraft Recovery provides passive survivability for flight operations in all weather conditions by providing three-dimensional displays with flight path guidance to increase battle space awareness in zero-visibility conditions; (3) Cognitive Decision Aiding System fuses information on threat, route, weather, terrain, and friendly forces instantaneously adjusting an aircraft’s route to protect the flight crew in hazardous weather, low levels, and night conditions.

•  Next Generation Forward Looking Infrared (NGFLIR) program improves targeting, tracking, and aircrew situational awareness on ARSOA platforms. This program mitigates obsolescence and increases functionality on the light and heavy assault platforms within the ARSOA fleet.

•  The Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Upgrades program develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-unique aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced Surface-to-Air (SA) threat systems for the A/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  Additionally, these threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.

•  Secure Real Time Video (SRTV) ensures that while en route to an objective, SOF aircrews and operators have access to the latest data collected on the objective enabling them to maintain situational awareness and improve survivability.  This project will integrate and test software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three major efforts:  airframe/rotors, engine control, and cockpit.  The airframe/rotors development effort will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframe.  The engine control work will be performed by Rolls-Royce and Triumph Electronic Control Systems under sole-source contract to Rolls Royce.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item (NDI)/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on the prototype MH-60M helicopter.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.

•  MH-60M Block Upgrades are accomplished for 72 MH-60M base aircraft with various contractors and acquisition vehicles.  The SOFSA executes SOF-unique upgrade modifications onto the MH-60M base aircraft. 

•  DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in degraded visual environments.  A competitive source selection process was conducted for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and heads up display of visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

•  FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years.   

•  IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Naval Research Lab IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The Government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.   

•  MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications mostly consist of Government executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

•  MPU - Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Modernization NRE will be used to improve analog-to-digital signal processing and reliability, as well as reduce weight.  The DCU efforts will be sole-source to Sanmina SCI Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the DCU.  The Future Aircraft Architecture Studies will be competitively awarded.

•  NGFLIR utilizes the Common Sensor Payload, an existing Army program of record, as a life-cycle replacement for the Q2V2 EOSS.  This effort mainly consists of upgrading the camera from Standard Definition to High Definition utilizing existing Army contracts with the OEM.  SOF-unique integration on the MH-60M DAP platforms will be accomplished through existing aircraft modification contracts.

•  The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the original equipment manufacturer.

•  The SRTV project integrates and tests software and hardware improvements to provide SOF helicopters with access to rapidly evolving, real-time full motion video intelligence.  A variety of contracting methods will be used for acquiring test assets, accomplishing SOF-unique modifications and testing to include use of other services’ contracts, competition, sole source awards, and directed efforts of government organizations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities.  The systems developed  and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS);  Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS);  Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL);  Special Operations Tactical Video System/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS/RSTA);  Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP);  Integrated Survey Program (ISP);  and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).    

OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (TEAM)    

•   NSSS.  This program provides research and development and rapid prototyping as the HQ SOCOM Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program.  NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by leveraging National Geospatial-Intelligence (NGA) and Service development efforts to provide innovative space-based intelligence systems technologies and enhancements, products and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units to include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid development, fielding and deployment, and focus on transitioning to SOCOM Programs of Records (POR). These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing Military Intelligence Programs.  Focus items include:  Small Unmanned Aircraft System Multi-Intelligence geo-location and targeting capabilities with a Rapid Reliable Targeting system that supports NGA CAT1 level targeting, enhanced GEOINT processing capabilities by fusing Light Detection and Ranging with National Technical Means (NTM) and the Enhanced Image Rendering Tool, which allows sharing of NTM Imagery with coalition forces.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improve detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automate radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using NTM.

•   JTWS.  The JTWS System of Systems (SoS) enables the SOF Cryptologic Operator to collect, process, locate and exploit threat communications signals of interest in order to provide timely, relevant, and responsive intelligence, cross-cueing, and threat avoidance information directly to the SOF Commanders.  The JTWS SoS is assembled in four variants: Ground SIGINT Kit; Maritime; Air; and Unmanned Aerial Systems.  Each variant has additional requirements for Communications Intelligence, Electronic Intelligence, and Precision Geo-location.

•   HF-TTL.  This program utilizes a commodity procurement strategy to provide SOF warfighters with the necessary tools to find, fix, and finish terrorist networks through the emplacement of sophisticated tags and devices that feed into an integrated architecture.  HF-TTL provides Global Combatant Commanders (GCC) and SOF operators with an immediate capability to tag, track, and locate people, things, and activities.  The HF-TTL program provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners.  The mission sets comprise a mix of different classes of tags and their associated detection, interrogation, viewing, tracking, and communications systems that are fielded annually to SOF Components and TSOC based upon dynamic and emergent SOF operational requirements.  

•  TVS/RSTA.  This program provides SOF with critical Special Reconnaissance (SR) equipment that directly supports the planning and execution of SOF missions.  This capability allows the SOF warfighter to meet SOF SR mission requirements to find, fix, finish, exploit, analyze, and disseminate information of an adversary’s movement, construct, identification, location; and associated things and activities.  TVS/RSTA provides GCC and SOF operators with an immediate capability to visually and electronically acquire people, things, and activities and provides actionable intelligence for SOF planners and Commanders.  The program Family of Systems (FoS) consists of interoperable equipment to capture and transfer near-real-time ground-based, tactical day/night/reduced visibility, imagery, video, and electronic proximity and movement sensing, all capable of dissemination through SOF organic, global C4I, and commercial communications infrastructures.

ABOVE OPERATIONAL ELEMENT (GARRISON) 

• SOFPREP.  This program serves as the intelligence focal point for production of SOF enhanced GEOINT (maps, imagery, and terrain data) and 3D scene visualization databases. SOFPREP gathers, processes, exploits, disseminates, and manages classified high resolution 3D databases and GEOINT data in support of SOF training, mission rehearsal, and execution preparation systems. The program builds the SOF common geospatial environment and manages the authoritative database of SOF-specific GEOINT terrain data.  SOFPREP is a NGA-certified co-producer in support of time-sensitive SOF specific requirements. 

•   ISP.  This program collects and produces current, detailed, tactical planning data to support military operations to counter threats against U.S. citizens, interests, and property located both domestically and overseas. ISP products are specifically tailored packages that provide operational information, as well as intelligence data for use by DOD and the U.S. Department of State to support operational planners for counter-terrorism operations, evacuations, and other rescue missions.

•   SSE.  This program provides the capability to exploit personnel, documents, electronic data, material, and forensic evidence on sensitive sites/objectives.  Biometric kits allow collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level mobile forensic capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  NSSS introduces and integrates national systems capabilities into the SOF force structure and operations.  This is accomplished by partnering with existing IC POR to incorporate SOF mission requirements into current and developing technologies and assets.  This leveraging of funds increases national and commercial systems awareness, demonstrates the tactical utility of national systems and commercial data, tests technologies and evaluates operational concepts in biennial Joint Staff Special Projects, and allows for the transition of promising concepts and technologies to other SOF program offices for execution.

•  JTWS is a SoS leveraging commercial technologies and partnerships with other government agencies.  The POR will identify Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf capabilities requiring minimal modifications and only use new development when necessary. JTWS will address the continuously evolving threat environments on the Ground, Air, Maritime, and Unmanned Aircraft System variants, leverage existing partnerships with the National Security Agency and other government partners to integrate and sustain systems based on prioritized need from the Components and as emerging threats require technology modernizations.  Additionally, the POR will work to find common solutions across the variants and increase interoperability in order to reduce duplication of efforts.  The contracting strategy is a mixture of full and open competition for prime integrators and leveraging existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for COTS procurement.

•   HF-TTL utilizes a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide highly sophisticated TTL and close target audio/video devices capable of operating in various environments as needed to meet SOF operational requirements. Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, device level modifications, integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.  

•  TVS/RSTA employs an evolutionary strategy to incorporate the latest state of technology within its product line to provide upgraded next-generation technology insertion of COTS systems and address the changing threat environment to meet SOF reconnaissance and surveillance mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources will be leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations. 

•   SOFPREP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   ISP employs an evolutionary strategy to insert emerging technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities tailored to SOF user-defined mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.

•   SSE uses a commodity procurement acquisition strategy to provide next-generation technologies for collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination capabilities supporting SOF exploitation mission requirements.  Commercial and government agency sources are leveraged for required certifications, system level integration, functional, and operational testing and evaluations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, testing and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized equipment will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Current efforts include, but are not limited to counter-improvised explosive device system development and testing to meet continually emerging Counter RC-IED threats. 

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:

Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices and visual augmentation to include next generation laser designation and geo-location systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides specialized equipment to meet the unique operator protection and survival requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF) to include: Army Rangers; Army Special Forces; Navy Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) teams; Navy Special Boat Units; Air Force Operators; and Marine Raiders.  Specialized equipment improves survivability protection from the environment by providing the operator with hearing protection and clothing systems, as well load bearing equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions, and personnel safety equipment.  These missions are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. 

SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) provides for the research, development, testing and evaluation of a variety of individual and survival equipment to include: ballistic and environmental protective systems, combat uniforms, load carriage systems, communications headsets, and visual augmentation system mounts.  

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) provides medical devices, ancillary equipment and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) sets for SOF. The CASEVAC procures a suite of Food and Drug Administration approved medical items including, but not limited, to intraosseous infusion devices, patient monitoring and assessment devices, emergency airway kits, as well as devices that provide SOF the capability to support extraction, extrication, mobility, transportation, and sustainment of casualties in forward areas.  This program fields tactical medical and CASEVAC capabilities with the intention to transition capabilities developed under the National Mission Force Tactical Medical Programs.  This capability provides significant ability to lessen battlefield losses by providing timely, critical lifesaving and evacuation capabilities to the forward-deployed SOF operators. 

Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) program provides SOF with the ability to counter current and future RC-IED threats used by terrorist networks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. 

•  SOF Deployable Node (SDN) is a family of deployable, super high frequency, multi-band, Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems providing the transport path for high-capacity, voice, data, video tele-conferencing (VTC), and full motion video at all levels of classification.  It consists of SDN subprograms, transport for intelligence variants, technology insertions and capital equipment replacement.

•  Civil Information Management (CIM).  The CIM Data Processing System (CIMDPS) is an automation system that assists active Civil Affairs (CA) and others engaged in civil-military operations to collect, process, analyze, maintain, mine, and deliver Civil Information and analysis products in support of military operations.  

•  The Special Communications (SPCOM) Enterprise program, formerly justified as the Special Communication Enterprise (SCE) includes organizations, practices, processes, services, networks, systems and subsystems that manage and provide clandestine exchange of information between elements (field-to-field, field-to-base, base-to-field) for worldwide deployed SOF units, often in austere environments with heavy adversarial monitoring.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.

- The Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) provides SOF operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. The TACLAN consists of Suites, Mission Planning Kits and Field Computing Devices, Coalition Local Area Network, and Full Motion Video Kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios, which includes SOF Tactical Communications (STC), and Blue Force Tracking (BFT), rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017 Unmanned ISR represents the approved consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies Program Element (PE) 0304210BB; MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), PE 0305219BB; MQ-8, PE 0305231BB; RQ-11, UAV PE 1105232BB; and RQ-7 UAV, PE 1105233BB.

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&amp;T) capabilities for SOF.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. SAFC develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. This program provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>NOTE:  Beginning in FY 2017, Unmanned ISR represents the approved consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies Program Element (PE) 0304210BB; MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), PE 0305219BB; MQ-8 PE 0305231BB; RQ-11 UAV PE 1105232BB; and RQ-7 UAV, PE 1105233BB.

This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  

Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC). Provides for efforts to develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) payloads to advance ISR capabilities to address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.

Group 1 UAS.  Group 1 UAS are small tactical systems, less than 20 pounds in weight.  Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.

Group 2 UAS.  Group 2 UAS are medium tactical systems, between 21 pounds and 55 pounds in weight. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.

Group 3 UAS.  Group 3 UAS are large tactical systems that weigh less than 1,320 pounds and fly less than flight level 180.    

Group 4 UAS.  Group 4 UAS are large systems that weigh greater than 1,320 pounds and fly higher than flight level 180. Provides for development efforts to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for the development and testing of a variety of incremental upgrades to Special Operations Forces (SOF) Vehicles and ancillary equipment.  Current SOF tactical vehicles include: Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicles (Light), Ground Mobility Vehicles (Medium), Non-Standard Commercial Vehicles (Commercial) for use in tactical missions, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (Heavy).  The SOF mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project develops, tests, and evaluates Special Operations vehicles and modifications.  The Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  The current family of SOF tactical vehicles include: individual mobility vehicles, light mobility vehicles, medium mobility vehicles, non-standard commercial vehicles, and heavy mobility vehicles.     

Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FSOV).  This initiative provides for product improvements in the areas of suspension, power management, armor protection and unique vehicle design for all SOF tactical vehicle configurations.  Designs must be standardized across all SOF Components that utilize a tactical vehicle.   Improvements include, but are not limited to, new engineering change proposals (ECPs), field safety issues and theater endorsed requirements that make it essential to keep up with the increased weight and minimize the impact to mobility on the basic vehicle.  FSOV develops, integrates and tests Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems in order to reduce space and power claim on vehicles and develop safety and engineering improvements that specifically address the enemy’s changing tactics on the battlefield which typically focuses on survivability, force protection, or mobility.  Specific efforts include but are not limited to: Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) Medium Version 1.1 effort which provides for a medium vehicle variant capable of meeting specific requirements of internal aircraft transport on the C/MH-47.  The effort also provides for engineering costs related to performance, endurance, safety testing, integration and logistical analysis of product samples.  Additionally, efforts include ECPs associated with the Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle (NSCV), the Lightweight Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV).  These ECPs will address any identified safety, reliability, and performance concerns.  Finally, funding will be used to support vehicle signature reduction efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This project will utilize mature technologies, which include electric propulsion along with upgraded navigation, communication, and sensor suites.  It also provides for integration efforts with the current Dry Deck Shelter (DDS), development of engineering changes for SWCS production craft configuration, and integration of other diving technologies to meet SOF requirements.  

•  Dry Combat Submersible (DCS): This sub-project provides for the advanced engineering, manufacturing, testing, and development efforts for a surface-launched, dry, diver lock-in/lock-out vessel capable of inserting and extracting SOF and/or payloads into denied areas.  USSOCOM awarded an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in FY 2016 to produce one production representative vessel, with options to produce two additional vessels.   USSOCOM is testing one submersible prototype to validate test, commercial classification, and SOCOM safety certification processes and will continue to use the prototype to evaluate capability enhancing technologies and reduce risk in the DCS program.

•   DDS Modernization:  This sub-project provides for the pre-planned product improvements, testing, and integration of specialized underwater systems to meet the unique requirements of SOF, and compatibility with the submarine fleet.  The current DDS is a certified diving system which attaches to modified host submarines that provides for insertion of SOF forces and platforms.  Funding supports product improvements to the current DDS, as well as associated diver equipment for in-service submarine support systems, unmanned underwater vehicles, and follow on development efforts for future SOF payloads.

•   SOF Combat Diving:  This sub-project provides for the engineering, manufacturing, testing, development, and transition of SOF peculiar diving equipment providing the SOF combat diver the ability to engage the enemy and conduct operations.  SOF Combat Diving will provide capabilities to USSOCOM components and will support the SDV, SWCS, and DCS in conduct of infiltration/extraction, material recovery, underwater ship attack, beach clearance, and other missions.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, commercial and developmental life support, maneuverability, employment of weapons, diver navigational accuracy and situational awareness, thermal protection, and underwater communications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement (P3I) and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF).  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  Sub-projects include:

•   Combatant Craft Medium Mk 1 (CCM):  This sub-project is a semi-enclosed, low-observable, multi-mission combatant craft for platoon-size maritime mobility in maritime denied environments.  It is multi-mission capable, including Maritime Interdiction, Insert / Extract, and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) Operations.  CCM is Naval Special Warfare’s (NSW) craft-of-choice for long-range, high-payload SOF mobility operations in denied environments up to high threat.  CCM has NSW’s best Iron Triangle: 40 knot (kt) speed; 4 crew + 19 passengers (pax) / 10,000 pound (lb) payload; and 600 nautical miles (nm) range.  CCM Mk 1 payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 60 feet long, CCM is C-17 / C5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based trailer.  

•   Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH):  This sub-project represents a family of solutions that provides platoon-size maritime surface mobility.  The current CCH is the Sea, Air, Land Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft.  SEALION is a fully-enclosed, climate-controlled, low-observable, semi-submersible craft that operates in denied environments up to high-threat. SEALION is NSW’s most versatile and survivable combatant craft and the craft-of-choice for sensitive maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions and those missions requiring a prolonged presence in denied environments.  Its clandestine mobility capability is only exceeded by an undersea craft.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 7 crew + 12 pax / 3,300 lb payload; and 400 nm range.  SEALION payload capacity enables inclusion of shock mitigating seats, which is critical for ride quality, operator tactical readiness, and operator health.  At 77+ feet long, SEALION is C-17/C-5 transportable and can launch/recover by well deck or shore based mobile travel lift or crane.  

•   Next Generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared Radar (NG CCFLIR):  The CCFLIR capability provides SOF with a multi-sensor, electro-optic system that enhances SOF effectiveness by improving their ability to detect, recognize, identify, range, track, and highlight objects of interest in a maritime environment.  The NG CCFLIR will use technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as operational range, image fusion, net-centric data sharing, information assurance, and seamless craft and combat systems integration.

•   Combatant Craft Mission Equipment (CCME):  This sub-project (previously Next Generation Surface Systems) provides a rapid response capability to support SOF combatant craft systems, subsystems, and their emerging requirements.  CCME provides technology refresh efforts to correct system deficiencies, improve asset life, and enhance mission capability.  Demonstrations and modifications may be made to support emerging capability enhancements such as, but not limited to, conformal antennas, identification friend-or-foe capabilities, enhanced communications, weapon integration, software refresh, and navigation subsystems in support of future missions.  Solutions to these emerging requirements may be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), leveraged from other Government agencies , or new solutions. 

•   Combatant Craft Assault (CCA):  This sub-project is a National-to-Theater transition.  The CCA is the theater version of the High Speed Assault Craft.  The CCA is a low-observable combatant craft for squad-size maritime mobility operations in maritime denied environments.  CCA is NSW’s best craft for VBSS in maritime denied environments up to and including medium threat.  It is the craft-of-choice for maritime interdiction and boarding operations because of the open deck space, maneuverability, and interoperability with an Afloat Forward Staging Base.  Iron Triangle: 40 kt speed; 3 crew + 12 pax / 5,000 lb payload; and 300 nm range.  At 41 feet long, CCA is air transportable by C-130 / C-17 / C-5 and can launch/recover by crane, davit, well deck, or shore based trailer.

•  Threat Awareness System (TAS):  This sub-project provides SOF with an Electronic Intelligence capability for enhanced force protection of SOF in Maritime denied environments by allowing them to identify and avoid enemy detection capabilities.  TAS will utilize technological advancements to gain significant improvements in capability such as miniaturization and marinization to enable seamless craft integration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM acquisition strategy was a competition using a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH:  SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from U.S. Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  Based on market research completed in December 2015; currently pursuing a Sole Source award for SEALION III in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.

•  NG CCFLIR:  Completed a full and open competition in September 2015.  An Engineering Manufacturing Development contract was awarded to FLIR Systems Incorporated, which included production and sustainment options.  The NG CCFLIR will be installed on the CCM, CCH, and CCA.

•  CCME acquisition strategy emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Crafts. CCME accomplishes this by using the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies including the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L Science &amp; Technology. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, to then transition to the craft. The integration and procurement piece is managed by the individual Combatant Craft Program.

•  CCA will use various contracting and better buying power practices to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the craft’s current performance envelope.

•  TAS will conduct market research to determine feasibility and appropriateness of conducting a full and open competition. TAS will pursue existing Government-Off-The-Shelf technology in order to reduce acquisition timeline.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

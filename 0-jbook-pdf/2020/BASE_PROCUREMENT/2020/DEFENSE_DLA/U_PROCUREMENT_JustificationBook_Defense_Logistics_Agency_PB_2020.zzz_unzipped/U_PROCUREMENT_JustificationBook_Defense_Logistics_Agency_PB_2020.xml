            <proc:Description>FY 2020-2024, the DLA Procurement program consists of Passenger Carrying Motor Vehicles (PCMV),  Logistics Support Activity (LSA) equipment, Warstoppers, and Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) equipment.  
The FY20 request includes PCMV ($223K), LSA ($6,416K), Warstoppers ($492K), and MWR ($991K).    

PCMV replacement is required to support DLA's overseas logistics operations. DLA maintains field offices in Europe, Kuwait, Korea, England and Japan. Replacement of Agency-owned and commercially leased PCMVs with owned PCMVs is required in cases when it is less expensive to own rather than commercially lease, or GSA Leased vehicles are not available.  PCMV ownership is usually significantly less expensive than commercial leasing at overseas locations.

Logistics Support Activity - this program is reported in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 119(a)(1).  Department of Defense provided additional Procurement funds for increased requirements in this program in FY 2020 and FY 2021. 

WARSTOPPER Program continues to fund the effort to modernize the microcircuit surge capability for emulated legacy (no active production) microcircuits.  These microcircuits are identified as critical within over a hundred weapon systems and present an industrial readiness vulnerability.    The modernization plan for the surge capability will require recurring funds for three additional years of funding.  An additional requirement is also identified for electron tube manufacturing equipment for surge production.  Electron tubes continue to be a critical element in many weapon systems and require Government investment to ensure industry can meet wartime requirements.

MWR-Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) systems at the Child Development Center (CDC) require upgrades and expanded coverage of video surveillance capabilities. The systems are to mitigate anti-terrorism and
force protection vulnerabilities, and enhanced security at the CDCs as well as serve as an institutional child abuse deterrent. The enhanced remote viewing of the center is required to ensure the safety and
well-being of our children as well as employees. These systems are required by DoD.</proc:Description>

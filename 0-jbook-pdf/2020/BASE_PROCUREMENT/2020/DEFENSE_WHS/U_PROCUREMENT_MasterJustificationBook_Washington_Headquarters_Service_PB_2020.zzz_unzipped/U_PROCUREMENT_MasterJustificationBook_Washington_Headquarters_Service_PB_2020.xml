Funding supported capability development of a Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS);  documentation; operating concepts development; system and operation integration; employment tactics, and training at a Pentagon site.
 
The FY 2019 budget request funds procurement of physical security vehicles assigned to missions in high threat OCONUS locations, specifically the life-cycle replacement cost for one Commercial Heavy Armored Vehicle (CHAV) that supports the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and OSD Senior officials providing a secure and reliable ground transportation capability. In addition to the CHAVs request, the line item includes life-cycle replacement cost of information technology (IT) equipment which directly supports the mission of the Washington Headquarters Services White House Military Office (WHMO) that provides essential services to the President that helps to maintain continuity of operations (COOP).

This FY 2020 budget request funds procurement of physical security vehicles assigned to missions in high threat OCONUS locations.

The DOD Indian Incentive Program (IIP) is authorized by Section 504 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (U.S.C 1544).  In 1989, Congress began providing annual funds through the DOD Appropriation Act for the DOD Indian Incentive Program.  The program motivates prime contractors to utilize Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises by providing a 5% rebate on subcontracted work performed by those companies that fall into the following categories:  Federally Recognized American Indian Organizations, Indian-Owned economics enterprises and small businesses owned by members of recognized tribes, Native Alaskans or Native Hawaiians.  Through the generation of subcontracts to the above mentioned entities, the IIP fulfills its purpose as an economic multiplier for Native American communities.</proc:Description>

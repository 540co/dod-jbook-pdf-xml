*	0603118A Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2020 this PE is being eliminated, with continuity of effort realigned to PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) as part of the United States (U.S.) Army's Science and Technology portfolio financial restructure. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy. 

This PE provides Soldiers and Small Combat Units with the most effective personal clothing, equipment, combat rations, shelters, and logistical support items with the least weight and sustainment burden. This PE supports the maturation and demonstration of technologies associated with aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, rapid ammunition/munitions deployability and resupply, combat rations and combat feeding equipment, combat clothing and personal equipment (including protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear), and expeditionary base camps with an emphasis on emerging operating environments and missions that require expeditionary maneuver. The Projects focus on the challenge of integrating clothing and individual equipment on the Soldier to effectively bridge the gap between humans, technology, and equipment design. The Projects in this PE adhere to Tri-Service Agreements on clothing, textiles, and food with coordination provided through the Cross-Service Warfighter Equipment Board, the Soldier as a System Integrated Concepts Development Team, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board.

PE 0603118A Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology, Projects: 
     * BE5 Personnel &amp; Airdrop Safety Advanced Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel. Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.

Work in this Project is fully coordinated with Program Element (PE) 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) and supports Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms.
 
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

This Project also invests in understanding the trade-offs of integrating state-of-the-art technology with Soldiers' personal protection, electronics connectivity, power and energy, user interfaces and display content, and other mission specific equipment that seeks to reduce physical weight, cognitive burden, and sustainment needs of the small unit. This Project develops, matures, and maintains a Soldier Systems Engineering Architecture (SSEA) framework that represents human factors consideration in development of major Army platforms. Efforts in this Project focus on integrating and demonstrating system- level personal protection, durable Soldier protective clothing and individual equipment, environmental threats, and power management solutions. In addition, special focus is on understanding and demonstrating the impacts of physical and cognitive load on Soldier mission performance by implementing strategies to reduce load and/ or optimize loads to reduce injuries, and the creation of user interfaces that mitigate the impact of increasing technologies and sensors worn and carried by Soldiers. These efforts integrate geographically dispersed laboratory environments to conduct comprehensive assessments and report the technical viability of Soldier system solutions and conducts field demonstrations to obtain relevant feedback for user acceptance and performance validation. This Project also matures and demonstrates mission command and power and energy technologies for the dismounted Soldier and small unit operating in a networked operating environment.

     * XW6 Small Unit Expeditionary Maneuver</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates mission-specific plug and play components, subsystems, and modules designed to optimize manpower requirements, improve situational awareness, increase Soldier readiness and survivability, improve habitation, reduce logistics footprint, enhance supportability, and reduce cost. Expeditionary Base Camp (EBC) systems (or remote command outposts) provide an operational capability for Small Combat Units (battalion and below) and Soldiers, which are rapidly deployable/re-locatable, require no Military Construction, and need limited materiel handing support. The need for this technologically enabled capability has arisen as a result of new tactics, techniques, and procedures used in austere, remote, and challenging environments in which stability operations, counterinsurgency operations, and peace keeping missions are conducted. The Army envisions continuing to conduct this full range of operations worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. This project integrates mature technologies to create mission specific lab demonstrators and assesses the performance capabilities using metrics and methodologies developed under Program Element (PE) 0602786A / Project VT4. Demonstrated EBC equipment is transitioned to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS).

Work in this Project complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology), PE 0602105A (Materials Technology), PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology), PE 0603734A (Military Engineering Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603125A (Combating Terrorism Technology Development), and PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science and Sensor Technology).

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project MM7 (Enabling Med Cap to Support Dispersed OPS Adv Tech) is a new start for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020. 

As detailed in each Project-level R-2A exhibit, all other Projects in this Program Element (PE) either re-organize activities that were previously funded within this same PE or transition successful Applied Research from PE 0602787A (Medical Technology).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and demonstrates advanced medical technologies including drugs, vaccines, medical diagnostic devises, measures for identification and vector control, and developing medical practices and procedures to effectively protect and improve the survivability of United States Forces across the entire spectrum of military operations. Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.

Promising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for human medical products, and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.

Blast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Medical Research Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project maturates and demonstrates United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated medical countermeasures such as drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic (identification of the nature and cause of a particular disease) systems to naturally occurring infectious diseases that are threats to deployed United States military forces. The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Research conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:

(1)	Prevention/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases
(2)	Bacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)
(3)	Viral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)
(4)	Diagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control

Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).

Work is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems - Adv Dev), Project 808 (DoD Drug &amp; Vacc Ad).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by USAMRMC at Fort Detrick, MD.

Efforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort selects promising anti-parasitic drug candidates for treating malaria and leishmaniasis for testing in humans, and prepares data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans. Studies have shown that the malaria parasite can become resistant to existing drugs, which makes it necessary to continually develop new and more effective and safe treatments. This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans, and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans. A malaria vaccine would minimize the progression and impact of drug resistance and eliminate the need to take preventive anti-malarial drugs.</r2:Description>

Evaluated currently available and new products for control of compressible bleeding under prolonged field care scenarios, i.e., when medical evacuation is delayed and/or prolonged. Performed animal studies to determine impact of prolonged hypotensive (low blood pressure) resuscitation, due to delayed evacuation, on subsequent survival once patient receives definitive surgical care and full resuscitation. Evaluated different types of mechanical interventions (e.g., compression, wound packing, use of tourniquets) to determine optimal practices for control of bleeding from junctional wounds. Continued to evaluate small volume resuscitative therapies with blood products and hemostatic drugs (drugs that stop or slow down the flow of blood) to identify combinations that optimally mitigate the effects of inflammation and prolonged ischemia (inadequate or absent blood supply) in critical tissues. Evaluated methods to refrigerate whole blood that do not impair platelet function. In FY 2018, $1,204,00 was reprogrammed and moved to 0602787A Project 874 Combat Casualty Care Technology.</r2:Text>

The aim of this Project is to develop a data-driven, intelligent and autonomous combat evacuation medical capability by maturing relevant artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms and processes. These efforts will support initial and sustained integrated theater health care and trauma care delivery in future dispersed operations characterized by delayed evacuation, prolonged care, and reduced/denied communications. AI and machine learning technologies developed in this Project aim to reduce military combat casualties by enabling autonomous evacuation utilizing future Army Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and ground platforms. Pursuant to these aims, this Project will research and design a tele-monitored and remote-controlled medical module to support medical resupply and casualty evacuation. The medical module will be developed to be self-contained, providing a "roll-on, roll-off" medical capability to future multi-purpose UAS and ground platforms.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project covers technology development, demonstration, and transition of a candidate malaria prevention drug with weekly or less frequent dosing. The candidate drug may also be effective for the treatment of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. Infectious disease prevention sustains individual and unit readiness and reduces health services requirements and cost. Research is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use.

Work is managed by the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A, Project 808.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project covers technology development, demonstration, and transition of a candidate vaccine for the prevention of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome caused by any of the 4 dengue virus types. The vaccine will be effective in people with and without a prior history of dengue infection. Infectious disease prevention sustains individual and unit readiness and reduces health services requirements and cost.

Work in this Project is managed by the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.

Promising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A, Project 808.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY 2020 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Work in this Project is performed by USAMRMC at Fort Detrick, MD.

Efforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Program Element (PE) 0603466A Air and Missile Defense Advanced Technology, Projects:
*	AD1 High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator Advanced Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates advanced technologies for future High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons technology. The major effort under this Project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon. SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), UAVs, cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges. HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance. This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). 
 
The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

Work is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

*	BH8 Enhanced VETRONICS Advanced Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware such as computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command/control/driving mechanisms as well as vehicle software to enhance crew performance, increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) burdens and reduce vehicle maintenance costs. This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance / Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces.
Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver portfolio.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Program Element (PE) 0603462A Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology, Projects:
*	BF4 Combat Vehicle Robotics Adv Tech
*	BK1 Autonomous Mobility Adv Tech</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies to enable Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) including sensor technologies, perception hardware and software, and control technologies that allow the Soldier to perform mission tasks more efficiently. Challenges addressed include: obstacle avoidance, overcoming perception limitations, intelligent situational behaviors, command and control by Soldier operators, frequency of human intervention, operations in adverse weather, and autonomy enabled vehicles protecting themselves and their surroundings from intruders. Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.

The approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office. Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio. Ground Maneuver Portfolio investments are greatly improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform/protect the maneuver force (Robotic Wingman JCTD).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) matures and validates applied behavioral and social science technologies that enhance the Soldier Lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g. unit cohesion). These technologies provide advanced personnel measures that more fully assess potential and predict performance, behavior, attitudes, and resilience. These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units, assesses innovative training methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Work in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.

Work in this PE complements and is fully coordinated with PE 0602785A (Manpower/Personnel/Training Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Vision, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates immersive technologies that include the application of photorealistic synthetic environments, multi-sensory interfaces, virtual humans, and training applications on low-cost game platforms for Soldier training applications using simulation technologies. This Project uses advanced modeling, simulation, and leadership development techniques to leverage the emerging immersive technologies that are created at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the University of Southern California to develop training demonstrators. These demonstrators focus on urban operations, asymmetric warfare, resilience and rehabilitation to support Warfighting units and Army Institutions (Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and Army Medical Command (MEDCOM)). Resilience and rehabilitation research will focus on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The ICT's collaboration with its entertainment partners creates a true synthesis of creativity and technology that harnesses the capabilities of industry, and the research and development community to advance the Army's capabilities.

The cited work is consistent with the S&amp;T priorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates Soldier Lethality technologies that improve Soldier operational performance by increasing lethality, mobility, protection, and optimizing situational awareness across the spectrum of operating environments and missions. This PE matures Soldier weapons and enabling components/subsystems, demonstrates lethal weapons systems with potential to provide greater lethality, target acquisition, fire control, and range at a significantly reduced weight for optimized Soldier and Small Unit system performance. The major focus areas for Soldier Lethality S&amp;T are Soldier weapons and ammunition technologies, protection technologies, cognitive and physical performance measures, training in synthetic training environments, and mission support capabilities such as situational awareness sensors and displays, dismounted power and energy technologies, and Soldier and Small Unit sustainment capabilities. This technology diverse PE also matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage all targets and threats at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments), and for advancing live training technologies that accurately replicate and realistically represent the effects of current and future weapons systems during force-on-force and force-on-target training. This PE matures and demonstrates effective technology in personal combat clothing, protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear, combat rations, shelters, logistical support items for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, and energy systems to power current and emerging Soldier-born ISR, sensor, optical, and communication systems with the least weight and sustainment burden on the Soldiers and Small Combat Units. This PE matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a single, interconnected synthetic training system that will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. A specific research thrust area is applying systems-based practices to mature and demonstrate scientific and tailored knowledge of Soldiers' physical and cognitive architecture to facilitate rapid and efficient designs, assessments and trade-off analyses of technology insertions on the Soldier. Significant S&amp;T investments are directed to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes while reducing the size and weight of the form factor of the equipment. 

Work in this PE complements PE 0602143A-Soldier Lethality Technology.

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in Support of the National Defense Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates equipment and innovative techniques for precision aerial delivery of cargo and personnel. Technologies support Army Modernization Priority, Soldier Lethality. Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery to support the mission readiness profile for Global Response Force (GRF). These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes; guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems; tracking sensors; software algorithms; and safety rigging that integrates with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors and reduction of Soldier load.

This effort complements work done in the Science &amp; Technology Precision, Navigation and Timing Modernization priority.

Program Element (PE) 0603115A Next Generation Training &amp; Simulation Systems, Projects:
*	S29 Modeling &amp; Simulation - Advanced Technology Development
*	S31 Modeling And Simulation Infrastructure Technology</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project investigates and develops technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a comprehensive live-virtual-constructive architecture that will enable Soldiers to train the spectrum of missions in virtual environments involving thousands of virtual combatants and miles of complex terrain including megacities. The STE will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon / Multi-Domain Operations, combined arms maneuver, and mission command training at the point of need anywhere in the world, increasing Soldier and Small Unit proficiency through repetition. Units can then master collective training tasks in the live environment. The Project leverages the capabilities of industry and the research and development community, to include work at the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT). This project matures and demonstrates a distributed modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment that integrates a collection of multi-fidelity models and simulations and tools that map to an evolving architecture and M&amp;S activities to support decisions throughout the acquisition life-cycle; and provides a unifying M&amp;S architecture that synchronizes and integrates multi-resolution modeling applications such as Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) experimentation utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled attributes. This Project  focuses on researching cutting-edge M&amp;S methods to enable the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD) to perform critical System of Systems (SoS) analysis, experimentation, technology tradeoffs, capability assessments, concept development, and training that saves time and resources while increasing the effectiveness of acquisition and training activities.

This effort complements work done in 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) / Project BE8 (Synthetic Training Environment (STE) Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

Work in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this Program Element (PE) is being realigned to the following PEs:
* 0603463A Network C3I Advanced Technology
* 0603465A Future Vertical Lift Advanced Technology Project:
* 0603462A Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology
* 0603457A C3I Cyber Advanced Development</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In FY 2020 this PE is being eliminated, with continuity of effort realigned to other PEs as part of the United States (U.S.) Army's Science and Technology portfolio financial restructure. All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

This PE matures and demonstrates electronic warfare (EW) sensors and software intended to deny, disrupt, locate or destroy the enemy's command, control and communications (C3) systems and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets. This PE matures both countermeasures (CM) and counter-countermeasures (CCM) to deny the enemy the use of their systems while protecting United States (U.S.) assets from enemy deception and jamming. Project CY3 matures and demonstrates architecture, sensor and software techniques to provide operationally relevant capabilities for cyber support at Corps level and below and enables cyber situational awareness, command and control, mission rehearsal, observable reporting, and framework to incrementally advance cyber tool development. Project K15 matures and demonstrates capabilities to locate and exploit enemy communication systems including computer networks. Project K16 matures and demonstrates multifunctional EW capabilities (jamming) to enhance platform survivability and provide near real-time situational awareness to the Commander through the detection, identification and geo-location of emitters of interest.

Work in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0603772A (Advanced Tactical Computer Science) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0602601A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Technology), PE 0602618A (Ballistics Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603004A (Weapons and Munitions Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603313A (Missile and Rocket Advanced Technology) and PE 0603794A (Command, Control and Communications Advanced Technology).

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates technologies for offensive and defensive cyber operations in tactical environments. Efforts optimize devices, techniques, services, software and algorithms to enable cyber situational understanding and Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA). For offensive cyber, efforts demonstrate integrated electronic attack (EA) and CEMA hardware and software to execute force protection (FP), EA, electronic surveillance (ES), signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic warfare (EW) and cyber missions in a dynamic, distributed and coordinated fashion. For defensive cyber, efforts demonstrate hardware and software to protect tactical wired and wireless networks against modern cyber attacks and focuses on configuration, operation, monitoring, data integrity, and defense in bandwidth constrained tactical environments while reducing the operator workload required to conduct these functions.

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) addresses the supercomputing requirements of Department of Defense (DoD) scientists and engineers by: (1) demonstrating and maturing the most advanced, leading-edge computational architectures while exploiting the resulting systems by employing complementary specialized expertise; (2) demonstrating and maturing the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), which investigates, demonstrates, and matures leading-edge digital networking and security technologies to securely deliver computational capabilities to the distributed DoD Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) community; and (3) leveraging specialized expertise from DoD, other federal departments and agencies, industry, and academia to demonstrate and mature leading-edge software application codes. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive computational capabilities to demonstrate and mature emerging technologies that address the supercomputing requirements of the DoD RDTE community in the areas of hardware, software, and programming environments. All HPCMP sites are interconnected to each other, the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) RDTE community, and other major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which investigates, demonstrates, and matures (a) state-of-the-art digital networking technologies to ensure a robust distributed environment and (b) the most advanced digital security capabilities to protect the intellectual property of the DoD and its contract entities as they employ HPCMP capabilities. The HPCMP's software application effort (a) optimizes, enhances, demonstrates, and matures critical DoD physics-based and engineering software to allow scientists and engineers to execute calculations with precision and efficiency on leading-edge supercomputers, (b) demonstrates and matures immersive collaborative programming environments to improve science and engineering workflows, and (c) demonstrates and matures leading-edge computational technology from academia and industry. These synergistic activities collectively demonstrate and mature horizontal technologies that are exploited across the DoD RDTE community, ensuring the DoD maintains the most advanced research and development ecosystem in computationally-intensive modeling and design.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project enables the Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) community to resolve critical scientific and engineering problems more quickly, and with more precision, using advanced, physics-based computer simulation supported by high performance computing (HPC) technology. The computational expertise and resources enable Department of Defense (DoD) personnel to analyze phenomena that are often impossible, not cost effective, too time-consuming, or too dangerous to study any other way. The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.

The work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Autonomous Ground Resupply (AGR) will mature and demonstrate an improved ground supply distribution system across multiple levels of strategic and tactical sustainment operations. The effort will equip existing military ground vehicles with scalable robotic technology through the integration of modular kits, common interfaces, and a common architecture to improve inter-node supply movement. Further, the system will modernize and optimize the operations within the supply nodes to improve accountability and throughput. The objective of AGR is to integrate new and emerging technologies into the Army's sustainment system to improve throughput, accountability, and safety and provide the Warfighter with the flexibility needed to meet future needs. 

The work under this Project will transition to the Leader Follower Program of Record (PoR). The architecture and safety work under this Project also lays the groundwork for the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).

This Project matures and demonstrates simulation tools that predict autonomous vehicle performance. This Project matures and demonstrates a real-time simulator that provides the ability to design and assess ground vehicle autonomous behaviors in adverse environmental conditions, reducing the need for field testing. These simulation technologies can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.

                                <r2:Description>This effort focuses on maturing and demonstrating a common and open survivability architecture and core implementation to ensure its operational effectiveness.  Specifically, this effort includes extending the MAPS architecture across a broader set of active survivability capabilities and increasing the portfolio of Modular APS Framework (MAF) compliant technologies. In addition, this project will enhance the government-developed controller subsystem for performance and integration effectiveness with high speed digital signal processing and embedded systems/firmware/software which will be required due to the expanded active defense suite of sensors (e.g., electro-optic, infrared, radio frequency, magnetic, acoustic), sensor fusion, and explore synthesizing sensor data beyond situational awareness to situational understanding with context that can greatly enhance operational effectiveness and vehicle survivability. The activities under this effort provide incremental growth for broader threat spectrum defeat relevant to vehicle protection systems and will be aligned to capability gaps for transition to the acquisition community.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, integrates, and demonstrates vehicle electronics hardware such as computers, sensors, communications systems, displays, and vehicle command/control/driving mechanisms as well as vehicle software to enhance crew performance, increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) burdens and reduce vehicle maintenance costs. This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance / Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), that provides an open architecture to allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces. Overcoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test/evaluation.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies to increase autonomy and mobility to perform teamed operations with manned and unmanned air and ground vehicles in a military relevant environment through data collection on relevant platforms. Data collection will involve both simulation and live collection. Simulation will provide a baseline to correctly collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for improving algorithms for both formation control and unmanned aerial vehicle map input for unmanned ground vehicle mobility. Live data will start with Surrogate platforms in local areas. This will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligent methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI/ML techniques to mature and demonstrate intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for GPS. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to improve algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI/ML techniques to optimize intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of UAV mapped areas. Data collected from air vehicle will be converted to maneuverable information for unmanned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project AV2 will mature and develop Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation management for space order-of-battle architectures and protocols. The advanced technology development will involve using two spacecraft and will leverage commercial LEO mega-constellation investments to develop capabilities which support direct sensor-to-shooter data links while under control by a maneuver battalion commander. Technology will be developed to enable communications and deep strikes in contested environments. This Project supports the Army's efforts to proliferate and control space assets to support the tactical ground commander. It includes exploration efforts to augment missile warning, GPS, and global communications. Work aligns with development underway in Network, Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing (APNT), and Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) Cross Functional Teams (CFT).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage targets at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments). Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day/night/adverse weather conditions.

Work in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision and Electro-Optics Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).

All FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates technologies transitioned from PE 0602720A (Environmental Quality Technology) Projects 835 and 896 that address the management and mitigation of hazardous materials and chemicals, with a focus on mitigating impacts of new materiel that will enter the Army inventory within the next decade and beyond. This Project will shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive, scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies. Efforts in this Project assess environmental factors in mission planning activities that impact the battlefield landscape of future threats while also identifying opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments. These efforts will enable mission planners to identify the industrial/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. Technologies matured within this Project: inform the Army of potential environmental threats, opportunities, and mission impacts; help decision makers understand environmental threats in urban and industrial contested environments; and provide rapid sensing and assessment of the presence and extent of dangerous compounds in battlefield environments. 

A key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with myriad federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. This Project includes pilot-scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of risk mitigation techniques.

FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates software and architectures for geospatial mapping applications and decision aids for the Warfighter. Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and nonline-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for "upfront engineering" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. 

This work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832/Project D8Z.

This work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology). Geospatial activities are coordinated with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA).

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this Program Element (PE) is being eliminated, with continuity of effort realigned to the following PEs:
* PE 0603462A Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology 
* PE 0603463A Network C3I Advanced Technology
* PE 0603466A Air and Missile Defense Advanced Technology</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This PE matures and demonstrates technologies that allow the Warfighter to effectively collect, analyze, transfer and display situational awareness information in a network-centric battlefield environment, and the technologies that enable the integration of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) through Mission Command. It matures and demonstrates architectures, hardware, software and techniques that enable synchronized mission command (MC) during rapid, mobile, dispersed and Joint operations. Project 101 matures software, algorithms, services and devices to more effectively integrate MC across all echelons and enable more effective utilization of Warfighter resources including intelligent power management and distribution through accelerated information to decisions and rapid MC on the move. Project 243 matures and demonstrates signal processing and information/intelligence fusion software, algorithms, services and systems for Army sensors; radio frequency (RF) systems to track and identify enemy forces and personnel; and multi-sensor control and correlation software and algorithms to improve reconnaissance, surveillance, tracking, and target acquisition.

Work in this PE complements PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602303A (Missile Technology), PE 0602705A (Electronics and Electronic Devices), PE 0602782A (Command, Control, Communications Technology), and PE 0603270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), and is coordinated with PE 0602783A (Computer and Software Technology).

FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.

The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Work in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort develops software that gathers data from multi-function Airborne ISR sensor sources into a single common operating environment to streamline analysts processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) workflows.  The focus centers on developing scalable software that provides a near real time PED capability on board the platform with applicability at the ground stations and reach back for forensics and pattern analysis. It will increase the utility of moving target indicator (MTI) radar to the greater multiple intelligence (multi-INT) picture for better origin-to-destination tracking, which is crucial to understanding the higher-level threat picture and increases the effectiveness and action-ability of battlespace awareness/intelligence data throughout an area of operations. This effort implements an open architecture extensible throughout the tactical enterprise, allowing for growth to include future ISR sensors.

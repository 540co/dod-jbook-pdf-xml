                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element enables USSOCOM to conduct studies and develop laboratory prototypes for applied research and advanced technology development, as well as leverage other organizations' technology projects that may not otherwise be affordable within MFP-11.  Applying small incremental amounts of investments to Department of Defense (DOD), other government agencies, and commercial organizations allows USSOCOM to influence the direction of technology development or the schedule against which it is being pursued, and to acquire emerging technologies for Special Operations Forces.  This project provides an investment strategy for USSOCOM to link technology opportunities with capability deficiencies, capability objectives, technology thrust areas, human endurance and sensory performance, and technology development objectives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Small incremental co-investments with DOD, other government agencies, and commercial organizations allow USSOCOM to influence the schedule and direction of technology developments, emerging technologies, and capabilities for Special Operations Forces (SOF), with significant economies of investment.  This USSOCOM investment strategy is used to link technology opportunities with USSOCOM capability deficiencies, capability objectives; technology thrust areas, and technology objectives.  Technology development needs in these areas may be advertised to industry and government research and development agencies via agency announcements and calls for white papers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Includes cyber capabilities that predict the best media channels to reach potential target audiences, data mining and information collections tools, propaganda and social behavior analytical tools, cultural analysis tool sets and emerging technologies that support the planning and analytical needs for the Military Information Support Operations (MISO) forces.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project integrates efforts and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events and performs market research on emerging technologies that support all phases of MISO.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs.  Seeks technologies that will transform current MISO capabilities through two major objectives: 1) Exploit technologies capable of disseminating products to reach target audiences across a variety of media to include audiences in denied areas.  2) Automate and improve MISO planning and analytical capability through technologies that are integrated into SOF planning systems (Cultural Analysis, Targeting, Theme Development, Media &amp; Product Selection, Distribution &amp; Dissemination, and Measures of Effectiveness).  Develops software applications that increases the efficiency and shortens the timeline to get MISO dissemination packages approved.  Develops hardware/software tools that facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information and other critical data.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The Distributed Common Ground/Surface System Special Operations Forces (DCGS-SOF) is part of a family of systems providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), and analytical capabilities at the Component/TSOC level and below through a combination of reach back, forward support, and collaboration.  The mission tailored infrastructure interconnects the warfighters, analysts, and sensors to find and fix High Value Targets and provides a network-enabled, interoperable construct allowing continual, unimpeded sharing of intelligence data, information and services with SOF and between the Services, other national intelligence agencies, combatant commands and multi-national partners.  It connects the SOF warfighters and support analysts with essential intelligence information and provides situational awareness information to SOF leadership at all echelons. The three components of DCGS-SOF include the following: The Enterprise All Source Information Fusion (ENT/ASIF) provides infrastructure, processing and intelligence analytical tools capabilities to allow for worldwide SOF intelligence information sharing via a globally connected cloud based architecture as well as a forward disconnected capability. SOF Geospatial Intelligence Processing Exploitation, and Dissemination (SGIP) provides capabilities in garrison and deployed environments of manned and unmanned sensors. SOF Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED) provides SIGINT exploitation capability in both garrison and deployed environments. Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) to accommodate rapid prototyping, may be utilized.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD and Intelligence Community partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate Commercial Off The Shelf /Government Off The Shelf (COTS/GOTS), and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which will reside partially within the SOF Information Enterprise combined with Web-Client tools in a global cloud. These alliances enable more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of larger data domains and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements. The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, Interagency, and Coalition tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by engineering development teams for SOF and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) FADE.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All evolutionary technology insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

USSOCOM is designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small businesses with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific technical merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III is for commercialization of the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 was the first year USSOCOM participated in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program has the additional goal to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF common avionics; Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar, best known as Silent Knight radar or AN/APQ-187; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H/W/U and MC-130E/H/P Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.

SF200 CV-22 Development/Test and Evaluation:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA Silent Knight radar or AN/APQ-187, provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and technology limited TF/TA radar.  There is a plan to develop a Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS), which in combination with the ramp-mounted gun, provides a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress/eliminate enemy targets.  The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the USMC MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar color helmet mounted display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.

S750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, rapid prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

S875 AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Combat Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to rapidly prototype and integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.

D615 Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique rotary wing aviation and training requirements. This project also includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) avionics and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  When possible, Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) may also be used to accommodate rapid prototyping in the above projects to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:

FY 2018:  Net decrease of -$9.282 million is due to a transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs (-$9.525 million), a congressional reduction for excess product development for EW-RFCM (-$7.500 million), a congressional reduction for poor justification materials for CV-22 (-$1.500 million), a congressional reduction for ASE (-$4.000 million), a congressional transfer from Procurement for SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar ($7.500 million), a congressional transfer from Procurement for Degraded Visual Environment ($6.000 million) and a decrease for higher command priorities (-$0.257 million).

FY 2019:  Net decrease of -9.131 million is due to a congressional reduction for insufficient budget justification for EC-130J risk reduction (-1.252 million), a congressional reduction for C-130 SOF Common TF/TA training system development early to need (-$3.879 million), a congressional reduction for PSP High Energy Laser program (-$7.000 million), and a congressional add for VTOL UAS research ($3.000 million).

FY 2020:  Net increase of $108.553 million is for interoperability/compatibility, consolidated testing and airworthiness release for MC-130J AbMN ($2.688 million), for interoperability/compatibility development testing for Integrated Tactical Mission System ($5.438 million), for deficiency resolution and to begin spiral 1 development for EW-RFCM ($30.253 million), for all weather on PSP and Infrared Suppression Systems for SOF C-130s ($17.948 million), for continued development of PSP High Energy Laser ($23.227 million), interoperability/compatibility, consolidated testing and airworthiness release for C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar  ($11.363 million), Rotary Wing Aircraft Survivability increase ($11.425 million) for upgrades to RFCM to address emerging Radio Frequency threats, MH-60 Modifications increase ($4.351 million) for Upturned Exhaust System to reduce vulnerability to IR threats, MH-47 Modifications increase continue Active Parallel Actuator System development, including integration and testing with MH-47G subsystems ($1.860 million).

Schedule: Silent Knight Radar: Raytheon Tiger Team investigation of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) II 2A failures concluded in April 2018; LRIP Radar production resumed in June 2018. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) successfully completed in November 2018.  Fielding decision projected in Q2 FY 2019. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) remains in late Q2 FY 2019.   EC-130J SOF-Unique 7.0/8.1 development delay was due to a delay in the 7.0/8.1 Air Force modification contract.

• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO: This program is being transitioned into the Multi Mission Payload - Heavy (MMP-H) program, PE 1160431BB. MMP-H uses a traditional acquisition development and procurement strategy with accelerated development that includes increased flight test and multiple combat evaluations.

• EW – RFCM:  Awarded delivery order on cost plus incentive fee contract to integrate and test an RFCM System on AC/MC-130J platform.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division as the government Lead System Integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium Other Transactional Authority.  Both of these approaches provide flexibility for rapid prototyping.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls.

• SOF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) Radar:  Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) awarded to Raytheon in January 2017 for development of Software Version (SW ver) 7.14 (outcome of 2017 Limited Users Test).  CPFF award for development of SW ver 7.15 awarded in July 2018, with Qualification Testing expected in 4Q FY19.  Continued software development to improve critical interoperability with other on-aircraft systems in FY19/20 followed by operational capability additions and move to sensor fusion TF FY20-24.

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s C2 and Communications systems as appropriate.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the Joint V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.

CV-22 SOF Common Terrain Following Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) (Silent Knight) Radar: Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas for infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of SOF forces. This more sustainable and capable radar replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar currently integrated on CV-22 aircraft.

Block 20: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, weapons, avionics, survivability, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform. 
Included within Block 20, but not limited to, is the Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS). FDWS provides the CV-22 with the capability to suppress threats in the forward hemisphere while the aircraft is in the critical phase of landing and takeoff at the mission objective. The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the USMC MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar color helmet mounted display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>When possible, rapid prototyping will be incorporated in the acquisition strategies below to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities.

The (Silent Knight) radar was developed by USSOCOM to provide a common TF/TA capability for SOF aircraft. The (Silent Knight) radar replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 TF/TA multimode radar on the CV-22.  The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SF Common TF/TA (Silent Knight) radar program is to procure radar units and radar software modifications through the USSOCOM (Silent Knight) radar Program Management Office, integrate (Silent Knight) radar into CV-22 aircraft, and buy aircraft modification kits, using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.

The Block 20 Forward Defensive Weapon System (FDWS) will be based on modifications to the DWS currently fielded on USMC MV-22 aircraft and previously tested on a CV-22. These modifications will integrate the DWS with the CV-22 pilots’ helmet mounted displays and cockpit controls to correct deficiencies/improve system effectiveness and will award a competitive EMD contract for development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and unmanned aerial systems command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands, Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications perform clandestine or low visibility, single or multi-ship low-level missions intruding politically-sensitive or hostile territories; provide air refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and airdrop of leaflets, insert small special operations teams, resupply bundles and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  An incremental upgrade approach will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to, Airborne Mission Networking, data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

MC-130J AbMN:  Award sole source Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract to develop a battlespace information exchange system for the MC-130J consisting of Government/Commercial-off-the-shelf communications and computing hardware and Government/developmental software.  This approach leverages portions of the AC-130J gunship infrastructure design applicable to the MC-130J.  After completing developmental and operational flight testing, award a sole source contract for Low Rate Initial Production followed by a competitive Firm-Fixed Price contract for production, aircraft integration, and fielding.

ITMS: Develop virtual environment to enable collaborative integration of software services procured through competitive and sole source contracts.  Use of open mission system compliant standards for hardware and software architecture, software, services and future subsystems.

The U.S. Air Force procures the basic AC-130J aircraft under the HC/MC-130J Recapitalization procurement program. USSOCOM will fund development, integration, and testing of capability enhancements for SOF-unique mission equipment using an incremental acquisition strategy.  Multiple contract awards.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.  When possible, Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA Section 804) may be used to accommodate rapid prototyping in the above projects to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This upgrade is necessary to restore structural safety margins and performance margins for the aircrews.  A new integrated airframe shell will address recurring structural failures due to high intensity, high gross weight operations and a decade of battle damage.  A main/tail rotor drive train and engine control improvement effort will reduce airframe loads and restore sufficient safety and performance margins.  An avionics upgrade will replace obsolescent components and provide improved battlefield situational awareness to the aircrew and operators necessary to support time-sensitive mission requirements. This upgrade is critical to keeping the A/MH-6M aircraft operational beyond FY 2020 and until a suitable replacement aircraft is available. The non-recurring effort provides development, fabrication of test hardware, qualification of components and systems, and data collection to support issuance of government airworthiness releases for structural and software modifications.</r2:Description>

These threat systems are technically evolving at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid counter measure system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and pre-planned product improvements (P3I)/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, flares, and associated qualification testing.  P3I upgrades may include, but are not limited to, expansion of frequency ranges on existing systems, modernization of legacy components, and studies directed at potential "collaborative off-boarding/on-boarding" detect/countermeasure capabilities to provide expanded coverage for aircrews in a high threat environment.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three distinct efforts:  integrated airframe, Block 3 performance kits and avionics upgrades.  The airframe efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) by the incumbent contractor.

• MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on MH-60M helicopters.  This includes, but is not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted at SOFSA by the incumbent contractor.

• DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted, resulting in down-selection of one vendor for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

• FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years. 

• IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.  Will begin evaluation and qualification of an infrared exhaust suppressor for the A/MH-6M aircraft.   

• MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS and Engine Barrier Filter.  The upgrades and modifications consist mostly of government and contractor executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed.

• MPU provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.

• The ASE Upgrades program develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment and flares.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, rapid prototyping and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, biometric/forensic site exploitation and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities. USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century. USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons. The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This sub-project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Provides for the identification, development, testing, and rapid prototyping of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces.  Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, and SOF-unique support from space systems, including Tactical Exploitation of National System Capabilities (TENCAP). The systems developed and tested in this line item are National Systems Support to SOF (NSSS); Joint Threat Warning System (JTWS); Hostile Forces - Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (HF-TTL); Special Operations Tactical Video System/Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (TVS/RSTA); Special Operations Forces Planning, Rehearsal and Execution Preparation (SOFPREP); Integrated Survey Program (ISP); and Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE).

U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century. USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons. The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments. The intelligence programs funded in this project will meet annual emergent requirements and are grouped by the level of organizational element they support: Operational Element (Team) and Above Operational Element (Garrison).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This program provides research and development, and rapid prototyping to support HQ SOCOM TENCAP program and associated similar and supporting capabilities. NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by providing innovative space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies and system enhancements, products, and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units.  NSSS leverages current and developmental National systems to integrate with, augment, and support SOCOM systems.  Focus areas include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination. NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid prototype development to transition to SOCOM Programs of Records. These developmental efforts usually support SOCOM’s existing MIPs. NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improving detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection signals, and automating radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using National Technical Means in support of tactical operators.</r2:Description>

Biometric kits allow collection and transmission of unique, measurable biometric signatures from personnel, including live/latent fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features.  It also provides a means to verify against and enroll subjects into the DOD authoritative database, and to query that database to support hold or release decisions. Forensic kits enable on-objective linking of events to specific persons through chemical analysis, latent fingerprints, cell phones and computer data analysis, and deoxyribonucleic acid collection. Exploitation Analysis Centers provide theater-level mobile forensic capabilities for more in-depth exploitation of captured evidence.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, rapid prototyping, testing, and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Special Operation Forces (SOF) must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this PE improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Counter Unmanned Arial Systems (C-UAS) efforts rely on cutting edge detection sensors, both passive and active, paired with kinetic and non-kinetic defeat systems will allow SOF Operators to conduct Special Forces missions in denied and hostile environments worldwide.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  This R-1 program element includes $6.000 million of FY2020 enduring Overseas Contingency Operations funding. 

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and pre-planned product improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project provides for the development, testing, integration, rapid prototyping, and evaluation of specialized equipment, to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF in varied missions; counter-improvised explosive device systems, to meet continually emerging Counter Radio Controlled-Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) threats; C-UAS (aerial, ground and maritime) to mitigate and defeat the emerging and rapidly evolving unmanned system threats; and signature reducing materials and technologies, to reduce the probability of detection by battlefield threat sensors. C-UAS Family of Systems supports the development, integration and testing of Counter Unmanned (Aerial, Ground, Maritime) Sensor Integration Module (SIM) Family of Systems that enhance the Soldier’s ability to detect, track, identify, exploit and defeat specific stand-off unmanned weapon threats, and to acquire objects of military significance before the Soldier is detected and to target threat objects accurately for engagement by soldiers counter-UAS defeat capabilities.

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF and facilitate future Hyper-Enabled Operator capabilities.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices; next generation laser designation and geo-location systems; weapon aiming lasers, scopes and accessories; and training and simulation systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Advanced Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seekers, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software, and missile delivery on to SOF platforms. SOPGM development efforts utilize, to the extent possible, Middle Tier Acquisition methods to rapidly explore, prototype, demonstrate, test, and field new capabilities for near-term combat requirements, such as autonomous and synchronized targeting and strike technology, precision guided projectile ammunition, munition-based aerial sensor delivery vehicles, and alternative precision navigation technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The objective of this program is to research, develop, integrate, generate rapid prototypes, test and evaluate cutting edge Counter-Small Unmanned (Aerial, Ground, Maritime) Systems.  This effort will support a CUAS Sensor Integration Module (SIM) Family of Systems (FoS) that integrates various detection sensor modalities (passive sensors, Radio frequency (RF) detection, acoustic, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), radar, day/night Short-Wave Infrared, Mid-Wave Infrared, Long-Wave Infrared (SWIR/MWIR/LWIR) imaging, etc.) along with defeat systems into a SIM.  The results of this effort will enhance the soldiers ability to detect, track, identify and defeat specific stand-off weapon threats, to acquire objects of military significance before the soldier is detected and to target threat systems accurately for engagement by the soldiers. This system integration will take the man-out-of-the-loop for detection of threat systems and include man-in-the-loop for defeat capabilities. To accomplish this objective, the project will be broken down into the following: (1) technology and concept evaluation, (2) prototype development, and (3) prototype evaluation and assessment.  This program received overseas contingency operations (OCO) funding in FY2019.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Counter Unmanned Aerial System (CUAS): SOF CUAS acquisition strategy is predicated on a layered approach of developing and integrating various advancing detection sensor modalities paired with kinetic and non-kinetic defeat capabilities to include exploitation and digital manipulation technologies. SOF Operators require CUAS capability in hand held, man-portable, mounted and fixed site/expeditionary form factors. SOF CUAS collaborates with the Joint Services, Academia and other government agencies to maintain interoperability and cost effectiveness. As SOF CUAS capabilities are developed for specific SOF mission profiles, centralized life cycle sustainment will be required in support of the SOF Components and Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC). SOF CUAS will utilize Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) for warehousing and sustainment.  

Counter Radio Controlled - Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED):  USSOCOM collaborates with the DoD Joint CREW manager and other government agencies in order to maintain Joint Force compatibility and improve program affordability.  All next generation Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) development designed as National to Theater ("N-to-T") transition programs.  Centralized life cycle sustainment of SOF CREW inventory supports TSOC operational demand as theater provided equipment (TPE).  

Personal Signature Management (PSM):  Signature reducing technologies will be embedded into SOF clothing and equipment via modified commercial-off-the-shelf variants.  Contracts in support of fielding/sustainment of PSM clothing and equipment will be a combination of sole source firm fixed price 5-year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts, Source America mandatory sole sources, small business set asides and prime vendor style multiple award contracts.  PSM will utilize SOFSA for warehousing and sustainment.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC):  Operator &amp; Medic Kits - Program managed by Program Manager-Special Operations Forces Survival, Support, and Equipment Systems (PM-SOF SSES) using US Army Medical Materiel Agency prime vendor contracts for equipment purchases and the SOFSA for warehousing and sustainment.  CASEVAC Set - Program managed by PM-SOF SSES and utilizes and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Commercial-Off-The-Shelf prime integrator contract.  

SPEAR:  Contracts in support of SPEAR are a combination of firm fixed price five year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity with single vendor awards, Source America mandatory sole sources, small business set asides and prime vendor style multiple awards.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4 systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) includes the consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) (previously Program Element (PE) 0304210BB); MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), (previously PE 0305219BB); MQ-8, (previously PE 0305231BB); RQ-11, UAV (previously PE 1105232BB); and RQ-7 UAV, (previously PE 1105233BB).

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Unmanned ISR rapidly develops and deploys special capabilities to perform Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the DOD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of ISR and Targeting capabilities for SOF.  This R-1 program element includes $5.000 million of FY2020 enduring Overseas Contingency Operations funding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). It rapidly develops and deploys special capabilities to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.

Group 1, 2, 3 and 4, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) developmental efforts are to identify, develop, integrate, and test SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements, and modifications to ground control stations. Based on stakeholder input and requirements, Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) develops and integrates UAS payloads to advance ISR capabilities that address dynamic and emergent operational needs of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. This program also provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SAFC acquisition strategy is evolutionary and spiral-based for technology insertion and low volume procurement.  Leverages a Middle Tier Acquisition strategy to provide rapid development and fielding of dynamic and emergent operational needs. SAFC utilizes existing competed contract vehicles to the maximum extent possible for minor development and integration and modification of Government-Off-The-Shelf/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf equipment. It utilizes limited/full and open competition contracts for major developments.

The Group 1 UAS/EOTACS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through a thorough stakeholder's analysis in order to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Group 2 MTUAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, training systems, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through a middle tier acquisition strategy that includes a thorough stakeholder's analysis to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field. Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the OEM.

Group 3 UAS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through a thorough stakeholder's analysis in order to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field.

Group 4 UAS is an evolutionary acquisition program that develops, tests, and integrates SOF peculiar emerging technology mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-1C UAVs, GCS, and training systems. Group 4 UAS provides rapid prototype activities and technology maturation events to increase situational awareness and lethality. Contract types include a mix of cost type and fixed price. Proprietary issues with the aircraft and GCS software as well as aircraft modification considerations dictate sole source contracts. Group 4 UAS leverages service common Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and developmental activities and contracts for aircraft and ancillary equipment development, improvement, and sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Designs and tests an electric version of the GMV1.1 allowing a reduced audible signature on future missions with an additional goal of reducing the logistical footprint (less moving parts, no fuel and oils required, etc.). Develops a purpose built NSCV and move the design into testing.  This effort will reduce future lifecycle costs and improve capability for SOF operators. Furthermore, FSOV will integrate and test designated Counter-UAS/Precision Strike systems on vehicle platforms to ensure performance of both systems with minimal adverse impacts.  Additional technology insertion efforts will be addressed such as ECPs, armor upgrades, and lightweight vehicle/armor efforts.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) of Special Operations Forces (SOF) Surface and Undersea Mobility platforms.  This program element also provides for pre-acquisition activities to quickly respond to new requirements for SOF surface and undersea mobility, looking at multiple alternatives to include cross-platform technical solutions, service-common solutions, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf technologies, and new development efforts.  Middle-Tier Acquisition (2016 NDAA, Section 804) to accommodate rapid prototyping, may be utilized.

The Underwater Systems project provides for EMD of combat submersibles, SOF operator diving systems, underwater support systems, and underwater equipment. This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (material solutions analysis, advanced component, prototype development, and exploitation of emerging technology opportunities to deliver enhanced capabilities) to respond to emergent requirements. These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions. The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.

The Surface Craft project provides for EMD of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  This project element also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

•  SWCS used full and open competition with a down select to a single contractor.  The full spectrum of contracting activities are being utilized for any integration and subsystem requirements, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies, and new contracts as necessary. 

•  DCS used full and open competition, resulting in the selection of a single prime contractor.  A Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target contract for a production representative system was awarded in FY 2016 with options to procure one vessel in FY 2018 and one in FY 2019.  DCS-Next is planned to be a full and open competition beginning in FY 2020 with market research.   

•  The DDS is currently in sustainment through a maintenance and service contract which was competitively sourced, and awarded for a 5-year period. The modernization and engineering/change efforts for the six DDS in inventory are executed utilizing the existing services contract.  

•  SOF Combat Diving is designated a Middle-Tier acquisition program which supports rapid prototyping and is executed using existing contracts, government agencies, and new contracts competitively selected as appropriate.  

•  UCME will use streamlined FAR contracting with existing or planned IDIQ, Blanket Order Agreement (BOA), UARC, and FFRDC contracts and use Non-FAR Based Acquisition Authorities and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, where appropriate. UCME focuses on developing specific technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility for transition to SOF undersea craft.

•  CCM was a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistic support.  

•  CCH SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from United States Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity.  SEALION III is Sole Source to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.  

•  CCME emphasizes on spearheading Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 technology for successful transition into SOF Combatant Craft. CCME accomplishes this by employing the full spectrum of contracting services, using existing contracts where appropriate, and leveraging from other Government agencies to include the Services and USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L Science &amp; Technology Directorate. CCME focuses on developing the technology for maturity, marinization and compatibility, finally transitioning to the craft.

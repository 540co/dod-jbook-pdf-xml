            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program includes support for multidisciplinary basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines that enables the U.S. Navy to maintain technological superiority and for the university research infrastructure to acquire the research instrumentation needed to maintain and improve the quality of university research important to the Navy. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) efforts involve teams of researchers investigating high priority topics and opportunities that intersect more than one traditional technical discipline. For many military problems this multidisciplinary approach serves to stimulate innovation, accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results into Naval applications. The Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP)  supports university research infrastructure essential to high quality, Navy-relevant research. The instrumentation program complements other Navy research programs by supporting the purchase of high cost research instrumentation that is necessary to carry out cutting-edge research. The program supports Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single investigator research efforts performed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in their research careers. This program provides the knowledge base, scientific concepts, and technological advances for the maintenance of Naval power and national security.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>DEFENSE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION PROGRAM (DURIP)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>DURIP funds are provided to universities to purchase relatively high cost research instrumentation that is normally not included in single-investigator type research grants. Individual grants range from $50K to $1.5M. Funding for DURIP efforts be awarded after the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. In turn, universities need to purchase the instrumentation and take delivery before any billings are generated. It frequently takes several months for delivery and billing to be completed. DURIP is a one-year program.</r2:Description>

MURI topics are selected to address Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Framework Priorities as described in the Naval Research and Development Framework. Funding for MURI efforts are awarded after OSD announces the awardees, which typically takes place towards the second half of the fiscal year. Since the MURI program funds academic researchers, execution of the efforts typically ramp up during the summer academic break months. MURI projects make significant contributions to Navy and DoD objectives by speeding up scientific programs, by cross-fertilization of ideas, by hastening the transition of basic research to practical applications, and by training students in cross-disciplinary approaches to science and engineering research of importance to DoD. MURI projects are five year programs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This University Research Initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted by universities and supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs. The initiative is a collection of specialized research programs performed by academic research institutions. Individual project metrics are tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. Example metrics include extending the life of Thermal Barrier Coatings for transition to the Enterprise and Platform Enablers Future Naval Capability program. It is projected that the life time of Thermal Barrier Coating on Turbine Blades can be doubled. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national-security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences, and is the core of Discovery and Invention. Basic research projects are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research in technology and capability-related 'thrusts' which are consolidated in thirteen Naval Research and Development Framework focus areas: Power and Energy; Operational Environments; Maritime Domain Awareness; Asymmetric and Irregular Warfare; Information, Analysis and Communication; Power Projection; Assure Access and Hold at Risk; Distributed Operations; Naval Warfighter Performance and Protection; Survivability and Self-Defense; Platform Mobility; Fleet/Force Sustainment; Affordability, Maintainability and Reliability.

The In-House Laboratory Independent Research Program provides participating Naval Warfare Centers and Laboratories with funding for: basic research to develop and maintain a cadre of active researchers who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to solve Naval problems; promoting hiring and development of new scientists; and encouragement of collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Defense laboratories.

ILIR efforts are selected by Naval Warfare Centers/Lab Commanding Officers and Technical Directors near the start of each Fiscal Year through internal competition. Efforts typically last three years, and are generally designed to assess the promise of new lines of research. Successful efforts attract external, competitively awarded funding. Because the Warfare Centers and Labs encompass the full range of naval technology interests, the scope of ILIR topics roughly parallels that of PE 0601153N, Defense Research Science.

This PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority by providing new technological concepts for the maintenance of Naval power and national security, by helping to avoid scientific surprise while exploiting scientific breakthroughs, and by providing options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). The research aligns to the Naval Research and Development Framework for long term Navy and Marine Corps improvements and is in consonance with future warfighting concepts and doctrine developed at the Naval Warfare Development Command and the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It enables technologies that significantly improve the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Future Joint Warfighting Capabilities. The In-house Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) program also adds increased emphasis to the revitalization of the scientist and engineer workforce component at the Navy's Warfare Centers and Laboratories by attracting superior candidates and retaining our best members through the provision of exciting and meaningful work.


Due to the number of efforts in PE 0601152N, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The In-house Laboratory Independent Research initiative seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through the Naval Warfare Centers/Laboratories. It also supports the development of technical intellect and education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in a military laboratory environment. Initial research focus is often conducted in an unfettered environment since it is basic research, but many projects focus on applying recently developed theoretical knowledge to real world military problems with the intention of developing new capabilities and improving the performance of existing systems. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's Congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the Department of Defense is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses basic research efforts including scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in national security related aspects of physical, engineering, environmental and life sciences. Basic research efforts are developed, managed, and related to more advanced aspects of research on the order of a hundred technology and capability-related 'thrusts', which are consolidated into about fifteen research areas.  These in turn support the major research areas of the Navy and Marine Corps: Autonomous Systems; Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning; Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4); Marine as a System; Information Analysis and Decision Support; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; Logistics; Materials; Operational Environments; Platforms; Power and Energy Technology; Sensors and Electronics; Warrior Performance and Protection; Weapons and Support (Education and Outreach).

This PE sustains U.S. Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) superiority, provides new technological concepts for the maintenance of naval power and national security, and helps avoid scientific surprise. It is based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It exploits scientific breakthroughs and provides options for new Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs) and Innovative Naval Prototypes (INPs).  

S&amp;T investment in basic research also includes the National Naval Responsibilities (NNRs), fields upon which a wide range of fundamental Naval capabilities depend. There are currently five NNRs.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Efforts are underway to understand the interactions of physics between the atmosphere, space, land, ocean and ice, represent these coupled processes in models, and extend them across scales from local to planetary, with the goal extending the skill of predictions to longer timescales (i.e. seasonal to interannual). Recent efforts have also focused on the processes that control tropical cyclone formation, structure and intensity changes and phenomena that affect electromagnetic and electro-optic propagation in the marine atmosphere.

                                <r2:Description>The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats (SAHT) (formerly Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED)) Sciences program provides research for Naval Forces to fight hybrid threats, and adversaries in expeditionary operations. Naval Expeditionary Forces need science advances to address a range of Basic Research challenges that result from physical and operational environmental limitations so harsh that solutions push basic discovery and invention. Naval Forces able to operate amphibiously and in the littoral will have all of their capabilities exposed to degrading sea and land physical effects. Expeditionary forces operating austerely must be agile and lethal but will be constrained by size, weight, and power requirements and must be sustained across distributed forces covering large areas. Further complicating the problem context is the nature of hybrid threats, and adversaries. A hybrid adversary can be state or non-state using a combination of conventional and irregular methods and weapons. For example a hybrid threat could use criminal acts in concert with conventional artillery and IEDs and in turn social media for combined effects greater and broader than the sum of the parts. These coordinated multivariate threats occur across the spectrum of conflict with a dynamic but unified strategy. A hybrid adversary is flexible and adapts quickly, synchronizing advanced state weapons systems, disruptive commercial technologies, cheap expedient homemade weapons, and a variety of tactics. The Sciences Addressing Hybrid Threats program seeks to establish and nurture science to address these threats not covered in more conventional warfare science efforts and in environments not researched elsewhere.

Within the above threat and environmental context numerous warfighting capability dependencies are considered resulting in a broad range of science research areas. Examples include: physics addressing the electromagnetic spectrum for use in Command and Control and high energy physics addressing Directed Energy Weapons; machine perception, reasoning and collaborative behaviors of autonomy enabling numerous potential expeditionary autonomous systems; artificial intelligence enabling future Intelligence systems; optics, electronics, and photonics research to enable revolutionary spectral awareness in small low power sensors; computer and network science to enable expeditionary computing coupled with Data Science research to conduct data analysis; fundamental chemistry and materials science research to advance technologies to support sustainment; basic materials research to explore and improve armor and structural materials; electrochemical energy conversion and storage research to sustain the force; chemistry and physics to provide disruptive energetics for expeditionary Fires; and biology, physiology, and cognitive sciences addressing the Naval Expeditionary warfighters human abilities.

The program also seeks to establish and nurture a multidisciplinary Science and Technology community of Government, academic and industry researchers to accelerate the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.

Some examples of ongoing studies are (1) uncovering the physical, chemical, optical and biological phenomena in the nanometer scale, (2) understanding the effect of coatings on the conductions of ions and electrons, (3) developing better understanding on the performance of spin-polarized electrons for advanced electronic switches and memories, (4) developing fundamental understanding of electron transfer and carbon fixation pathways in microbial consortia and relate them to energy harvesting, material synthesis ans sensing, (5) understanding the mechanism of bioactuation for novel would healing applications, biocatalysis for mitigation and sensing, biocorrosion/fouling for improving operational efficiency and reducing operational maintanace cost, (6) computational capabilities to understand the microstructures/defects in metals and alloys of Naval interest, computational fluid dymnamics simulations for jet engine noise reduction, flapping wing design to hypersonics. Several accomplishments have been demonstrated for materials using 3D printing, mobility of electrons of one spin, design of microbial cells to extract power from the coastal ocean sediments.

Initiate studies using remote sensing of the coastal and riverine environment, above and below the sea surface and canopy, e.g., from EO, IR, radar, SAR, inSAR and acoustic, from land or ship-based, unmanned vehicles, airplanes or satellites.

Extramural Marine Mammals and Biology

Integrated Ecosystem Research - Conduct basic research to understand the patterns and causes of variability in the distribution and abundance of marine mammals over space and time. Initiate a multidisciplinary approach using tagging, visual surveys, and passive acoustics to collect baseline measures of marine mammal behaviors and distributions relative to environmental features and marine mammal prey fields. Investigate using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors and distributions of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic).  This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern.

Effects of Sound - Conduct basic research on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to "biologically significant" behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and/or bodies.  Another research focus is better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Conduct research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and 'biologically significant' disturbance. Continue research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.

Monitoring and Detection - Conduct research to develop and test new and existing technology to detect and classify marine mammals in the marine environment and during periods of low light such as passive acoustics, and IR. Continue research and development of passive acoustic signal processing algorithms for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. Continue the development and testing of autonomous hardware platforms using passive acoustics and/or IR to detect and classify marine mammals using a variety of fixed, towed, floating, and profiling platforms.

Areas of research include: shallow-water scattering mechanisms related to reverberation and clutter; seabed acoustic measurements supporting geoacoustic inversion; acoustic propagation through internal waves and coastal ocean processes and the development of unified ocean/seabed/acoustic models, including scattering from rough surfaces, biologics and bubbles; and penetration/propagation within the porous seafloor.

Intramural Battlespace Environments

The overall objective of this research is to improve basic understanding of physical, seafloor and biological oceanographic processes on space and time scales of naval interest. Emphasis is on improved measurements, laboratory and model based experiments to quantify and understand important oceanographic processes that lead to the development of ocean dynamic models from global to submesoscale scales, and to couple these oceanographic models with atmospheric, ice, biological, sediment response, and optical models. Surveillance of coastal land areas and waters is important to support Navy operations and difficult. The Navy/Marine Corps needs include an improved use of overhead (airborne and satellite) active and passive microwave sensors, overhead optical sensors, surface-based (ships and ground-based) grazing angle microwave sensors. To predict bottom boundary physical, geological, geochemical, geoacoustic and geotechnical properties in shallow-water operating areas requires:  a) an improved understanding of processes that generate and modify the shape, structure and physical properties of the seafloor, subseafloor, ocean water column and ice-cover and topography/morphology;  b) use of rapid, airborne characterization of littoral environments including time-varying coastal topography, littoral bathymetry, sea-level height, land and seafloor sedimentary structures to explain/predict the observed changes; c) remote sensing of bulk properties of Arctic sea-ice over broad two-dimensional areas that previously could be sampled only at spot locations by in-situ sampling; and d) quantification of the influence of turbulence generated at the seafloor boundary layer on vertical mixing and stratification in shallow water outside the surf zone.</r2:Text>

This includes providing a context for interpreting behavioral responses to external stimuli (i.e. anthropogenic sound), and providing basic knowledge needed for predictive models of species of concern.

Effects of Sound
 
Basic research on behavioral, physiological (hearing and stress response), and potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Research to characterize the causal chain of events leading from sound exposure to "biologically significant" behavioral reactions that might increase risks of population-level effects and/or the potential for stranding. An additional focus is to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Research the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Initiate research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and/or bodies. Another research focus is to better understand the stress response in marine mammals to sound exposure. Research an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize the relationships among hormones or other biomarkers in different matrices, define and compare the quantitative and temporal relationships of hormones across the different matrices, and evaluate and characterize the relationship between the physiological stress response in marine mammals and acoustic exposure and 'biologically significant' disturbance. Research to develop statistical models of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance to be fitted to data from marine mammal populations and lead collaborative development of transferable models of the effects of disturbance on marine mammals.

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Defense Basic Research seeks to improve the quality of defense research conducted predominantly through universities and government laboratories. It also supports the education of engineers and scientists in disciplines critical to national defense needs through the development of new knowledge in an academic environment. Initial research focus is generally conducted in an unfettered environment because of the nature of basic research, but as more is learned and applications emerge, individual research projects take on a more applied focus. Individual project metrics then become more tailored to the needs of specific applied research and advanced development programs. Example metrics include a biporous wick structure for thermal management of power electric modules capable of removing 900 watts per square centimeter which was recently developed by an academia/industry team. The National Research Council of the National Academies of Science and Engineering's congressionally directed "Assessment of Department of Defense Basic Research" concluded that the DoD is managing its basic research program effectively.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework.  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE supports both advanced technology research and near to mid-term transition opportunities.  The advanced research focus is primarily on directed energy, high speed weapon propulsion, and electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor technologies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>This Program Element (PE) develops early component technologies that can be integrated into weapon systems that meet warfighter requirements.  Most of the work in this PE can be classified between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 2 (technology concept and/or application formulation) and TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environments).  The metrics used to evaluate 6.2 programs are necessarily less precise than those used in 6.3 programs. 

The metrics for this PE can be divided into two categories:  technological and organizational/functional.  Technological metrics address the success of the work performed.  The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve laboratory experiments/tests demonstrating proof of the concept for the technology.  This demonstration is frequently a hand-assembled functioning breadboard of the concept.  The organizational/functional metrics applied to this PE include:  transition of the technology to advanced development in a 6.3 PE and applicability of the technology to documented warfighter problems or requirements.  Successful implementation of these categories would result in the application of a pass/fail metric and further evaluation for possible transition to a 6.3 development/demonstration program.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The activities described in this program element (PE) address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

This PE addresses applied research associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy.  It supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms.  The goal is to provide the ability to win or avoid engagements with other platforms or weapons and, in the event of engagement, to resist and control damage while preserving operational capability.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment directly supports the Theater Air and Missile Defense transformational capability required by Sea Shield and the Ship to Objective Maneuver key transformational capability.  This is accomplished by improvements in platform offensive performance, stealth, and self-defense.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Current small platforms (both surface and airborne) have little to no situational awareness (SA) or self-protection against air, surface, and asymmetric threats.  A goal of this activity is to provide these platforms with effective self-protection.  The technology areas specific to platform protection will develop individual, multispectral electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF), electro-magnetic (EM), visual and acoustic or chemical sensors/biosensors and associated processing.  To defend platforms from current and advanced threats in at-sea littoral environments and in port, these technologies must improve multispectral detection and distribution of specific threat information.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses demand signals emphasized by the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Chief of Naval Research, as well as those pulled from dynamic engagement with stakeholders. Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.

As reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, Expeditionary Forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. 

These future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Post limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. 

The approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both "push" and "pull" aspects of technology projects. Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates robust, resilient, and secure networked communications pathways and capability that support an expeditionary force's distributed and disaggregated operations. Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commiserate within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyber attacks.

Technologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Across the three technology investment areas of 'Warrior Resilience' (WR), 'Decision Making and Expertise Development' (DMED), and Operational Tools (OT) research will continue to focus on providing small unit leaders with effective training and tools to gain them the winning edge on the battlefield. These capabilities will provide information to the warfighter at the point of friction and with increased information flow ("the right information, presented the right way, at the right time") to aid cognitive reasoning about the effects of the battlefield - whether physical or physiological - and mitigation of negative aspects of combat. The WR portfolio will fund research into further understanding the necessity, and ability, to train front-line (infantry) troops for maximum performance. The DMED portfolio will research and implement state-of-the-art and science of learning-based training techniques to improve the development of small unit decision making expertise. The Operational Tools portfolio will increase the ability of the warfighter to process information and speed decision making by implementing novel data collection techniques (multi-spectral collection of signals across the electro-optical spectrum) and processing of these inputs for display - in real time, as the ultimate goal - directly to the individual who requires the information to make a timely, accurate decision.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Title>USMC FNC TECHNOLOGY CANDIDATES</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity, formerly named USMC Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs), addresses the applied research associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The objective of the work in this Program Element (PE) is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD) that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0602750N Future Naval Capabilities Applied Research, where the Navy's participation in the FNC Program is funded.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, are being resourced in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD).  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. 

Prior to FY19, the underlying FNC Program investments in this PE were aligned to specific FNC projects.  In order to increase agility, exploit technology advances, and respond quickly to naval needs, future applied research investments supporting FNC technology candidates are being developed in a more flexible manner. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that will be developed further in PE 0603640M Marine Corps Advanced Technology Development (ATD). The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors.  

A complete accounting of the technologies being developed in this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:Description>

Logistics replaces mass with assured knowledge and speed, is equally capable ashore or afloat in austere environments, and is fully scalable to meet uncertain requirements.  This includes efficient and responsive force sustainment, planning and directing logistics operations, logistics demand reduction, fleet maintenance, and expeditionary energy.  Expeditionary Energy enhances combat capability of expeditionary warfighters by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of energy production, storage, distribution and use. Beyond traditional energy efforts, this portfolio also looks at other issues, including energy-efficient behaviors and hybridization of energy sources. These pillars are thoroughly integrated and perpetually related in execution.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment. The mission area requirements for rapid, accurate decision-making; dynamic, efficient, mission-focused communications and networks; and pervasive and persistent sensing drive network centric S&amp;T investments. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The activities described in this Program Element (PE) address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise (NER) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

Activities and efforts in this program examine concepts and technologies that enable the transformation to network centric warfare. Network centric capabilities rely on information to connect assets and provide timely and accurate understanding of the environment.

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop high throughput dynamic wireless communications and network technologies critical to the mission performance and robustness of naval communications for widely dispersed, mobile air, land, surface and submerged platforms.  These platforms are often Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) limited, and will operate under constraints of cluttered Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, harsh Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) and Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) conditions.  The technical payoff is increased network data rates, interoperability across heterogeneous radios, dynamic bandwidth management, and greater mobile network connectivity.  The operational payoff is that warfighters from the operational command to the tactical edge have near real-time access to information, knowledge and decision-making necessary to perform their tasks, including coalition and allied forces.  Emphasis is on tactical edge communications and networks to fully realize net-centric warfare, bridging the Global Information Grid (GIG) and the 'disadvantaged user', e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned vehicles, distributed sensors and ground units in urban and RF challenged environments.  

The current specific objectives are:

- Radios and Apertures: Develop technologies for high band radio, electrically-small and actively scanned antennas, addressing critical issue of radio spectrum bandwidth efficiency, spectrum contention and clutter, agile frequency communications with dynamic spectrum access, all-digital front-end with wide dynamic range, power amplifier efficiency, multipath effects, saltwater propagation and BLOS communications. Develop algorithms and signal processing for space-time-frequency diversity communications, including measures for electronic protection, such as low-intercept, antijam waveforms and modulation.  Develop affordable antenna technologies for small size and weight, high radiation efficiency, and wideband operation with rapid beam-steering.  Develop alternatives to RF communications in airborne and terrestrial environments as well as high data rate underwater communications for undersea warfare (distributed sensor netting, unmanned underwater vehicle data exfiltration, submarine Communications at Speed and Depth) using electro-optic/infra-red (EO/IR) technologies.  Develop secure, high bandwidth communications systems and the exploitation of existing and emerging network protocols that will avail development of new, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based data transport mechanisms.

- Tactical Networking and Network Control/Management: 
Develop advanced networking techniques for robust, highly dynamic environments; interoperable networks for secure communications and protocols, bandwidth and network management techniques that manage and allocate bandwidth across tactical and theater levels in support of net-centric operations. Develop rapidly auto-configuring and self-organizing networks with efficient and survivable routing, secure authentication, mobility management and Quality-of-Service guarantee, while optimizing network resources.  Address low bandwidth, synchronization and reliability for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)/middleware architecture in both mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) and infrastructure-based Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. Develop cognitive network planning and operations engines whose criteria are based directly on mission objectives, while self-adapting and managing the spectrum allocation and radio resources in such a way that network operations, SOA community of interest, and computer network defense are integrated to form a single common tactical network picture that requires a minimum of human intervention and skill.</r2:Description>

New algorithmic approaches are being developed to conduct automatic target recognition using associative learning.  A small sized design has been built to improve Radio Frequency (RF) detection of targets at High Frequency (HF) frequencies as precursors to adversary air attacks.  This in conjunction with improvements being made in HF surface wave radar array geometries should greatly improve operational capabilities in this reinvigorated part of the RF spectrum.  A new concept for rapidly assessing concurrently multiple missiles with multiple Electronic Warfare (EW) responses is being investigated to provide for rapid high quality assessment in this complex environment.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports innovation-based efforts that will provide technology options for future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities. Efforts focus on advanced Naval materials; biocentric technologies; environmental quality; human factors and organizational design; medical technologies; and Naval training technologies. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment maps to future transformational capabilities and the FORCEnet pillar of the CNO and the Commandant of the Marine Corps vision for the future -- Naval Power 21. 

This PE supports the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Global mission to serve as the preeminent external facilitator for the Naval Research Enterprise.  This is accomplished by establishing quality, relevant connections between the international research and development community, Naval fleet/forces, DOD, other US Government agencies and international partners.

The efforts described in this Program Element PE are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval Research and Development Framework which is developed from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH GLOBAL</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Supports the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Global mission to serve as the preeminent external facilitator for the Naval Research Enterprise.  This is accomplished by establishing quality, relevant connections between the international research and development community, Naval fleet/forces, DOD, other US Government agencies and international partners.

Science Advisors (SA):  This effort ensures that the operational Naval fleet/force help shape the DON investment in science and technology (S&amp;T), develops teaming relationships to rapidly prototype, experiment, demonstrate and transition technology, supports development of technology-based capability options for Naval forces, and enables warfighting innovations based on technical and conceptual possibilities. The SA Program also informs capability-based war games using current and future technology to identify future capability strengths and shortfalls that assist in shaping the DON investment strategy. The ONR Global SA Program enables continuous communication and collaboration between the warfighters, the Naval Research &amp; Development Enterprise, and strategic development commands. 
 
INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE: The ONR Global mission is also accomplished through PhD-level scientists located in Asia, Europe and South America, providing coverage in these regions as well as Africa, Australia/New Zealand and the Middle East. ONR Global scientists actively search the globe for emerging scientific research and promising technologies, collaborating with international organizations and researchers through liaison visits and grants in innovative applied research. The direct impact of this investment is to leverage international research during increasingly dynamic global interdependence and improve the ability to solve DON S&amp;T challenges through shared knowledge and technologies with partners. In addition, this investment builds global S&amp;T awareness to reduce the risk of potential technological surprise, and supports theater security cooperation goals to sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners. 

INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT: ONR Global also supports international engagement with partner nations through the development and maintenance of bilateral and multilateral relationships, international agreements, and other activities that promote RDT&amp;E collaboration and interoperability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The activities described in this Program Element (PE) address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

The Electromagnetic Systems Applied Research Program addresses technology needs associated with Naval platforms for new capabilities in Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) Sensors, Surveillance, Electronic Warfare, Navigation, Solid State Electronics, Vacuum Electronics Power Amplifiers, and Nanoelectronics. The program supports development of technologies to enable capabilities in Missile Defense, Directed Energy, Platform Protection, Time Critical Strike, and Information Distribution. This program directly supports the Department of Defense Joint Warfighter Plan and the Defense Technology Area Plans. Activities and efforts within this Program have attributes that focus on enhancing the affordability of warfighting systems. The program also provides for technology efforts to maintain proactive connectivity and collaboration between Department Of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and Joint, Navy, and Marine Corps commands worldwide.  

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop technologies that enable the development of affordable, effective and robust Electronic Warfare (EW) systems across the entire Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) that will increase the operational effectiveness and survivability of U.S. Naval units.  Emphasis is placed on passive sensors and active and passive Countermeasure (CM) systems that exploit and counter a broad range of electromagnetic threats. The focus is on maintaining near perfect, real-time knowledge of the enemy; countering the threat of missiles against deployed Naval forces; precision identification and location of threat emitters; and development of technologies that have broad application across multiple disciplines within the EW mission area. This activity also includes developments to protect these technologies from external interference, and modeling and simulation required to support the development of these technologies. Also included is technology development in support of the Integrated Distributed Electronic Warfare System (IDEWS) concept. The current objectives are: 

- EW Radio Frequency (RF) Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the RF spectrum (covering frequencies from kilohertz to terahertz) that include developments in detection, signal processing and passive/active techniques for wideband Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP) and the Electronic Support (ES) mission areas. 

- EW Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies in the EO/IR spectral domain (extending from the ultraviolet to the far infrared spectral bands) that include advances in multispectral sensors, multiband sources, beam forming/steering, and signal processing and transmission. 

- EW Integrated and Networked Technology: Develop and demonstrate technologies that will enable an increased situational awareness and response across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) with broad spatial coverage using all available EW assets to provide coordinated, adaptive and networked EW sensing, protection and attack. 

- Advanced EW Enabling Technologies: Develop classified advanced electronic warfare technology in support of current and predicted capability requirements. 

- Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare Command &amp; Control (EMC2) (FY16-FY20): Enable a battle group to work cooperatively in the EM Spectrum (EMS) to optimize Electronic Warfare (EW), Information Operations (IO), Communications (Comms) and Radar performance. EMC2 will build upon the Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) that was previously developed for single multifunction systems under the InTop program to optimize spectrum and functional use across a platform and an entire battle group.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>The Electromagnetic Warfare applied research being conducted includes efforts in both Radio Frequency (RF) countermeasures and Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) Countermeasure including both detection and defeat.  Technology developments to provide capabilities indigenous to small UASs are a significant focus.  Technology developments being addressed include laser based Infrared (IR) countermeasures, non-mechanical holographic means for optical beam steering for EO/IR countermeasures, the development of new optical lens technologies based on Gradient Indexed (GRIN) optics. This latter technology when coupled with another ongoing effort in multidimensional optics show significant promise for greatly reducing the weight of highly capable optical systems.  Additionally, there is a focus on developing the high payoff technology of chip scaled integration of optical photonic components with microwave components.   Technology is being investigated to determine the potential for being able to conduct specific emitter identification and classification relative to gun blasts using IR imagers.   

RF efforts include work in developing engineered high transmit to receiver materials for significant improvements in isolation.  Work is ongoing to expand Electronic Warfare (EW) jamming capabilities at high power levels covering previously unaddressed frequency bands with significant operational impact.  The technologies to permit operations of EW attack in friendly communications bands without attendant fratricide is being researched using alternative technology approaches over current approaches.  Cognitive electronic attack approaches in both the communications bands and radar bands are ongoing to address the need to address and defeat unidentified RF pop-up threats.  Results have been obtained in ongoing research in metamaterials in the RF domain.

Completed development of Infrared GRIN optics and associated SWaP advantages for multispectral imagers in a prototype system.

Starting in FY 2018, all INP and LA-Tech investments in EMC2 Warfare will be shown in the new INP Program Element (PE) 0602792N INP Applied Research to better convey exactly what the Office of Naval Research (ONR) is working on in this area.</r2:Text>

Infrared (IR) and terahertz technologies are being modified and integrated with the expectations that combining these two technologies an effective solution can be obtained.  Bistatic radar and imaging technology is being developed to extend surveillance capabilities and passively engage targets.  A unique approach permitting rapid active scanning of a battlefield in the IR domain using a non-mechanically scanned mechanism is under development.  This technology if successful will eliminate the multiple laser ball systems currently required to accomplish this same requirement at lower SWAP.  Active work is also being focused on developing capabilities for high resolution, wide field of view sensors on modest sized UAS platforms.

A unique approach permitting rapid active scanning of a battlefield in the IR domain using a non-mechanically scanned mechanism is under development.  This technology if successful will eliminate the multiple laser ball systems currently required to accomplish this same requirement at lower SWAP.  Active work is also being focused on developing capabilities for high resolution, wide field of view sensors for modest sized UAS platforms.  A promising development using holographic-based optical phase conjugation to provide a wide field of view Electro-Optic and Infrared (EO/IR) countermeasures to detect, track and/or jam imaging sensors.  An effort is expanding the state of the art in a Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) multispectral LIDAR system capable of simultaneous 4D (x,y,z,?) spatial-spectral information for imaging and spectral discrimination through obscurations to provide improved battlespace awareness through a revolutionary multi-functional electro-optical system for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, target detection and classification.

                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop higher performance components and subsystems for all classes of military Radio-Frequency (RF) systems that are based on solid state physics phenomena and are enabled by improved understanding of these phenomena, new circuit design concepts and devices, and improvements in the properties of electronic materials. An important subclass are the Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), Microwave (MW), and Millimeter Wave (MMW) power amplifiers for Navy all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, communications, and smart weapon systems. Another subclass are the analog and high speed, mixed signal components that connect the electromagnetic signal environment into and out of digitally realized, specific function systems. These improved components are based on both silicon (Si) and compound semiconductors (especially the wide bandgap materials and narrow bandgap materials), low and high temperature superconductors, novel nanometer scale structures and materials. Components addressed by this activity emphasize the MMW and Submillimeter Wave (SMMW) regions with an increasing emphasis on devices capable of operating in the range from 50 Gigahertz (GHz) to 10 terahertz (THz). The functionality of the technology developed cannot be obtained through Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, linearity, operational and instantaneous bandwidth, weight, and size. Effort will involve understanding the properties of engineered semiconductors as they apply to quantum information science and technology. This activity also includes Anti-Tamper development of innovative techniques and technologies to deter the reverse engineering and exploitation of our military's critical technology and critical program information in order to impede technology transfer and alteration of system capability and prevent the development of countermeasures to U.S. systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>VACUUM ELECTRONICS POWER AMPLIFIERS</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The overarching objective of this activity is to develop Millimeter Wave (MMW) and sub-MMW power amplifiers for use in Naval all-weather radar, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic attack, and communications systems.  The technology developed cannot, for the most part, be obtained through Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) as a result of the simultaneous requirements placed on power, frequency, bandwidth, weight, and size.  Responding to strong interests from the various user communities, efforts are focused on the development of technologies for high-data-rate communications, electronic warfare and high-power radar applications at MMW and upper-MMW regime.  The emphasis is placed on achieving high power at high frequency in a compact form factor.  Technologies include utilization of spatially distributed electron beams in amplifiers, such as sheet electron beams and multiple-beams, and creation of simulation based design methodologies based on physics-based and geometry driven design codes.

The current specific objectives are:

- High Power Millimeter and Upper Millimeter Wave Amplifiers: Develop science and technology for high power millimeter and upper millimeter wave amplifiers including high current density diamond cathodes, sheet and multiple electron beam formation and mode suppression techniques in overmoded structures.

- Lithographic Fabrication Techniques: Develop lithographic fabrication techniques for upper-millimeter wave amplifiers.

- Accurate and Computationally Effective Device-Specific Multi-Dimensional Models for Electron Beams: Develop accurate and computationally effective device-specific multi-dimensional models for electron beam generation, large-signal and stability analysis to simulate device performance and improve the device characteristics.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The activities described in this program element (PE) address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

This PE provides the unique, fundamental programmatic instrument by which basic research on the natural environment is transformed into technological developments that provide new or enhanced warfare capabilities for the Battlespace Environment (BSE).  The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and applying environmental factors affecting naval material and operations in the BSE.  This program provides for BSE technological developments that contribute to meeting top joint warfare capabilities established by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with primary emphasis on Joint Littoral Warfare and Joint Strike Warfare. 

This PE fully supports the Director of Defense Research and Engineering's Science and Technology Strategy and is coordinated with other DoD Components through the Defense Science and Technology Reliance process.  Work in this program is related to and fully coordinated with efforts in accordance with the on-going Reliance joint planning process.  There is close coordination with the US Air Force and US Army under the Reliance program in the BSE categories of Lower Atmosphere, Ocean Environments, Space &amp; Upper Atmosphere, and Terrestrial Environments.  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, the investment will contribute toward achieving each of the "key transformational capabilities" required by Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing.  Moreover, environmental information, environmental models, and environmental tactical decision aids that emerge from this investment will form one of the essential components of FORCEnet (which is the architecture for a highly adaptive, human-centric, comprehensive maritime system that operates from seabed to space).  The Navy program includes efforts that focus on, or have attributes that enhance, the affordability of warfighting systems.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides technologies that form the natural environment technical base on which all systems development and advanced technology depend.  Furthermore, this technical base provides developments that may be utilized in the Future Naval Capabilities programs: Organic Mine Countermeasures (MCM) and Autonomous Operations. This project contains the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) (Title II, subtitle E, of Public Law 104-201) and efforts aimed
at understanding and predicting the impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals.

Major efforts of this project are devoted to: gaining real-time knowledge of the Battlespace Environment (BSE), determining the natural environment needs of regional warfare, providing the on-scene commander with the capability to exploit the environment to tactical advantage and, developing atmospheric research related to detection of sea-skimming missiles and strike warfare. This project provides natural environment applied research for all fleet operations and for current or emerging systems, and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations, maintenance, repair and upgrades that enable applied research at sea and provides modeling and analysis for environmental compliance for ONR/NRL field work and active acoustic experiments. Major developments are routinely transitioned to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center and to the Naval Oceanographic Office where they are used to provide timely information about the natural environment for all fleet operations.

Joint Littoral Warfare efforts address issues in undersea, surface, and air battlespace. Efforts include ocean and atmospheric analysis and prediction for real-time description of the operational environment, shallow water acoustics, multiple-influence sensors for undersea surveillance and weapon systems, and influences of the natural environment on MCM and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems. Joint Strike Warfare efforts address issues in air battlespace dominance. Efforts include influences of the natural environment on air operations, electromagnetic (EM)/electro-optic (EO) systems used in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, bomb damage assessment, and detection of missile weapon systems. They also include improvements in tactical information management about the BSE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Complete the effort to demonstrate an extremely compact hyperspectral imager (HSI) employed to retrieve coastal environmental products, ultimately from very small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), by modifying a prototype sensor, incorporating smartphone technology for control and processing and evaluate the performance for quantitative retrieval of environmental products.  Complete the effort to couple sediment models that use accurate numerical representations of coastal sediment dynamics with coastal optical modeling systems in order to accurately forecast the appearance and persistence of near-bottom turbidity layers and sediment re-suspension events.

Undersea Warfare 
Applied research focused on minimizing the logistics burden of persistently maintaining multiple sensors in remote or challenged locations.  The research emphasizes technologies leading to non-platform-based systems through novel power sources and power-harvesting.  For example, benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) are prototype power supplies that generate power from the oxidation of sedimentary organic matter and are intended for marine deployed sensor systems presently powered by batteries.  BMFCs can provide power for long-term, uninterrupted operation of Anti-Submarine Warfare; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; and scientific systems otherwise limited in operational lifetime by battery depletion.

                                <r2:Description>The Ocean Acoustics activity is dedicated to the determination of the impact of the natural ocean environment on acoustic wave phenomena in support of naval undersea warfare and underwater force protection operations. This activity studies underwater acoustic propagation, scattering from ocean boundaries, and ambient noise issues that impact the development and employment of acoustic systems. The littoral zone has been the ocean environment of greatest interest. Aspects of this environment, that greatly impact underwater acoustic systems, are the shallow water, the consequent closeness and physical significance of the ocean bottom, and the complexities inherent to rapid changes of the ocean structure. The objectives of this program are met through measuring, analyzing, modeling and simulating, and exploiting ocean acoustic factors to gain advantage over potential adversaries using undersea acoustic systems. Results of this activity support acoustic sensor and system development, performance prediction, and tactical decision aids.

This Activity will also focuses on efforts addressing research needs identified by Task Force Ocean that will enable tactical maneuver for the future submarine force. The efforts funded by this Program Element (PE) fall generally into two topic areas: Analysis and understanding of the impact of environmental conditions on Large Vertical Aperture (LVA) Array sonar data, and the development of reduced order ocean-acoustic models to enable environmental awareness and prediction on forward platforms.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Physical Oceanography activity is to develop knowledge of the physics of the ocean within the battlespace environment to enable tactical naval use and exploitation of the battlespace. This is achieved through the development of predictive models of the water mass structure, waves, currents, and air-sea interactions and developing measurement/observation technology. Other applications utilize knowledge of the interaction of the water column hydrodynamics and the acoustics to predict the undersea transmission characteristics and sources of uncertainty in these statistics. Utilizing knowledge of the ocean surface physics, the physical oceanography program seeks to exploit the combination of remotely sensed data, in-situ data, and adaptively sampled data to optimize predictions of ocean currents and water column structure. These predictions, custom databases, adaptive sampling schemes and data programs serve Anti-Submarine Warfare, Naval Special Warfare, and Mine and Expeditionary Warfare.

This Program requires field research that involves participation in Navy Environmental planning efforts including environmental planning documents (Environmental Impact Statements). The use of active acoustic transmissions requires
modeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&amp;S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These applied research initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.

This program funds the applied research, study, assessment, and demonstration of technologies that could provide a non-lethal capability or target effect. Investment areas include applied research related to: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal acoustic and optical technologies; advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications); associated human effects and effectiveness for new non-lethal stimuli; injury potential and effectiveness of directed energy, electric incapacitation, ocular, and acoustic based non-lethal technologies; and developing models of crowd behavior and dynamics.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Some examples of counter-personnel research include non-lethal weapon (NLW) effectiveness and behavioral research studies, feasibility and conceptual design studies for next-generation electro-muscular incapacitation and directed energy technologies (e.g., lasers, millimeter-waves) suitable for extended range applications and to achieve longer duration of effect.  Investigation and initial design of component high power microwave system technologies and advanced materials for counter-materiel applications will continue in order to enable reduced system sizes, increased energy efficiency, improved performance, and increased delivery and employment options. Continue applied research to characterize non-lethal phenomena and assess target human effects and weapon effectiveness, including development of dose response and injury correlates for new NLW technologies.   Initiate exploration of new non-lethal effects and evaluation of innovative applications of existing technologies to address future non-lethal capability needs.

Some examples of counter-personnel research include optimizing known NLW effectiveness and discovery of new human target behavioral effects which mitigate these Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel-approved joint non-lethal effects capability-gaps.  Other examples are the assessment and study of new NLW technologies related to: (1) increasing the range of current NLWs; (2) increasing their duration of effect; and (3) increasing the volume of fire associated with NLWs.  This includes developing longer range, more compact: (1) NL sound and light devices; (2) smaller, lighter, and more power efficient high power microwave systems; and (3) developing new non-lethal laser induced plasma weapons for long range counter-personnel and counter-materiel applications.  The objective is to further reduce non-lethal directed energy weapon system size, weight, power consumption, thermal cooling requirements and overall system cost while increasing counter-personnel and counter-materiel capabilities.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds applied research efforts in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking, and neutralization.  Technologies being developed within this PE are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking, and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  Related efforts are aimed at leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship, and air ASW assets. Research focused on understanding the impacts on marine mammals of manmade underwater sound is also conducted in the Program Element , as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea.

The activities described in this program element PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ASW Distributed Search focuses on the development of technologies for the non-covert tactical search for undersea targets ranging from hours to weeks, using automated sensor systems deployed around operating areas, including along key transit routes to protect naval/maritime forces, around temporarily fixed sea base regions and naval force operating areas, or around fixed defensive regions and areas of interest, such as key US/Allied ports. "Non-covert" implies availability of airborne assets for sensor deployment (although other means may also be used), and the ability to employ active sonar along with passive and non-acoustic methods. "Search" is conducted in concentrated areas, typically exploiting cues received from surveillance systems. The submarine target must be detected beyond its weapons release range. The objective is to develop rapidly deployable systems employing automated detection and classification capabilities for use in both shallow and deep water operating environments. Distributed Search supports the ASW protected passage Maritime Shield operational constructs. Related efforts include the development of distributed systems employing optimization as well as active acoustic sensing and processing techniques, navy-unique transduction and underwater networking technology. Efforts also include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable off-board deployable sensing systems employing persistent detection concepts and components. These efforts provide an extended reach of organic platform-based systems through the use of new sensor concepts, improved materials for advanced sensors, optimized deployment, employment, and automated operation of distributed sensor fields. The cornerstone of Distributed Search is the development of rapidly deployable, long-endurance active sensors with automated processing suitable for use in a wide variety of operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Precision Localization focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies which use information from surveillance or search systems to determine an area of uncertainty (AOU) relative to target range, bearing, and depth adequate to handoff to an attack system. Precision Localization employs non-acoustic techniques such as magnetic and optical sensing to highly localize submerged threats. The objective is to increase magnetic sensor range and robustness, enable deployment on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and increase optical sensing search rates. Efforts include the development of non-traditional tracking and advanced magnetic and electric field sensors and processing. These technologies will provide a decreased AOU size thus enabling the effective use of smaller, more versatile torpedoes as well as increased performance gain in detection, targeting, tracking/trailing, and homing via target acquisition and covert prosecution.</r2:Description>

The surveillance process includes initial detection and classification. Efforts include the development of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle-based and affordable, off-board deployable sensing systems employing a wide variety of surveillance concepts and components.

                                        <r2:Text>Extramural Marine Mammals and Biology - Areas of research include monitoring and detection, integrated ecosystem, and effects of sound on marine mammals. 

Integrated Ecosystem Research: Further research using animal tagging and passive acoustic monitoring to study behaviors, movement and distribution of marine mammals relative to key environmental properties (biotic and abiotic). 

Effects of Sound: Conduct research on behavioral effects to potentially population-level consequences of sound exposure on marine life. Initiate research to characterize the gas management and kinetics (stores and use) in marine mammals. Conduct research into the mechanisms that enable marine mammals to dive to deep depths for long durations while mitigating, if not avoiding, health threats. Conduct research to advance our understanding of sound reception mechanisms in mysticetes (large whales) will require a thorough exploration of the anatomy surrounding the ear and the whole head combined with modeling sound propagation through various tissues of whale heads and/or bodies. Continue research to develop an understanding of the natural variation of stress markers, better understand and characterize acute and chronic effects of the stress response on individuals and populations of marine mammals. Conduct research on potential effects of Navy sources on marine mammal behavior, life functions (e.g. feeding, breeding, migrating), vital rates (e.g. adult survival, reproduction), and population level effects. Understanding the effects of naval activities on species or stocks of marine mammals, including effects on annual rates of recruitment and survival. 

Monitoring and Detection: Continue research and development of technology for detection, classification, and localization of marine mammals. 

Models &amp; Databases: Continue research to provide tools to support environmental compliance efforts and decision-making related to how marine mammals are affected by anthropogenic sounds. Initiate research using increase in funds to characterize and quantify the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on marine mammal populations.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>Undersea Weaponry focuses on the development of enabling technologies to counter threat submarines and surface vessels by increasing Probability of Kill and platform survivability, as well as developing technologies for unmanned undersea vehicles. Research performed within Undersea Weaponry supports several Naval S&amp;T Focus Areas including Power Projection &amp; Integrated Defense, Assure Access to Maritime Battlespace, Autonomy &amp; Unmanned Systems, and Power &amp; Energy. Weapon technology focus areas include: Explosives and Warheads, Guidance and Control (G&amp;C), Simulation Based Design, Propulsion, Power Sources, Supercavitation, and Counter Weapons/Counter Measures. The ultimate goal of this activity is to provide revolutionary capabilities needed to fill Sea Shield and Sea Strike Warfighter Capability Gaps, to accommodate unique payload limitations through the development of modular and reduced sized undersea weapons based on common technology enablers (where possible), to provide improved platform pre-engagement positioning and fire-control solutions for effective weapon-to-target engagement, and provide countermeasures and counterweapons against current and next-generation undersea weapons.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The objective of the work in this PE is to develop and mature technologies needed by the Navy and Marine Corps to initiate FNCs in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development that can be commenced at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  The FNC Program was restructured for FY 2019 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in PE 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  Funding for technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in this PE.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is working closely across the Department of the Navy (DON) and Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Prior to FY 2019, the underlying Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program investments in this program element (PE) were aligned to specific FNC projects. Future budget activity (BA) 2 investments supporting candidate FNC technologies are being developed in order to increase agility, exploit technology advances, and respond quickly to naval needs. This approach facilitates an optimum response when developing and maturing the technology options that will be developed further in PE 0603673N, Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  

The FNC Program has been fully restructured for FY 2019 in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration, PE R-2 activities are now organized by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Departments, which are tasked to collaborate with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors.  A complete accounting of the technology candidates being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort funded in this PE will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides technologies for Naval Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare, U.S. Naval sea mining, Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Joint Tri-Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable applied research at sea. This program is strongly aligned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Warfighting Capability Objectives through the development of technologies to achieve military objectives with minimal casualties and collateral damage. Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three "key transformational capabilities" required by "Sea Shield" as well as technically enable the Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within "Sea Strike" by focusing on technologies that will provide the Naval Force with the capability to dominate the battlespace, project power from the sea, and support forces ashore with particular emphasis on rapid MCM operations. These efforts concentrate on the development and transition of technologies for the MCM-related and Urban Asymmetric/Expeditionary Warfare Operations (UAEO)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Enabling Capabilities (ECs). The Mine and Obstacle Detection/Neutralization efforts include technologies for clandestine and overt minefield reconnaissance, organic ship self-protection, organic minehunting and neutralization/breaching. The Urban Asymmetric Operation effort includes critical warfighting functions such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), fires, maneuver, sustainment, etc. The Naval Special Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal technology efforts concentrate on the development of technologies for safe near-shore mine detection, diver mobility and survivability, and ordnance disposal operations.

The activities described in this program element PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity focuses on applied research to enable longer detection ranges and precise mine location with fewer false alarms in a variety of challenging environments. It supports Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) and Mine Countermeasures (MCM)-related Future Naval Capabilities (FNCs). Efforts in Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technologies for longer range detection and classification of mine-like targets and magnetic gradiometer sensing and electro-optic (EO) technology for buried mine identification, and sensor integration onto Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are being addressed. EO sensor research develops algorithms to enable image processing for rapid overt reconnaissance from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Other processing, classification and data fusion techniques to reduce operator workload, and a mine burial prediction "expert system" are also being developed. Efforts also support development of MCM Mission Modules for Littoral Combat Ships.

The program is strongly aligned with the Oceanographer of the Navy (N2/N6E) and the research topics addressed by this sub activity reflects the priorities for improved forecasts of the operational environment and the development and use of autonomous systems for the collection of environmental observations and continuing support to research vessels of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet for operations and maintenance that enable science at sea. This Program requires field research that involves participation in Navy environmental planning efforts including environmental planning documents (Environmental Impact Statements). The use of active acoustic transmissions requires modeling of the acoustic effects of sound on marine life.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, the Applied Research Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development effort was realigned from Project Unit 0000 to Project Unit 2481 within this PE.

In FY 2020 a stand alone Artificial Intelligence (AI) R-2 Activity was established in Project Unit 0000 to consolidate and coordinate the acceleration of AI investments.

The FY 2017 Appropriation Act encouraged the services to realign Cyberspace Activity (CA) resources into individual cost codes, projects or program elements (PEs) in order to provide additional clarity and enhanced oversight of cyberspace resources.  Within this PE, cyber funding was moved from Proj 0000 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Applied Research to Proj 2958 Cyberspace Activities beginning in FY20, which was established to isolate and identify cyberspace activities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Applied Research associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program.  These investments represent game-changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.  The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future.  The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be established to support further development.  These investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Developing INPs requires a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems oriented toward the design and development of prototypes applicable to specific mission area requirements.  The efforts funded within this PE translate promising basic research into solutions for broadly defined military needs.  These efforts include developing breadboard hardware and algorithms that establish the initial feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions to technological challenges, such as concept exploration efforts, studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts.

Due to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  It is intended that prototypes developed within this program, requiring both Budget Activity 2 (BA2) and Budget Activity 3 (BA3) funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new technological capability.  The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs as existing ones are completed.  Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  INPs have been collectively grouped into R-2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy/Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber, Undersea Warfare and Artificial Intelligence.

Due to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Continue the TPCP project, previously funded predominantly in Program Element (PE) 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research.  Develop leap-ahead resilient cybersecurity tools that will enable our warfighting platforms to fight through current and future unauthorized cyber intrusions and assure command and control of any naval platform (submarine, surface, and air platforms) providing an adaptive cyber toolkit and real time cyber sensors.  This project develops cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time.  This project will develop software based capabilities and a compact and affordable computing appliance applicable to any aircraft, surface vessel, submarine or ground vehicle.  The technical development will leverage dynamic and active sensing and cyber vulnerability prevention science and technology approaches, including formal methods, model checking, and static/dynamic analyses which reduce cyber platform attack surfaces, prevent the exploitation of system vulnerabilities, shorten detection timelines, and perform other mitigation functions.  Commercial off-the-shelf software components will be leveraged to develop technology for de-bloating and delayering so as to reduce the attack surface and ensure platform resiliency against unauthorized cyber intrusions.</r2:Text>

Future adversaries will seek to neutralize U.S. conventional advantages by capitalizing on asymmetric capabilities that incorporate mobility, range, speed and deception.  Naval platforms will be on the front line of our national integrated defensive capabilities to defeat these emerging threats that are proliferating.  At the same time, the fleet/force must be able to effectively strike targets with survivable, scalable and cost-effective weapons that have sufficient range, speed and accuracy to complete a variety of missions while reducing risk to our warfighters and without creating unnecessary collateral damage or loss of life.  Technologies within this activity will provide scalable lethality through enabling multi-domain, integrated, scalable kinetic and non-kinetic systems for offensive of defensive purposes.</r2:Description>

Continue EMRG, previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research and PE 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research. The EMRG capability will support Naval Surface Fires, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), Fast Attack Craft and Fast Inshore Attack Craft (FAC/FIAC) defense and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions.  Conduct applied research addressing the unique technical challenges inherent in the construction, assembly and operation of an Electro Magnetic (EM) railgun prototype capable of launching long range projectiles repeatedly, many times per minute.  Special materials and compact sub-system components will be developed that are capable of operating in harsh thermal and electromagnetic environments.  Advanced modeling tools will be developed to assess design options, analyze system concepts and inform experimental hardware design and testing.  Develop and test next generation battery energy storage and pulsed power components to assess performance and applicability towards future designs.  Develop and refine algorithms for controlling the precision timed electromagnetic pulse used to fire the railgun in the rep-rate mode.  Conduct material, physics and thermal property research for long life, rep-rate electromagnetic launch systems and actively monitor performance to understand the high currents, elevated operating temperatures, and cooling of components, so as to improve designs and increase their reliability.  Develop modeling and simulation tools that support electromagnetic launch, multi-shot life development, testing, and assessments, and ASuW missions.  The capability will electromagnetically launch a projectile with sufficient kinetic energy to travel significantly farther than traditional Naval gunfire.   

High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike (HIJENKS):
Continue HIJENKS, a joint USAF/USN project previously funded as a FY17 jump-start effort in PE 0602114N Power Projection Applied Research.  Develop a High Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) technology payload integrated on an air platform capable of engaging multiple electronic targets with a single, scalable effects weapon across a variety of warfighting missions. This effort will culminate in a live-fire demonstration of a multi-mission/multi-target HPRF payload integrated into a demonstration platform.  The operational impacts include decreased cost exchange ratios, non-kinetic counter electronic effects, reduced collateral damage, and the ability to engage multiple targets with a single weapon.  This effort aligns Naval Science and Technology (S&amp;T) with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.  During FY18, the following applied research development efforts are planned:  investigate Radio Frequency (RF) effects on complex electronic systems with the goal being to finalize an RF waveform specification; investigate High-Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) weapons effects for non-kinetic counter electronics to include the prediction model improvements required for mission planning of Directed Energy Weapons (DEW); perform Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to capture Radio Frequency (RF) antenna output, RF propagation, RF interaction with complex enclosures, and RF interaction with electronic circuits to characterize Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) performance to the maximum extent possible; conduct research into the time-out of action or recuperation time for complex electronics, exploring Battle Damage Indicators (BDI) for electronic disruption; determine the critical pulsed power and RF components required to reduce the High Power Radio Frequency (HPRF) payload's Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); perform a trade-off analysis of the technology alternatives, their maturity, and their suitability for this application; develop the most promising component technologies, such as conformal antenna designs for high power, advanced high power RF source technologies, pulsed power components with higher energy densities, and advanced architectures and magnetic materials for high voltage power electronics systems; conduct risk reduction research for the RF source and antenna subsystems by examining high risk, high payoff technology alternatives to improve output power while simultaneously reducing system size and weight, and examine the efficiency of each subsystem and the impact of overall payload prime power requirements.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2020, the Applied Research Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development effort was realigned from Project Unit 0000 to Project Unit 2481 within PE 0602792N.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) is a high-power, kinetic energy weapon capable of launching precision guided projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants. When released into the railgun, an electric pulse launches the projectile at speeds up to Mach 6. EMRG will bring new capabilities, increased capacity and improved operational economy to fleet operations at sea. With its increased velocity and extended range, the EM Railgun provides multi-mission potential for hypersonic missile defense, anti-air &amp; surface warfare, and naval surface fire support.

EMRG is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&amp;E programs. INP investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6.  It is intended that prototypes developed within this program, requiring both Budget Activity 2 (BA2) and Budget Activity 3 (BA3) funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new technological capability.  Successful experiments and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities, requiring significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  The Activity identified in Project Unit 2481 specifically addresses Applied Research in support of the Electro-Magnetic Railgun (EMRG) high-power, kinetic energy weapon prototype development INP effort. 

Due to the nature of these projects, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Within this PE, cyber funding was moved from Proj 0000 Innovative Naval Protoypes (INP) Applied Research to Proj 2958 Cyberspace Activities, which was established to isolate and identify cyberspace activities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project contains all Applied Research Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) investments that are developing new technologies for cyber warfare.  Potential adversaries are investing in advanced technologies that will challenge our advantages in the critical information domain.  Nation states and non-state actors seek to degrade our command and control capabilities, networks and computer systems.  Cyber threats continue to grow and rapidly proliferate.  Technologies developed in this R-2 Activity will enable the warfighter to take immediate, appropriate action at any time, against any desired adversary, target or network by assuring that autonomous, continuous analyses of intelligence, persistent surveillance and open information sources have, at all times, optimized the possible courses of action based on commander's guidance.  Technologies within this activity will foster operational endurance and enable sustained operations and resiliency for warfighters and platforms through enhanced cyber security/protection.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board. This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century. The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare. 

This PE addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This program supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial and air) and the protection of those platforms. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the capability of Platform and Force Protection for the U.S. Navy. This project supports the development of technologies associated with all naval platforms (surface, subsurface, terrestrial, and air) and the protection of those platforms. For the new FY 2016 effort, Forward Deployed Energy and Communications Outpost (FDECO) Innovative Naval Prototype (INP), the project addresses advanced technology development associated with providing the undersea energy and communications infrastructure necessary to assure undersea dominance; extend the reach of undersea assets; enhance situational awareness (SA) and standoff advantage without reducing forward presence and; provide endurance for unmanned systems necessary for force multiplication in an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environment.  For the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV), the project will radically change the way the Navy does mine influence sweep, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and electronic warfare (EW) missions; it will introduce larger unmanned surface vehicles (USV) to the Navy; and it will introduce advanced autonomy to the surface Navy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The activities described in this PE address future Navy and Marine Corps capabilities needed to maintain maritime superiority and ensure national security.  They are based on input from Naval Research Enterprise stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, OPNAV and Headquarters Marine Corps) and are designed to exploit breakthroughs in science and technology in order to deliver maximum warfighting benefit to our sailors and marines.  These efforts are aligned with shared priorities throughout the whole of RDT&amp;E in order to quickly advance new capabilities from discovery to deployment across the warfighting domains.

Activities and efforts in this PE address technologies critical to enabling the transformation of discrete functions to network centric warfare capabilities, which simultaneously perform Radar, Electronic Warfare (EW), and Communications and Network functions across platforms through multiple, simultaneous and continuous communications/data links.  The Electromagnetic Systems Advanced Technology program addresses Radio Frequency (RF) technology for Surface and Aerospace Surveillance sensors and systems, EW sensors and systems, RF Communication Systems, Multi-Function sensor systems, and Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities.  Within the Naval Transformational Roadmap, this investment offers affordable options for the transformational capabilities required by the Sea Shield (Theater Air and Missile Defense), Sea Strike (Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), and ForceNet (Communications and Networking) SeaPower 21 Naval Warfighting Pillars. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Research efforts are carefully selected to ensure they have the potential to expand warfighting capabilities, inform operational concepts and requirements development, and advance state of the art technology and scientific knowledge.  Current guidance also highlights the need to accelerate our pace of development and guide the approach to rapid experimentation, prototyping, and learning.

As reflected in the Marine Corps Operating Concept, the current strategic guidance from the Commandant, expeditionary forces will conduct maneuver warfare in environments characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information used as a weapon, a battle of signatures, and an increasingly contested maritime domain. Additionally, an emergent operation stressor is the contested urban environment which exemplifies the characterizations listed above. The urban environment is one of the most complex terrains with physical compartmentalization and canalization, additional physical dimensions (subterranean and multi-story structures), crowded conditions and associated threat obscuration, communications challenges, informational and human aspects, and proliferation of observation and fires technologies. This environment requires capabilities addressing all the activities within this PE and while it provides many challenges, unique opportunities are also presented and can further shape technology approaches. 

These future challenges and portents demand robust technologies for the Marine Corps, but the technology options are constrained. They must have a lightweight deployable character, and the ability to operate in austere conditions with little fixed infrastructure or support while retaining the agility and lethality of an integrated maneuver force. Technology must provide full spectrum capability against robust and complex peer and near-peer adversaries while meeting Size, Weight, Power, Cost limitations, and information availability within Distributed, Intermittent and Limited environments. 

The approach within this PE encompasses ideas that support both revolutionary and evolutionary capabilities, and in this way considers and balances both "push" and "pull" aspects of technology projects.  This PE matures technologies emerging from PE 0602131M-Marine Corps Landing Force Technology to develop concept prototypes and initial experimentation to confirm feasibility in an environment relavent to operations. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds technology demonstration, experimentation, and prototyping; and more technologically mature projects within the Future Naval Capability (FNC) process as means to inform, enhance, enable, and invent future concepts and capabilities with new S&amp;T. This project is organized into ten activities, the core of which is represented by the eight Expeditionary Warfighting Capability Areas.

Emphasized within this project are increased efforts to actively demonstrate advanced technologies and system concepts. These demonstrations and experiments focus on the specific technologies, not necessarily their operational application, and vary based on the technical maturity of the project. This early technology exposure gives Marines a view into the future and enables them to use their imagination and innovation to envision novel employment of the technology and inform the acquisition process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This activity investigates robust, resilient, and secure networked communications pathways and capability that support an expeditionary force's distributed and disaggregated operations. Research supports both networked and local computation for communications that exploits the expeditionary forces close physical proximity to threats while mitigating shortfalls commiserate within Distributed, Intermittent, and Limited environments. Expeditionary forces must operate in the cyber domain and in addition to defending communications networks, vehicles, and weapons systems, are reliant on electronic controllers for basic operations and as such are susceptible to cyberattacks.

Technologies addressed within this activity include secure, robust, self-forming, mobile communications networks; distributed computing to support information dissemination to all echelons; improved capabilities in over-the-horizon, beyond line-of-sight, and restricted environment communications and sensors; and software and data processing to support formation of an appropriate common picture. Other efforts include power management, low detectability, conforming to Size, Weight, Power, Cost constraints, and interoperability within the joint environment.

Further, this activity integrates and demonstrates enhanced communications and situational awareness capabilities in experimental and warfighting environments reflecting USMC operations. Advanced technology resources will be developed and applied to complement commercial, other service, and defense agency investments to produce a technology base addressing identified Marine Corps technology gaps.  Focus will be on developing component level prototypes and experimentation in relevant environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The activity investigates a large variety of weapons to provide the warfighter with a decisive, yet surgical, tactical advantage to collectively address 21st-century combined-arms warfare against peer and near-peer states. Research efforts increase the reach, lethality and capacity, while retaining mobility and tempo beneficial to expeditionary maneuver warfare. Maintaining focus on Size, Weight, Power, Cost and Distributed, Intermittent and Limited  environments stresses the technical solutions available.

This activity furthers the maturity of researched technology solutions by also developing the integration required to effectively demonstrate and test emergent capabilities. Achieving a true combined arms state involves a full systems approach for both kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities all driven by a holistic targeting capability.

This activity develops technology for application on current and future expeditionary weapons and elements of the kill chain. It includes, but is not limited to, the following technologies: fuze, fire control, targeting, launch/propulsion, lethality, and accuracy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>USMC FUTURE NAVAL CAPABILITIES</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity addresses the advanced technology development associated with the Marine Corps' participation in the Department of the Navy's (DoN) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program.  The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC technology candidates funded in PE 0602131M that have been matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). Investments in this activity are coordinated with similar and non-duplicative efforts in PE 0603673N.  The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, is being resourced in this PE.  Funding for FNC technology candidates at lower TRLs (3 to 4) is being resourced in PE 0602131M.  ONR is working closely with the Resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces. 

Prior to FY19, FNC Program investments were selected almost two years in advance of execution.  It was determined by Navy and Marine Corps leadership that this approach limits DON's ability to exploit technology advances and respond quickly to naval needs.  As a result, future BA 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution. Because FNCs are now starting at higher TRLs, the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Individual R-2 Activities have been discontinued and investments are organized to enhance collaboration with the acquisition stakeholders and their resource sponsors. A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2019 Plans include development and evaluation of mobility technologies and future concepts for the ground and amphibious fleet to improve maneuverability across a range of challenging terrain environments.  Work will emphasize experimentation with autonomy approaches through both simulation and live events for amphibious vehicles from small low cost craft, traditional amphibious combat and assault vehicles, and landing craft. Additional focus will be on integrating real time precepts with learned information, a priori knowledge, and contextual understanding to facilitate informed autonomous decision making.  There will be demonstration and experimentation with systems that enable intelligent planning, reasoning, learning, and control to affect tactically appropriate autonomous behaviors in littoral and urban environments.  In addition efforts will be pursued in component technology and prototypes for future advanced manned expeditionary ground vehicles and amphibians.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a subordinate organization under the Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration (DC, CD&amp;I), the mission of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory / Futures Directorate (MCWL/FD) is to identify future challenges and opportunities, develop warfighting concepts, and comprehensively explore options in order to inform the combat development process to meet the challenges of the future operating environment.  DC, CD&amp;I is designated as the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Advocate for Science and Technology (S&amp;T).  MCWL's Commanding General (CG) is the DC, CD&amp;I designated Proponent of USMC S&amp;T and serves as the USMC Executive Agent for Marine Corps S&amp;T.  The MCWL/FD also serves as the Marine Corps' liaison to the Joint Staff for Joint Concept Development and Experimentation; thereby facilitating service-specific experiments as well as participation in joint service experimentation.  

The current MCWL/FD Campaign Plan addresses how the Naval Services must reshape their capabilities in order to meet the concepts and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) called for in the Secretary of the Navy's "Cooperative Strategy 21" and the Marine Corps' capstone Marine Operating Concept (MOC), according to the objectives of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' guidance to develop the future Marine Corps Force 2025.  Execution of the MCWL/FD Campaign Plan results in recommendations to Marine Corps advocates and proponents so that they may more cohesively and logically structure the future Navy and Marine Corps team.  In support of the Marine Corps' role to provide an ever-ready quick strike force to protect US interests, MCWL/FD pursues concepts and new capabilities focused on the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The MAGTF is the Marine Corps' doctrinal, task organized, force deployment package.  It consists of four elements: the Command Element that provides overarching Command and Control  of the entire force; the Ground Combat Element normally built around a core infantry unit with supporting armor, artillery, and other ground units; the Aviation Combat Element which provides aircraft, air defense, and other aviation functions; and the Logistics Combat Element which consists of Combat Service Support  elements including medical, supply, and transportation.  Marine Corps Force 2025 also seeks to maximize the employment of electronic, information, and cyber warfare, as well as manned/unmanned teaming, within each element of the MAGTF.  MCWL/FD also examines future enhancements in training, organization, and equipment.  MCWL/FD accomplishes its mission through five subordinate Divisions:  

Futures Assessment Division's mission is to:  research, examine, and describe plausible future security environments 15 to 30 years into the future.  Knowledge of these future security environments will provide an estimate of possible future threats, challenges, and opportunities, to include:  the rise of possible partners and adversaries, emerging disruptive technologies, and likely sources of conflict.  This work is largely accomplished through research, seminar participation, and coordination with various experts in academia, the intelligence community, and think tanks. 

The mission of Concepts and Plans Division is to:  examine select future security environments, emerging warfighting opportunities and challenges, and Naval warfare and joint/coalition integration and capabilities, in order to develop Marine Corps Service concepts and CONOPS to promote development of the emergent Marine Corps force.  CAP is responsible for the production of formally published concepts, CONOPS, and options for future force organization and posture that describe how the Marine Corps will operate and fight.

Wargaming Division conducts formal wargames to frame emerging warfighting concepts, establish the Joint context for the Marine Corps Force Development System, and identify opportunities for development of experimental and non-experimental capabilities. 

Experiment Division conducts live force concept-based experimentation to facilitate exploration of prototype and surrogate technologies, as well as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), in order to better refine equipment requirements and to identify Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) initiatives needed to produce future capabilities.  

Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Division conducts investigations and assessments to identify, modify where appropriate, and evaluate technological capabilities that support advanced warfighting concepts, and to explore the military utility of promising new commercial or government technologies in support of urgent and compelling needs.  MCWL/FD investigates the relevance to MOC-prescribed capabilities and gaps of advanced technologies according to the following Thrust Areas:  Command, Control, Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Autonomy and Robotics; MAGTF Fires; Maneuver; Expeditionary Logistics (to include Expeditionary Energy); Expeditionary Medicine; Cyber and Electronic Warfare (EW); and Force Protection. 

This project is organized into 6 activities, the core of which are represented by the Warfighting Capability Areas of the MAGTF.  The project emphasizes development and demonstration of advanced technology capability concepts, and the examination of their operational application and military utility in the context of live-force field experimentation with Marines.  This operational experimentation directly supports Marine Corps combat development to inform future capability requirements and optimize the acquisition process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>Research conducted under this Project includes advanced technology programs sponsored and managed from both the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory/Futures Directorate (MCWL/FD).

ONR is funding the development and demonstration of a variant of the 81mm Advanced Capability Extended Range Mortar (ACERM) with improved size, weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) through the insertion of an optimized actuator.  The ACERM technology enhances the mission effectiveness of USMC infantry forces through a significant increase in maximum range, while providing a first round on target capability against both stationary and moving targets while minimizing the relative increase in unit cost.  In addition, the development of a Cannon Delivered Area Effects Munition (CDAEM) payload will be developed for the 155mm Moving Target Artillery Round (MTAR).  The capability will greatly enhance the USMC's ability to effectively engage area targets to destroy, neutralize, and/or suppress threat platforms and facilities, and deny threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area when there is a lack of precise target location, as is often the case with moving forces, counter fire missions, or when threat forces employ battlefield obscurants.

MCWL/FD is sponsoring experiments to determine the military utility of small tactical autonomous unmanned ground vehicle systems to support logistics, fires and maneuver.  Funds support the development and demonstration of tactical ground robotic vehicle systems as well as autonomy and perception algorithms utilizing a common ground control system.  The capability will greatly enhance the tactical effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of tactical infantry formations in close combat operating environments.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD Non-Lethal Weapons Program was established by the FY96 National Defense Authorization Act. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Commandant of the
Marine Corps (CMC) as the DoD NLW Executive Agent (EA). The EA exercises centralized responsibility for joint research and development of non-lethal weapons and technology through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP). The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&amp;S) serves as the OSD Principal Staff Assistant and oversees, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DoD NLW Executive Agent.

The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) reflect science and technology (S&amp;T) investment decisions by the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons (NLW) Integrated Product
Team, a multi-service flag level corporate board that provides executive oversight and management for the JNLWP for the CMC. This direction is based on the requirements and capabilities sought by the Services and the Coast Guard, as identified in the DoD's Non-Lethal Weapons Joint Capabilities Based Assessment Document. This coordinated joint S&amp;T development approach addresses mutual capability gaps and assures the most relevant non-lethal technologies, capabilities and equipment are provided to the operating forces while eliminating duplicative service S&amp;T investment. These advanced technology development initiatives feed non-lethal capabilities which directly support the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objective of strategic competition by providing options to the joint force in pursuit of national objectives in legal or policy constrained scenarios, as well as complementing the use of lethal effects in complex combat scenarios, for example, in urban environments with large civilian populations. Ongoing NLW studies, analyses and exercise efforts with NATO and Allies also support NDS objectives to strengthen alliances and partnerships. Resulting capabilities will facilitate a fully integrated non-lethal competency as a complement to lethal firepower, providing force application options for below lethal threshold engagements.

This program funds Advanced Technology Development of next-generation non-lethal capabilities and includes performing analysis, technology development efforts, and modeling and simulation necessary to ensure optimum weaponization and use of these capabilities. Investment areas include research and development of next-generation NLWs such as: non-lethal directed energy weapons (lasers, millimeter wave and high power microwave) for counter-personnel and counter-materiel missions; non-lethal counter-personnel technologies (acoustic, optical, and human electro-muscular disruption technologies), and advanced non-lethal materials (including materials for vehicle/vessel stopping and counter-facility applications). Next generation non-lethal systems focus on long-range localized non-lethal effects to identified threat individuals (or groups of individuals) and/or their threat weapons systems operating in complicated environments such as urban areas, crowds, buildings, vehicles, vessels, and also in close proximity to high-value civilian facilities.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) program represents the requirements-driven, delivery-oriented piece of the Department of the Navy (DON) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio. The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the FNC Program.  The objective of the work in this PE is to develop promising technologies emerging from the FNC Applied Research program that have successfully matured to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).  

The FNC Program was restructured for FY19 to accelerate transition to the Fleet and Force.  This restructuring involved a zero based review of all ongoing FNC projects, where each effort was assessed for its technology maturity and transition commitment.  Ongoing efforts were categorized as FNCs or Technology Candidates.  Some efforts were terminated and others were accelerated to achieve the goals of the restructured program.  Funding for FNCs, which have higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs of 4/5 to 6) and transition funding commitments, are being resourced in this PE, 0603673N Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development.  ONR is coordinating closely with the resource Sponsors and acquisition stakeholders to develop high priority technological capabilities needed by the operational forces.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Prior to FY19, Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Program investments were selected almost two years in advance of execution.  It was determined by Navy and Marine Corps leadership that this approach limits Department of the Navy's (DON) ability to exploit technology advances and respond quickly to naval needs.  As a result, future Budget Activity (BA) 3 investments supporting the FNC Program are now made less than one year before commencing execution.  Because FNCs are now starting at higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), the typical duration of an FNC has been shortened to 3-years.  The FNC Program has been fully restructured in favor of a more direct and higher level of collaboration.  Program Element R-2 Activities were modified for FY19 to align to warfare areas and the corresponding resource sponsors that will integrate FNC technologies into acquisition programs of record.  These R-2 Activities have been continued into FY20.  

A complete accounting of the technologies being developed and a full disposition of each technology development effort will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Training simulator software and hardware to support the rapid integration and interoperability of air and ground legacy and future simulation-based training is being developed to address the shortfall in sorties needed to maintain readiness for integrated air and ground operations of the marine air-ground task force.  This technology will allow pilots and aircrews to train effectively in a common, simulated operating environment. Flexible and interoperable learning continuum and performance aids will be developed, providing individual career management, skill classification, selection, automatic training content re-engineering, supervisor evaluations, and Fleet readiness tracking.  New machine learning algorithms will input training data from the lifelong learning record, and output a training model that is usable for adaptive training. The focus on ready relevant training will accelerate learning, reduce the decay of acquired skills, and provide readiness tracking of performance at an individual level.</r2:Text>

Mission management tools will be developed for the Mine Countermeasures Commander to assist in the planning and re-planning, scheduling, and allocation of MCM task force assets using an extremely modular, open systems approach. This will provide MCM Commanders with the ability to rapidly re-plan and schedule emerging LCS/MCM Mission Package assets and maintain situational awareness of heterogeneous groups of systems. The investment in single-system, day/night, multi-mission airborne mine detection technologies usable at all water depths will be increased in order to reduce the MCM timeline and facilitate our capability to counter surface/near surface mines in the Surf Zone or Beach Zone (BZ) at night. The viability of the preliminary design and schedule to support Fire Scout integration will be thoroughly explored. New mine neutralization technologies will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Navy expeditionary force capabilities in their assigned response mission to counter naval mine and maritime improvised explosive device threats. This technology will enhance the capability of the Maritime Expeditionary Standoff Response (MESR) System of Systems.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board.  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment and technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies. 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the development and demonstration of field medical equipment, diagnostic capabilities and treatments; technologies to improve warfighter safety and to enhance personnel performance under adverse conditions; and systems to prevent occupational injury and disease in hazardous, deployment environments.  Navy investment in these areas is essential because Navy/USMC mission needs are not adequately addressed by the civilian sector or other Federal agencies.  For example, civilian emergency medicine does not address casualty stabilization during long transit times to definitive care.  The National Institutes for Health (NIH) focuses on the basic science of disease processes and not product development.  Programs are coordinated with other Services through the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Committee to prevent duplication of effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>All Navy advanced technology development in undersea target detection, classification, localization, tracking and neutralization is funded through this Program Element (PE).  The related technologies being developed are aimed at enabling Sea Shield, one of the three core operational concepts detailed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Associated efforts focus on new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operational concepts that promise to improve wide-area surveillance, detection, localization, tracking and attack capabilities against quiet adversary submarines operating in noisy and cluttered shallow water environments.  The focus is on leveraging technologies that will protect the country's current capital investment in surveillance, submarine, surface ship and air ASW assets.

The efforts described in this Program Element PE are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board (20 Jan 2015).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance and input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps).  It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval forces in the 21st century.  The Strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the development of recent technology breakthroughs to meet current operational needs from a subscale proof-of-principle into a full-scale prototype for warfighter experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations, Fleet Battle Experiments (FBE), Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs) and sea trial exercises. The key aspects of this PE are divided into four areas: (1) SwampWorks develops and demonstrates newly invented or recently discovered technologies that address emergent and enduring operational problems in an accelerated timeframe; (2) ONR Experimentation (OE) develops rapid prototypes and provides them to the warfighter for experimentation during laboratory and operational demonstrations; (3) TechSolutions develops rapid response science and technology prototypes addressing Fleet/Force needs identified by Sailors and Marines at the deckplate level; (4) Operations Analysis provides the Navy and Marine Corps the means to identify capability needs that can be addressed with science and technology solutions; and (5) support for the Naval Precision Strike Operations, providing the Navy capability to quickly locate, target, and strike critical targets.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

components including subsystems into prototypes quickly. These technologies are provided to the warfighter for
experimentation, field experiments, and/or tests in simulated or actual environments. The use of Navy Warfare
Development Command (NWDC) Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) events is encouraged and the net results are to gain the
knowledge that only an experiment can provide.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Overall metric goals are to transition the 6.3 advanced technology projects into acquisition programs of record, demonstrate successful technologies to enable new operational concepts, and enable the production of technology products such as proofs of concept and manufacturing packages. The performance of the work funded in this PE is reviewed at several levels to ensure that the investment is relevant and productive.  At the macroscopic level, the investment is coordinated with Navy Warfare Development Command and Commander, Fleet Forces Command to address the goals and objectives identified for sea trials and Limited Objective Experiments (LOEs).  At the microscopic level, the work funded in this PE is reviewed periodically by the Program Manager to ensure the investment is meeting the goals defined for each project. This review includes feedback collected from the warfighter community on all sea trials and LOEs to support the Program Manager's assessment of the value and relevance of each investment. Furthermore, the entire program is reviewed yearly by the Chief of Naval Research.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) are based on investment directions as defined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan approved by the S&amp;T Corporate Board and investment directions as defined by Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5160.62 "Single Manager Responsibility for Military Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology and Training (EODT&amp;T)" and approved by the DoD Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program Board (Sep 2012).  This strategy is based on needs and capabilities from Navy and Marine Corps guidance, input from the Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) stakeholders (including the Naval enterprises, the combatant commands, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and Headquarters Marine Corps). The strategy is also based on the unique needs and capabilities identified by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and the DoD EOD Program Board. It provides the vision and key objectives for the essential science and technology efforts that will enable the continued supremacy of U.S. Naval and Joint EOD forces in the 21st century.  The strategy focuses and aligns Naval S&amp;T with Naval missions, DoD EOD S&amp;T with Joint EOD missions and future capability needs that address the complex challenges presented by both rising peer competitors and irregular/asymmetric warfare.

This PE primarily develops and demonstrates prototype Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Expeditionary Warfare and Joint EOD system components that support capabilities enabling Naval and Joint EOD Forces to influence operations ashore.  Adversarial nations have the capability to procure, stockpile and rapidly deploy all types of naval mines, including new generation mines having sophisticated performance characteristics, throughout the littorals. They also have the capability to develop or modify explosive devices such as mines and unexploded ordnance to construct Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for the purpose of targeting Joint Forces.  Real world operations have demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the mine threat.  Current operations have also demonstrated the requirement to quickly counter the threat from explosive hazards and IEDs during DoD operations.  Advanced technologies must rapidly detect and neutralize all mine types, from deep water to the inland objective.  Advanced technologies must enable Joint EOD forces to detect/locate, gain access, diagnose, render safe, neutralize, recover, exploit and dispose of a broad spectrum of explosive hazards including unexploded ordnance and IEDs.  This program supports the advanced development and integration of sensors, processing, warheads, and delivery vehicles to demonstrate improved Naval Warfare capabilities. It supports the advanced development and integration of sensors and tools for standoff capabilities such as detection and location of IEDs (particularly in dismounted operations), dismounted diagnosis of buried munitions and other explosive hazards, precision render safe and neutralization of surface munitions and other explosive hazards, and enhanced access to IEDs.  It supports the MCM-related FNC Enabling Capabilities (ECs).  Within the Naval Transformation Roadmap, this investment will achieve one of three key transformational capabilities required by Sea Shield as well as technically enable the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) key transformational capability within Sea Strike.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, three new stand alone project units were created for three INP major focus areas to better consolidate and coordinate the acceleration of these efforts. The three project units are: 2480 Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM), 2481 the Electro-Magnetic Railgun, and 2958 Cyberspace Activities.

In FY 2020 a stand alone Artificial Intelligence (AI) R-2 Activity was established in Project Unit 3400 to consolidate and coordinate the acceleration of AI investments.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The efforts described in this Program Element (PE) address the Advanced Technology Development associated with the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Program.  These investments represent game changing technologies with the potential to revolutionize operational concepts.  They are disruptive in nature as they would dramatically change the way naval forces fight.  INPs push the imagination of our nation's technical talent to deliver transformational warfighting capabilities.

The projects in this portfolio are high risk, technically challenging development efforts that offer the potential of high warfighting payoff in the future. The goal of these investments is to develop and demonstrate the viability of new technological capabilities via experimental prototypes that prove the new capability could be implemented if an acquisition program were to be modified or established to support further development.  These technology investments are selected by a process that involves senior leadership in the Department of the Navy.

Developing INPs requires the development of subsystems and components, and efforts to integrate these subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and tests in an appropriate environment. The efforts funded within this Program Element (PE) include concept and technology demonstrations of components and subsystems, which may be form, fit and function prototypes or scaled models that serve the same demonstration purpose.  The goal of these development efforts is to prove the technological feasibility and assessment of subsystem and component operability and producibility rather than the development of hardware for service use.  By demonstrating the general military utility and direct relevance to identified military needs, the technology becomes available for transition and further development within an emerging or new Program of Record.  INP investments do not necessarily lead to subsequent development or procurement phases, but they do have the goal of moving out of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.  Because to the nature of these projects described, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) plans and associated resources are realigned from Project 3400 in PE 0603801N into this new Project 2480 within PE 0603801N effective FY 2020.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) is a multi-year effort in various stages of research and development within with the Navy's Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) family of RDT&amp;E programs. SSL-TM will develop a maritime laser weapons system prototype and test it on a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant, and conduct the required laser weapon system engineering, design, integration and testing necessary to have a testable, experimental prototype. This system will be capable of supporting missions such as defense against small boat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) disruption and defeat. At-sea testing will be conducted on the full laser weapon system demonstrator (i.e., prototype) from a representative test platform for a naval surface combatant.

Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) and LA-Tech investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing Innovative Naval Prototype technologies from a Technology Readiness Level 
(TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. It is intended that prototypes developed within the INP portfolio,  requiring both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new 
technological capability. Successful experimentations and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  Project 2480 SSL-TM contains the resources and associated program justification for the Directed Energy/Electric Weapons capability oriented Solid State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL TM) INP program.

Because to the nature of these efforts and research activities, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project and activity will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The primary technological metrics used in this PE involve experiments and tests that demonstrate proof of concept for the technological capability being developed.  Technology development is informed by periodic interaction with Naval warfighters, resource sponsors and the acquisition community.  At the lowest level, each project is evaluated against technical and financial milestones on a frequent basis.  Annually, each project is reviewed in depth for technical performance and development status by the Chief of Naval Research (CNR).  DON leadership is briefed on the portfolio's status by the CNR.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) and LA-Tech investments are typically 4-8 years in duration.  They provide a continuance of basic research by maturing technologies from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 or 3 to a TRL of 6. It is intended that prototypes developed within this program, requiring both Budget Activity (BA) 2 and BA3 funding, are demonstrated in a relevant environment to prove the feasibility of the new technological capability.  The portfolio is periodically refreshed through the selection of new INPs and LA-Tech investments as existing ones are completed. Successful experimentations and demonstrations are intended to present the Department of the Navy with a programmatic challenge as these new capabilities can lead to the obsolescence of existing capabilities and significant decisions as to the path forward for integrating the new technological capabilities into the warfighting systems of the future.  INPs and LA-Tech investments have been collectively grouped into R2 Activities that include Unmanned and Autonomous Systems, Directed Energy/Electric Weapons, Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare, Cyber and Undersea Warfare.

Because to the nature of these efforts and research activities, technology development plans have been written with limited details due to information security concerns.  Specific information on each project will be provided separately to the Congressional oversight committees.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Initiate the Advanced Technology Development effort for the TPCP project, previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0602123N Force Protection Applied Research, which will develop leap-ahead resilient cybersecurity tools to enable our warfighting platforms to fight through current and future unauthorized cyber intrusions and ensure command and control of any Naval platform (submarine, surface, and air platforms) by providing an adaptive cyber toolkit and real time cyber sensors. This project develops a prototype and will demonstrate cyber sensors and automated vulnerability assessment cyber tools that deliver comprehensive defense-in-depth cyber capabilities to monitor, detect, mitigate, and recover from cyber threats in near real-time. Relevant naval cyber tools will be developed and tested to verify the technology can autonomously perform cyber vulnerability assessments and implement mitigation strategies that protect naval platforms from unauthorized cyber intrusions. New cyber autonomy tools will be developed to protect critical naval warfighting capabilities supporting multiple missions, including time critical strike, expeditionary warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-air warfare. These tools, which rely on cyber components, will be developed and demonstrated over an extended period of time at several integrated hardware in-the-loop facilities across the Naval Research Enterprise. Optimized cyber resiliency warfighting effectiveness will be developed and demonstrated. The technology will be developed to protect common layers of cyber functionality in hardware components, and local, system, and peripheral buses. The protection will be extended into the system BIOS, hypervisor, operating system, middleware, the application space, and the network infrastructure.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>This R-2 Activity contains all Advanced Technology Development Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) investments that are developing new technologies for Unmanned and Autonomous Systems. Increased proliferation of inexpensive lethal threats targeting individual warfighters and high-value assets, combined with continued rapid advances in computing, power and energy, robotics, sensors and position guidance technologies, drives the requirement to augment expensive manned systems with less expensive, unmanned, fully autonomous systems that can operate in all domains. Technologies within this activity will provide integrated and distributed, autonomous and disaggregated systems to increase flexibility, reach, and heterogeneous swarms.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS)
Complete the AACUS project, which was previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development. Continue development of the design and build of a prototype sensor suite and software package suitable for integration and testing on an existing USMC rotary wing aircraft that will enable the capability for optional unmanned autonomous flight. Conduct development and planning for a demonstration of the system's ability to autonomously perform an assault support mission in an operationally representative environment. This demonstration will include performing autonomous take-off, conducting en route navigation, approaching and landing at multiple unprepared landing zones using supervisory control managed by a minimally trained Marine via a tablet-based application, detecting and avoiding ground based obstacles, and safely operating in degraded visual environments.

Claws 
Initiate Claws which will develop the autonomy required to operate large and extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in an anti-access, anti-denial environment. To support large and extra-large UUV operations further forward and farther from the battle group, the technology will be evolved to allow operations with limited navigational fixes and limited communication opportunities. During FY18, at-sea testing of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 research technologies will be initiated in a realistic environment. At-sea data will be collected to support the further development of Claws technologies emerging out of the Claws applied research effort in PE 0602792N. Analysis of promising technologies will be conducted using laboratory and at-sea testing to provide realistic performance data.

Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (LDUUV)
Complete LDUUV, which was previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603747N Undersea Warfare Advanced Technology Development. Continue progress developing a prototype LDUUV and demonstrate the autonomy technology that enables the LDUUV to avoid undersea static obstacles, operate in a variety of currents, and adapt to local environments so as to maintain station. Conduct development, testing and demonstration of the endurance technology and recommend a reliability strategy allowing for 30 days of continuous operations. Conduct a demonstration of the LDUUV fuel cell system installed in an LDUUV vehicle operating in an Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) like mission for 60 days. Continue to document the data analysis from the technology development in order to transition the information to Program Executive Office for the Littoral Combat Ship.

Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST)
Initiate the Advanced Technology Development effort for the LOCUST project, which will ultimately deliver a scalable system of inexpensive Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and payloads that will provide game-changing disruptive capabilities over a wide range of military operations and areas of operations. LOCUST will make advances in unmanned system collective autonomous behaviors, robust low probability of interception or detection ad hoc networks, and payload miniaturization and modularity breakthroughs to counter threats in constrained urban environments, as well as large-scale anti-access area denial defenses. This will be accomplished at greatly reduced cost and risk when compared to traditional manned platform target prosecution. During FY18, the LOCUST program will begin to develop a range of key technologies that will be integrated together in order to demonstrate a scalable system of inexpensive, commoditized, swarming UAVs that provide disruptive capabilities. Critical milestones for each major sub-system and system will be established, as well as a revisit to requirements and metrics throughout. Yearly war games will be utilized to shape and inform the demonstrations, which will be of increasing complexity in both mission and operating environment. The demonstrations in turn will provide the Navy with an ability to spiral out capability as needed. FY18 demonstrations are planned to encompass missions utilizing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and kinetic strike payloads.

Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV)
Continue the MDUSV project, which was previously funded predominantly in 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology
Development. The MDUSV project will design and build a prototype MDUSV platform sized for theater or global
independent operations. New autonomy, Mine Countermeasures (MCM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies will be integrated into the MDUSV platform. The capability of the MDUSV to autonomously perform ASW, MCM and EW missions over an extended period of time will be demonstrated during a 40-day period of at-sea testing. The capability to autonomously operate in all-weather conditions, using new technologies that provide robust perception using Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors that detect low radar cross-section craft with reduced vulnerability to jamming and reduced Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, will be assessed. The use of integrated acoustic and High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) mine influence sweep technologies as well as a novel ASW sensor suite that includes an advanced version of the Non-Traditional Sensor System (NTSS) will be tested on an instrumented range.

Tern
Complete Tern, a joint Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) effort, previously funded in Program Element (PE) 0603123N Force Protection Advanced Technology Development. Continue TERN technology development by conducting hardware and software testing and a sea-based Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) flight demonstration. The developed Tern enabling technologies have been focused on supporting a DDG-51 and LCS-2 based future long endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) capability that could be transitioned and implemented with minimal ship modification.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NDAA 19 amends the Chairman’s responsibilities to address experimentation on future concepts and the 2018 National Defense Strategy Implementation Guidance directs that rigorous experimentation take place on concepts to ensure Department investments adequately address future requirements as well as those of today. As such, the Joint Staff will establish an experimentation capability to analyze and validate priority joint concept required capabilities. 

Concept analysis and validation will have a multi-faceted nature to meet the Chairmen’s Title 10 responsibility of, “identifying new joint military capabilities based on advances in technology and concepts of operation, and recommending investments and experiments in such capabilities.” Wargames will assess baseline mission and campaign level outcomes of the concepts as well as identify a tradespace of potential new capabilities. This tradespace of capabilities is further explored with quantitative models and software that identify the most efficient cost and capability tradeoffs to help meet the Title 10 responsibility of “advising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.” 

The National Defense Strategy directs “early design tradeoffs in the requirements process to increase the speed of delivery.” The Joint Staff approach to tradespace exploration follows that guidance by providing a cost conscious and operationally relevant prioritization tradeoff technique early in the portfolio design process. Using this rigorous prioritization approach, the capability development cycle can efficiently focus resources on more detailed experimentation of specific capabilities to inform the requirements process. The analysis from the experimentation program will be used to provide foundational evidence to directly inform the Joint Military Net Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman’s Program Recommendation (CPR), and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is the organization within the Department of Defense chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements, joint operational concepts, and operational architectures.  As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues.  JIAMDO is the operational community’s proponent for requirements and capabilities in IAMD, and is the joint IAMD proponent within the DoD’s resource allocation structures.  JIAMDO also leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, conducts evaluations, demonstrations of joint IAMD architectures, and provides advocacy for innovative, technically mature, and affordable solutions.

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to facilitate coordination of integration issues and requirements.  In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs, and assesses the validity of those criteria in relation to national and military requirements.  At the request of USSTRATCOM and direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM in the development of the IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System.  JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture.  JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and technical oversight of homeland capability solutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO) is chartered to plan, coordinate, and oversee Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements, concepts, and architectures. As part of the Joint Staff, JIAMDO supports the Chairman in meeting his Title 10 responsibilities as they relate to IAMD issues. JIAMDO is the IAMD proponent for requirements and capabilities within the DoD’s resource allocation system. JIAMDO leads IAMD mission and utility analysis, integrates IAMD within the force protection joint capability area, and conducts evaluations of joint IAMD architectures. 

JIAMDO has established a close partnership with Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and maintains liaison offices at major CCMD locations to coordinate integration issues and requirements. In particular, JIAMDO maintains close coordination with U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) in support of ballistic missile defense of the United States. JIAMDO provides the CJCS and the Joint Requirements Oversight Council the ability to meet statutory responsibilities to review cost, schedule, and performance criteria of Missile Defense Agency missile defense programs. At the request of USSTRATCOM and at the direction of the CJCS, JIAMDO supports USSTRATCOM development of IAMD prioritized capabilities list and the global integrated IAMD assessment and analysis of the Ballistic Missile Defense System. JIAMDO supports the USSTRATCOM ballistic missile early warning mission by ensuring operational and technical requirements are integrated into the theater missile warning architecture. JIAMDO also provides direct support to North American Aerospace Defense Command and USNORTHCOM for homeland air and cruise missile surveillance issues and homeland defense solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) program supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Title 10, Section 153 statutory responsibilities for the analytical support, management, development, evaluation, and implementation of joint concepts in order to advance the operational effectiveness of the future Joint Force and enable the introduction of new capabilities. The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's statutory responsibility to provide “best military advice” to the SECDEF and POTUS by expressing his vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20 year horizon; identifying joint force development implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The overarching goal is to enable investment decisions between near and far term. Concepts drive horizontal integration for force development across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. An intent of the Joint Concepts program is to support senior leader decisions in balancing today’s requirements and future force requirements. Key deliverables include:  

Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO) that provides the Chairman's vision for the future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations. 

Family of Joint Concepts, based on National Military Strategy (NMS), provides operational approaches to future challenges or opportunities with respect to Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations in order to guide current and future Joint Force development. 

Joint Concept Transition Plans, developed for each joint concept, document approaches for Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes in the future Joint Force and identifies conceptual ideas that may require further exploration.  

Joint Operating Environment (JOE) describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force so it can anticipate and prepare for potential conflicts. The JOE articulates the circumstances that are likely to alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. Finally, the JOE provides a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time.

The International Force Development Division’s (IFDD) mission is to ensure collaboration and integration throughout the spectrum of joint force development.  This ensures both the Joint Staff, its allies, and partners can invest in initiatives and conduct interoperable and seamless operations to meet the objectives in the NMS. The Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC) is an initiative led by the United States Joint Staff, J-7, and partners with 22 countries and international organizations.  It is designed to develop and assess non-materiel force development solutions and close capability gaps within multi-national operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The CCJO revision will provide a common view of the future operating environment and a vision for how the future joint force will conduct globally integrated operations.  Also, the revised CCJO will identify force development implications and required capabilities to maintain U.S. competitive advantage against emerging threats out to 2035. In partnership with selected Combatant Commands and the Services, development of the Joint Operating Concepts to address strategic challenges has begun. Prospectuses were developed to initiate Supporting Joint Concepts in the areas of space, intelligence, deterrence, and operating in a CBRN environment. Study of the 2035 operating environment continues and informs understanding of military challenges associated with the common view of the future operating environment.  Work with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries is focused on developing a FVEY common view of the future operating environment culminating in a report due by the end of 2018.  Joint Concept for Integrated Campaigning and the Joint Concept for Operating in the Information Environment completed development and were approved by the VCJCS.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Force Management (GFM) data initiative Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) effort provides the next steps for GFM mission application enhancements required to balance global force demand against available military force. This complex task requires technologies that provide integrated information obtained by linking force structure quantitative data (derived from the GFM organizational servers) to qualitative data of Capability, Readiness, Availability and Employment/Location data (C.R.A.E.) resident in GFM mission applications and associated data bases. The Joint Staff is responsible for GFM allocation and will employ a strategy for efficiently providing Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.

DoD must meet national military objectives that range from large force scenarios to small-scale activities. Our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic effects. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that rapidly and accurately enables force sourcing activities to support SecDef decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service’s organizational server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the health and worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by numerous Joint Staff requirements documents.

The Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) enterprise force structure data integration efforts enables Project ORION: a Global Laydown Server and a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog along with functional applications that support a global visibility capability. This capability enhances resource-informed planning, global force management and joint deployment. Global visibility capability also supports future force integration and concept implementation needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders’ contingency requirements. Project ORION creates a technical environment that enables rapid integration of the JOPES replacement with remaining GFM data that supports planning and execution of U.S. Military Operations. Project Orion provides operational force structure and the means to allocate and attach units. This capability is the cornerstone for fulfilling the CJCS-directed requirement to integrate force planning, support planning, and deployment planning and execution of military operations. The ORION environment supports all variants of planning and execution processes by providing portal access to authoritative data aggregated in the Global Laydown Servers and associated display of force capabilities, readiness, employment, and availability of the force. This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This GFM DI effort within the Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) family of programs will immediately streamline the SECDEFs "Forces for Unified Commands" memorandum Assignment Tables. RDT&amp;E efforts for assignment and apportionment functions ended in FY 2015 with the declaration of Full Operation Capability (FOC) for the Automated Global Force Management Tool. GFM DI planned milestones must be met to enable a global visibility capability. GFM applications managed by the Joint Staff are used by the JSAS family of programs.</r2:Description>

This capability will provide a dynamic representation of military force disposition. GLS algorithms will enable the GFM mission applications to present meaningful information required for timely and accurate decision making to assist the Chairman in providing military advice. The JFCC will serve as a user interface that uses the GLS algorithms to streamline operations planning and GFM execution in support of Combatant Commander requirements. 

The FY 2018 strategy will focus on a unit type capabilities registration functionality within the JFCC that will unify the unit-based readiness and unit type reporting process by obtaining on-hand forces (personnel and equipment) via the EFS (GFM DI) standard format. The FY 2018 incremental development of the JFCC virtual application and associated dynamic force visibility will provide the true inventory of force availability based on Service employable entities (unit types) and sustainability factors, to enable the use of on-hand Service force capabilities identified down to the Service-defined lowest deployable entities for executive decision making and GFM mission execution.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR) provides DoD with a closed-loop network that forms a global live-fire information operations range complex. JIOR uses encrypted tunneling over existing transport networks to conduct mission rehearsal, training, testing, concept development and experimentation in support of Information Operations (IO), Electronic Warfare (EW), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Spectrum Warfare, Space Operations, and Special Operations Forces mission areas in a realistic threat representative environment. JIOR provides the capability to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces on the full spectrum of cyber weapons/capabilities without risk of observation or fratricide. JIOR is unique within the Department of Defense and is accredited by DIA for operations at Unclassified through Top Secret-Special Compartment Information (TS-SCI) in a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) environment. JIOR is approved for use by Special Access Programs (SAP), Special Access Required Programs (SAR), and for Special Technical Operations (STO). JIOR provides Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C/S/A's) and key allied partners the ability to test deployment and collaboratively gain insights into advanced cyberspace and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environments. JIOR integrates available cyberspace ranges with the training/test audience providing access to low density/high demand test and training resources including critical infrastructure, cyber targets, internet traffic, and opposing forces. JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments.  C/S/A’s conduct hundreds of mission rehearsal, training, testing, and experimentation events on the JIOR annually.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Simulation System (JSS)

- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)

- Air Force JNTC

- Navy JNTC

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through training experiences using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training that improves interoperability and realism of tactical and operational joint training between the Services and USSOCOM. JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing relevant joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support the Services and USSOCOM in their requirement to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving, rather than consuming readiness and creating a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JSS:  The Joint Simulation System, consisting of the Joint Theater Level Simulation and the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation, provides a low cost, distributed or deployable, web-based joint training capability with a small technical and operator footprint.  JSS funding provides warfighters with joint simulations and tools that enhance and enable joint training across Services, Combatant Commands, Combat Support Agencies, NATO, and multinational partners. The joint simulations and tools provided by JSS funding are critical enablers that support the delivery of trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JSS intent is to maintain a capability to share simulation environments with coalition partners by continuing limited investments ensuring Joint Theater Level Simulation and Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation remain relevant providing reliable, low-cost, small footprint, distributed, and deployable joint training solutions. 
 
JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based joint operations core curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training (externally funded); and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&amp;E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 program goals and objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.

Air Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment. Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Investment in the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program enables Service and Combatant Commands to train as they operate. The funding requested continues to modernize joint training capabilities into a single integrating architecture aligned to DoD Chief Information Officer IT mandates. Funding supports the development of cloud-enabled modular training application services. Program intent is to reduce dependence on touch labor, and mitigate the impact of reductions in operation and sustainment funding. Momentum must be maintained to deliver operationally relevant training environments and respond to changes in global security landscape and the warfighters' operational environment. JNTC enables the Department of Defense to be responsive to the warfighters’ changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices. In FY 2018, this investment continues expanding capabilities and access for Service and Combatant Command trainers to plan and execute joint training. Funds support improved relevance and realism of training by providing capabilities that replicate the contemporary and future operating environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>JNTC provides the technical standards, architecture (blueprint), and development processes required to integrate joint training programs.  The Joint Training Environment (JTE) is envisioned as an integrated network of training sites and nodes with accessible joint training and force development services.  By leveraging existing training programs and initiating programmatic actions, JNTC develops credible opposing force capabilities and expanded access to assets typically unavailable to the training audience. These capabilities enhance the integration of joint training objectives into Service training events.  RDT&amp;E funding supports the technical integration of Joint and Service modeling and simulation training capabilities.  The resulting capabilities enable selective aggregation of training audiences at the Combatant Command, Joint Task Force, and Component Command headquarter levels.  The funding increases warfighter access to semi-automated training enablers within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment through web-based, modular cloud capabilities. 

The Adaptive Training Capability Program (ATCP) is a subordinate component of JNTC that enables the joint force to be responsive to the warfighters’ changing operational concepts, threat environments, and best practices.  ATCP funding advances joint capabilities and interoperability by addressing emerging joint training requirements through a managed set of globally distributed joint live, virtual, and constructive enablers.  ATCP funding promotes joint context to Service training programs and joint enablers supporting Combatant Command training requirements and high interest training issues identified in the Chairman’s annual training guidance.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is DoD's authoritative source for online joint training.  JKO is a DoD enterprise-wide, Joint individual training toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, and Combat Support Agencies, interagency, and multinational) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members for tasks that are jointly executed, resulting in trained, capable, and interoperable joint forces.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the joint content management architecture including:  

1. JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. JKO LCMS is necessary to develop, host and deliver JKO courses, track and report students’ progress, completions and survey results more effectively and efficiently. JKO LCMS extends web-based, distributed access to mission-critical joint training requirements. There are currently over 2.7 million registered users of the JKO LCMS.

2. Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. Specifically, C/JTF "battle staffs" will be adequately trained, as individuals and as collective staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses enable blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises that augment the joint event learning cycle and support  meeting Combatant Commander exercise objectives.

3. JKO mobile application training device development:  Development and enhancements facilitate the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (cell phones and tablets).  JKO mobile application extends access to training courses and learning resources to personal use of mobile phones and tablets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities increase access to, and facilitate the training and preparation of, hundreds of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command (CCMD) theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets.  JKO LCMS development and enhancements are required to develop, host, deliver, track, report and support students’ completions, progress and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  C/JTF “battle staffs” will be better trained, as individuals and as staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO mobile courseware training device development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for DoD personnel.</r2:Description>

Develop, test and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  Requirements will be derived from CCMD user feedback and DoD training priorities directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness and the Chairman’s training guidance. The objectives are to provide a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit, and develop content for pre-exercise training and support (as required by the Services) and support individual and unit training for Special Purpose - Marine Air Ground Task Force missions.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and the ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~550,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  Improvements to the JKO LCMS will directly benefit thousands of individuals by providing them global 24/7 access to mandatory joint training as they prepare to participate in CCMD exercises and real world missions. JKO will also focus on enhancements to improve the management of individuals’ training records and readiness reporting by extending information sharing and web services with DoD personnel management systems.  

2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for CCMD exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations.  The SGST will be used as part of the OSD-endorsed blended learning training component in approximately eight CCMD collective training exercises to prepare individuals serving on CCMD required small functional teams and C/JTF "battle staffs."  

3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing its comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile application and mobile training products. JKO’s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO mobile application. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>These programs support readiness of the joint force by creating a joint training environment to replicate the complex and changing operational environment.  These investments directly support defense strategic guidance and enhance joint warfighting readiness by building training capabilities that support the operational readiness of the force.  The elements associated with this coordinated effort consist of:

- Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC)

- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Interoperability Division (JID)

- Marine Corps Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training to improve interoperability and create realistic tactical and operational joint training.  JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&amp;E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.

Air Force JNTC:  The Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment.  Air Force supports development of cross-domain solutions that enable the integration of systems with disparate security requirements which significantly increases the training audience to additional joint and coalition participants.  Additionally, the Air Force supports the integration of tactical models into the virtual environment.  

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, test and evaluation, and cross-service architecture certification on joint-capable systems.  Additionally, the program develops cross-domain architectures for U.S. and coalition forces and ensures sister service modeling/simulation and instrumentation efforts follow a unified standard.

JID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.

Marine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations.  In support of the Commandant’s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. 

ADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the DoD unique and authoritative source for online joint training.  JKO is tasked to develop a DoD enterprise-wide, joint individual training toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, Combat Support Agencies, Interagency, and multinational partners) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members on tasks that are jointly executed.  JKO research and development will improve all components of the Joint Content Management Architecture (JCMA) including:  

1. JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. There are currently over 3.6 million registered users of the JKO LCMS.

2. Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses significantly enhance blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises.

3. JKO mobile application training development:  Development and enhancements will significantly increase availability and access of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (e.g. cell phones and tablets).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities increase access to, and facilitate the training and preparation of, hundreds of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command (CCMD) theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets.  JKO LCMS development and enhancements are required to develop, host, deliver, track, report and support students’ completions, progress and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  C/JTF “battle staffs” will be better trained, as individuals and as staffs, based on SGST development and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO mobile courseware training development facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for DoD personnel.</r2:Description>

Develop, test, and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~560,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  

2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO LCMS.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for Combatant Command and Service exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations. Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  

3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing a comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile capability and mobile training products via Responsive Design. JKO’s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.</r2:Text>

2. JKO will research, develop, test, and evaluate a virtual classroom (VClass) open source capability (Sakai) to be integrated into the JKO LCMS suite of tools for synchronous (live) and non-synchronous (video-taped) instructor led training as well as a micro learning technology (Pervasive Learning System (PERLS)), in conjunction with ADL, for content development and delivery on both the mobile and LCMS platforms. JKO’s new VClass capability will provide required enhanced distributed learning (DL) much like today’s universities with an expectation of student-to-instructor collaboration; student-to-student collaboration; written assignment evaluation; live instructor response and teaching; and critical thinking exercises and assignments.  PERLS delivers self-regulated micro-learning training that is designed to be engaging, usable and practical, allowing individuals to quickly access desired learning content whenever an opportunity arises. As DoD organizations increase training via DL opportunities to mitigate expenses due to decreased funding and personnel, the methodologies of developing and delivering DL must be cutting edge, timely and optimize the learning experience of the joint warfighter.  PERLS and micro-learning provide that edge and optimization.</r2:Text>

These systems are tailored to prepare operational Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for worldwide deployment in support of CCMD operations and engagements and are available to any organization or entity training via the JLVC federation of training tools.  Based on the Commandant's planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-multi-resolution federation bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  The MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also provides a single source training environment capability that enables users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems easing the burden of requesting terrain, 3D models, and other geographic layers into a single source. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also enhances pattern of life (PoL) / indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers the ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into the training scenarios.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This ensures Marine Corps planners and the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) capabilities involved in these development effort synchronize outcomes with warfighter requirements.  Performance metrics include, but are not limited to: time, money, realism, and fidelity and are defined below.

Time – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to prepare and execute training more timely than current capabilities allow.

Cost – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to prepare and execute training at a more effective and efficient cost than current capabilities allow.

Realism – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to create a training environment that is closer to the real world environment than current capabilities allow.

Fidelity – Will the effort enable the Joint Force Trainer (subject matter expert) to create more detailed capabilities in the training environment than current capabilities allow.
The Marine Corps will provide key elements of the proposed change that will allow the USMC to structure a variety of LVC enhancements in a more cost-effective manner to support training efforts within the GRF, NATO, CCMDs, SP-MAGTF and other deploying forces.  By expanding the capabilities of existing capabilities through partnerships and cost-sharing efforts that focus on emerging theater training requirements, the changes proposed herein leverage cloud and other technologies to provide the training necessary to address several DoD goals and objectives listed in Commandant's planning guidance and Chairman’s joint training guidance.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supporting basic research provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical knowledge underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.

The Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative (MRI), and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (VBFF).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research Initiatives project, P010, includes Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR) and the Minerva Research Initiative.

SSBR supports oversight, policies, and initiatives to implement the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering's (USD(R&amp;E)) strategic plan for defense basic research.  This plan defines actions to help create conditions for defense basic research investments capable of producing high-payoff, transformative scientific breakthroughs for the Department.  SSBR initiatives support the five Basic Research Office strategic goals:  (1) drive the direction of DoD basic research investments; (2) coordinate and conduct oversight of DoD basic research programs; (3) improve the science and engineering workforce and public outreach; (4) enhance university-industry collaboration; and (5) engage with the academic research community and international partners.

The Minerva Research Initiative, a Department of Defense basic research program in the social sciences directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), funded in partnership with Air Force and Navy University Research Initiatives, and executed by the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, seeks to build a fundamental understanding of the sources of present and future conflict.  It is one of the Nation’s only social science basic research programs in support of national security.  Minerva promotes a deeper understanding of the social and cultural environments, where threats such as radicalization and regional instabilities develop, and supports more effective strategic and operational policy decisions.  Minerva program priorities are consistent with the goals set forth in the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), informing DoD efforts to effectively build security globally, and are updated annually according to inputs from across the defense enterprise.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes additional projects aligned with recent Congressional interest, such as those on peer and near-peer statecraft, supported by the Congressional increase to the Minerva budget.

Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DEPSCoR) is a legislated program that helps build the national infrastructure for research and education by funding research activities in science and engineering (S&amp;E) responsive to the needs of national defense. Participation in this program is limited to states that meet eligibility criteria as outlined in the authorizing language. The program is intended to increase the number of university researchers and improve the capabilities of institutions of higher education (IHEs) in eligible jurisdictions to perform competitive S&amp;E research relevant to the Department. IHEs in eligible states will be invited to compete for awards in areas identified by the Department in broad agency announcements.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) fosters and enhances the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to access high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) personnel vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  NDEP’s portfolio includes workforce development programs, such as the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program; Military family programs, such as the Military Child Pilot Program (MCPP); STEM Education and Outreach; and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) increasing STEM proficiency in the Nation by enabling an increased capacity to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) shaping the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts and coordinating STEM efforts in alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) identifying approaches for innovative solutions in support of the Nation's current and future defense challenges.

The NDEP aligns to the National Defense Strategy and the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) priorities.  The program is synchronized with the Federal Five-Year STEM Education Strategic Plan, the DoD STEM Strategic Plan, the DoD Strategic Workforce Plan, and the DoD Agency Strategic Plan.  NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation practices as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

The SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 21 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience.  Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 2,800 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 2,000 students have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment.  Approximately 1,200 have completed their service commitment to the Department.  SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The MCPP enhances the preparation of dependents of members of the Armed Forces for careers in STEM and provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.

STEM Education and Outreach fosters activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department’s competitive edge.  In order to build a necessary workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts, as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.

The DoD is constantly looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Description: SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 21 academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce needed by DoD.  

The disciplines align with the Department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas, and include:  Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.  In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,200 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 70 percent of those participants are still employed by DoD.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are college students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new talent for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in relevant hands-on research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience.

Since FY 2005, approximately 2,800 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 190 sponsoring facilities.  As of October 2018, approximately 2,000 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) in fields of science and engineering that are important to national defense.  The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI program encourages participation of small minority schools as well as large minority research institutions.  The program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 2362 and is funded by annual appropriations.  This competitive program provides support through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for research, education assistance, and instrumentation purchases.

Work in this PE provides a foundation to enhance participation of HBCUs/MIs in DoD research, including infrastructure; strengthen research and educational opportunities at HBCUs/MIs and increase the number of minority graduates in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines important to the national defense; and build a more diverse pool of scientists and engineers to meet future workforce needs.

Work in this PE is performed by the Services’ Research Offices and DoD Laboratories (includes the Army Research Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory) for Centers of Excellence (COE).  Centers currently funded through cooperative agreements include COEs in Autonomy, Cyber Security, Research Data Analysis, and STEM Scholars.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The Department of Defense (DoD) HBCU/MI Program encourages participation of small minority schools and large minority research institutions.  This competitive program provides support through grants or contracts for research, education assistance, instrumentation purchases, and technical assistance as described below.

•  Research.  The research grants are to further the knowledge in the basic scientific disciplines through theoretical and experimental activities.  Collaborative research allows university professors to work directly with military laboratories or other universities.

•  Education.  Education assistance funds are used by minority institutions to strengthen their academic programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), thereby increasing the number of under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate and graduate degrees in these fields.  These grants provide equipment, scholarships, cooperative work/study opportunities, visiting faculty programs, summer internship programs, and a variety of other enhancements designed to support students and to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM.

•  Instrumentation purchases.  The program allows universities to purchase basic laboratory equipment, such as lasers and spectrometers, for enhancements to the basic research efforts.

•  Technical assistance.  The funds are used to design programs that enhance the ability of minority institutions to successfully compete for future Defense funding by assisting the HBCU/MI community in areas such as proposal writing and administration of grants and contracts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts.  Increasing the lethality, range, and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments.  

Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) have been established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2023 and 2028 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their Insensitive Munitions (IM) Strategic Plans / Fuze Technology Development Plan, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate.  The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) will utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives, plus senior Munitions PEO representatives), to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Insensitive Munitions (IM) Technology Program (JIMTP) aims to develop the enabling technologies needed to build weapons in compliance with statutory requirements (United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389) and regulation (DoDI 5000.1 and 5000.02, and CJCSI 3170.01F).  This effort will take promising technologies developed at the laboratory scale and mature them for transition into advanced technology (Budget Activity (BA) 6.3) programs based on the priority munitions identified in the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  Mature and demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned to the Program Executive Officers (PEOs), thereby decreasing the program costs and schedule risk.  This will additionally promote spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within the DoD portfolio.  Without new technologies and new increased performance explosive materials and propellants, future variants of current weapon systems will have the same, or worse, response to IM stimuli.  New weapon developments will face similar challenges and the US will be outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.  This is especially true with increased performance requirements for improved and new systems. 

The JIMTP investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area that are used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plans.  The program is structured around these five areas with clear cross-cutting tasks.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>HPP focuses on the development of technologies to improve the IM response of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization, and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment and Bullet Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of HPP rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large HPP motors.  Additional goal is to improve range to 2 times our current capabilities, with improvements in the IM responses.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>AAW focuses on the development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies for improving IM of AAW munitions.  The development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead and fuze technologies, when applied to munitions, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintain munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, new ingredient synthesis and characterization, initial formulation development, scale-up, warhead/charge configuration, venting techniques for both munitions and their containers, protection/packaging materials and systems, shock mitigation liners, and initiation devices, techniques, and technologies.  Applications vary but include high performance warhead fills, booster explosives, and all other technology to mitigate the violent response of AAW munitions to IM threats.  Munition operating conditions may be controlled or have widely varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and vibration, and other factors such as cost, availability, and reliability may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the AAW MATGs are concentrated on solving the IM response of anti-armor warheads to the Fragment Impact and Slow Cook-off, threats for larger and Medium Caliber Munitions.</r2:Description>

The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, gun propellant formulations, ingredients for gun propellant formulations, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up, cartridge case and packaging design, active and passive venting techniques, reduced sensitivity primer propellant and primer systems, and robust primers for insensitive propellants.  Applications vary, but include both large and medium caliber munitions, as well as propelling charges for mortars and shoulder launched munitions.  Operating requirements vary, and other factors such as barrel life and operation over varying environmental conditions may be critically important depending on the intended munition application.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the GP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of gun propulsion munitions to Fragment Impact and Slow and Fast Cook Off threats, with a focus on high performance gun propulsion systems designed for extended range and increased lethality in 2028 and 2033.</r2:Description>

This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority  capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities. Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.  

The Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) investments are focused on capability areas that have been validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. The four capability areas are: 
1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hard Target Fuzing challenges are grouped into three technology areas.  First, improved modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the fuze environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2018, $5.253 million of the $47.891 million is being executed under the Technical Intelligence, Project code 535.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Lincoln Laboratory (LL) research project 534 is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The LL project supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components, and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds ten technology areas.  Note: In FY 2019, the Cyber efforts moved to an individual project code 815.

Of the technology areas, there are five core-technology areas:  Advanced Devices; Optical Systems and Technology; Information, Computation and Exploitation; Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technology; and Cyber Security, Science and Engineering.  There are four emerging-technology initiatives:  Advanced Materials and Processes; Quantum System Sciences; Biomedical Sciences and Technology; and Autonomous Systems.  There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. 

These ten technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual projects in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence, project 535.  The Technical Intelligence Program provides global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Cyber Security, Science and Engineering under project code 815 starting in FY 2019.  The Cyber Security, Science and Engineering research project 815 supports innovative research that addresses critical national security problems in cyber. The project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, and algorithms in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Investments in optical-based technologies can fill the critical technology gaps in emerging DoD threat areas, such as anti-access/area denial (A2/AD), counter–weapons of mass destruction (C-WMD), and asymmetric warfare. Optical systems and technologies will also improve capabilities using new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in traditional DoD mission areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), space control, communications, and ballistic missile defense.</r2:Description>

Research in computing-intensive algorithms as well as more capable focal plane arrays will demonstrate higher resolution images. Until now, a laser radar on a large aircraft produced three-dimensional (3D) images only after hours of processing on the ground. Development of a small laser radar in FY 2018 will allow real-time 3D images on a small unmanned air vehicle. Microwave radars with multiple receivers have many advantages including multiple look angles, stealthy receivers, and higher resolution. Research with simultaneous microwave beams and optical beacons will explore techniques to overcome synchronization and coherent combining difficulties. The ability for wavelength agility will become as important in the optical domain as it is for microwave electronic warfare. So, development of multi-wavelength imaging spectrometers, long-wavelength infrared laser radars, and wavelength-agile short pulse lasers will provide continued capability growth while ensuring that deployed countermeasures in overused optical regions will not thwart DoD capabilities.</r2:Text>

Several efforts are augmenting the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neuro-technologies (BRAIN) initiative being led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and The National Institutes of Health (NIH), and include the development of algorithms for cellular resolution brain mapping, the design and prototyping of neuron-size, biocompatible sensors for in-vivo neural monitoring, as well as the design and development of novel sensors for imaging systems to make them portable for use in the field and office to diagnose post-traumatic stress or brain injury, and to conduct real time cognitive load assessment for the warfighter. Sensorimotor tracking of neurological disorders in a large virtual reality environment is informing the detection of mTBI, with a focus on transitioning a simplified version of the capability to clinical settings. Other efforts are targeted at developing and implementing novel model systems and sensors, medical support tools, and the application of big data analytics to areas such as medical image analysis. Novel model systems and sensors include: the Lincoln Laboratory Artificial Gut that is helping to decipher the complex relationship between the nervous system and the microbiome, which has been correlated with depression and stress, as well as neuro-generative diseases including Parkinson’s Disease; and development, design and prototyping of an engineered sensor platform capable of real-time monitoring of health biomarkers in the body or in body fluids. Novel medical support tools include: a novel hearing aid design that uses deep neural networks to reduce the cognitive burden of isolating a single speaker in background noise, which is of relevance for normal and hearing impaired warfighters; and implementation of artificial intelligence to develop a system for field forward casualty care that reduces the burden on medics providing combat casualty care.</r2:Text>

These improvements rely on continuing research in multi-agent coordination and machine learning algorithms. One learning algorithm project will emulate biological thinking for adapting to changing knowledge. Advances in autonomous systems rely not only on improved algorithms, but also better interfaces between hardware and algorithms, as well as more suitable hardware. This project area will conduct research into better tactile interfaces for grasping and manipulation, with an additional focus on building autonomous systems that will perform within prescribed performance bounds. These research thrusts will have important applications in autonomous robot augmentation for the warfighter. Also, being aware that the noise of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can compromise its mission, work on an electroaerodynamic (EAD) propulsion system will lead to sustained noiseless flight. In addition, a study will provide an autonomous undersea mapping framework for future efforts.</r2:Text>

A concept for autonomous undersea mapping, developed in FY 2018, will be tested in a tank, and then in an initial ocean test, in FY 2019. As swarms become more important work on algorithms, for resilience in degraded environments and risk taking by one for the good of all, are being developed. Work on human machine teaming, including algorithm and scenario development, can begin to enable robots to learn, co-adapt to their human counterparts, and share decision-making authority dynamically. Facilitate operations in uncertain, complex and dynamic environments by algorithm development for 3D semantic map construction and for autonomous task execution in simulated environments. Finally, another new effort is bringing tools from AI to complex air and missile defense scenarios to help facilitate the effective allocation and coordination of heterogeneous resources in real time against a large number of threats, with infrequent direct war fighter input. Incorporation of algorithms from the commercial world will hasten the development of autonomous systems for the DoD. Incorporation of technology improvements from the commercial world will lead to improvements in lower Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) systems.</r2:Text>

Research takes advantage of these states to produce secure quantum networks and quantum computers, which, in principle, can do calculations far beyond the ability of any classical computer. A quantum communications system has been built over an in-ground fiber in the Boston metropolitan area. This system will continue to develop and test a robust and secure quantum network with applicability to a secure core network for the DoD. Quantum computing could have important implications for solving DoD problems that are intractable on classical computers. Multiple techniques for overcoming technical difficulties are being investigated. For example, advances in control and measurement of trapped ion and superconducting qubits will enable the development of noise correlation measurements and error correction techniques. These advances are a requirement for quantum computers. FY 2018 plans also include design of a fieldable, high-precision vector magnetometer based on advances in quantum magnetometry. This project area will also investigate electric field measurements that are based on the same physics and that employ much the same hardware as used for the magnetometer.</r2:Text>

The 3D space-based ladar effort will continue with risk reduction in key areas, including data-registration for forming 3D image and space optics technology. The project will accelerate the design of a future generation micro-air vehicle (MAV) for integrating advanced power, guidance, control, and payloads. Maturation of wafer-scale integration processes will lead to development of designs for applying these processes to small satellite systems.</r2:Text>

Technology development for agile low altitude (~200 kilometers) microsatellites is new, and has a focus on reducing risk for key enabling technologies including low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) propulsion and optical communications. Also new is the development and demonstration of a mobile diamond magnetometer, with quantum stability and solid-state vector measurement capability, to provide a jam resistant, navigation alternative for GPS-denied environments. The wafer-scale small satellite bus effort will continue to focus on system and payload design toward wafer-scale integration, and propulsion system design, fabrication, test and incorporation. The plan is to develop a highly integrated wafer-scale small satellite bus with a basic payload. The future generation Micro Air Vehicle project will continue to focus on integrating advanced sensing payloads and advanced autonomous system processing control algorithms.</r2:Text>

Research into novel approaches for computer hardware/software design will guide the design and development of a fundamentally new computing system that is inherently secure and can ensure mission success even when compromised. This effort will be complemented by developing a data-centric approach to ensuring self-protection of data throughout storage, computation and transit. Research into cyber resilient approaches for mission assurance includes the development and implementation of a secure processing engine for autonomous systems, and the development and validation of an automated capability for contested environments where a host may be disabled or compromised. Other cyber efforts include further developing the capability to automatically generate effective cyber courses of action for evolving threat environments such as damage by an attacker after network penetration, securing small satellites against the growing threat of cyber-attack, and securing the ability to compute on private data without revealing it and demonstrating this capability for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application.</r2:Text>

Specifically:
• TW/HS Tool Exploitation: ($3.5M) will continue to support the operational TW/HS toolkit, TechSight, which is available to DoD researchers and scientists, and focus on expanding it to provide quicker data analytics for TW/HS to support decision making through the inclusion of DoD contract, small business innovation research (SBIR) and grant award information. These developments will allow for strategic analysis of S&amp;T and acquisition investments to inform technology, engineering, &amp; acquisition decisions. The program will identify outreach opportunities to inform and train DoD S&amp;T organizations in the usage of analytical tools and methodologies to support “in-house” decision making and expand organizational knowledge into emerging technology areas of strategic interest.
• Technical Assessment Program: ($0.5M) will sponsor multiple technical assessment activities that support the community of interest topic areas and more emphasis will be placed on conducting impact assessments of emerging technologies. These assessments will inform the S&amp;T community on direction for future capabilities to support joint and cross domain missions. 
• Intel Support to S&amp;T: ($1.0M) will provide a bridge between the intelligence community (IC) and the S&amp;T community to access the most relevant intelligence analysis, coordinate integration of intelligence with capability development, and conduct Red Cell assessments to inform technology investment shaping and strategic direction. An additional function will be to produce an annual S&amp;T Intelligence Needs Plan providing the IC a formal understanding of intelligence requirements for the R&amp;D community. 
• Wargaming: ($0.5M) will integrate emerging threats from kill chain analysis and potentially disruptive technologies from horizon scanning efforts through the DoD wargaming community to better understand the potential of emerging technologies to better inform both the DoD requirements process and the technical capability development process.</r2:Text>

Preparing for Enhanced Energetic Materials: An affordable CL-20: The singular solution to range and energy challenges is to make both propellant formulations (for range) and explosive formulations (for energy) using the most powerful, mature energetic crystal, CL-20. Current use of CL-20 is extremely limited because of its cost of large-scale manufacture ($1,000/lb). The proposed work intends to achieve new, cheaper, high-yield, production routes to CL-20.
- Research CL-20 production with fewer organic synthesis reactions, thereby reducing production costs; these reactions will employ commercially available metal catalysts, instead of the current expensive Palladium catalyst required.
- Pursue the CL-20 precursor known as TetraAcetylDiAminohexaazaisowurtzitane (TADA), utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) starting materials.
- Work on small-scale mixing of CL-20 propellant formulations to achieve reasonable viscosity, pot life, mechanical and safety properties.

Development of Prototype Soft Epidermal Biosystems with Advanced Sensing Capabilities for Warfighters in Triage Settings: To develop a wireless epidermal system that integrates flexible electronics and a range of biosensors to provide rapid vital sign screening solution for battlefield triage of combat casualties. 
- Development of stretchable circuit and biosensor designs.
- Integration of soft elastomeric substrates and fluidic channel.
- Validation of porcine animal model and test conditions for future evaluation of novel epidermal biosystems.
- Evaluation of epidermal biosystems in porcine animal models and clinical settings.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology tactics, the cyber Science and Technology (S&amp;T) community must remain agile, vigilant, and evermore creative in response.  Starting in late FY 2016, the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) reviewed new cyber threats and the emerging needs of the joint operational community.  As a result, a new strategic vision was developed to enhance the DoD’s tactical edge in a rapidly evolving cyber domain.  Beginning in FY 2018, the following new projects were initiated in the research areas (described below): 

•	Behavioral Cyber Science:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond binary electronic signals towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral science will increase the effectiveness of tools, increase the effectiveness of the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber science seeks to uncover details about how humans (represented by operators, users, adversaries, and/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood, from a behavioral science standpoint, and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcomes.

•	Self-Securing Systems:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to protect the increasingly complex weapon systems and platforms that help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Exploring foundational research in self-securing systems will arm future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly assess cyber threats.  Additionally, future systems will be able to deploy self-defense mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks, and enable blue forces to maneuver at will.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the most current advances in artificial intelligence research.

•	Precise Cyber Effects:  Precision offensive campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired outcomes from cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.  Exploring methods to derive quantifiable metrics will help improve the precision control of selecting cyber mission targets and raise the accuracy of effects; achieving an understanding of second and third order of effects will provide commanders with a higher confidence of success and limit collateral damage.

•	Applied Mathematics:  Advancing mathematical foundations that are intrinsically linked to all branches of cyber science and technology, will cut across focus areas producing new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  This area of research will characterize the cyber domain, maintain the integrity of data, harden systems, and analyze potential solutions. 

Advances in these cyber S&amp;T areas will promote strong foundations, while disruptive innovations will create surprise, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas are critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cybersecurity beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Research in behavioral cyber science will advance the understanding and technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities which will ultimately enhance cyber operations through planning, and training.  Future research must broaden the scope beyond the impacts of cyber actions on equipment to include the impact that these cyber actions will have on human behavior and our adversary’s forces.  Just as an adversary’s behavior may be better understood using behavioral cyber science, behavioral science can be used to improve the actions of cyber defenders and the performance of the cyber workforce.  Data gleaned from observing effects of various cyber operations on users’ productivity, performance, and security will help the DoD design better techniques and processes for use in cyber defense and operation.</r2:Description>

The initial framework for platforms will be developed for U.S. Cyber Command and tested in-house using observer tablets.  Research will build a better understanding of the cyber information environment by developing Cyber Mission Force (CMF) knowledge acquisition and observational assessments. 

"Designing a Contextualized Operator Perspective (COP) to Enable Joint Cyber Operations” project identifies key cyber terrain, defined as the overlap between protected mission’s system needs and the supporting network, to uncover potential threats for Cyber Protection Team (CPT).  The discovery supports CPT analyses for developing technical and data requirements for preliminary work support systems.

                                                    <r2:Description>The pervasive nature of software-reliant systems in today’s modern military creates new opportunities for sophisticated adversaries.  The vast majority of DoD weapons systems, platforms, and networks rely on software to operate.  Software can often be disrupted remotely, which necessitates a new kind of security to protect against such cyber-attacks.  Defending the software and network-based aspects of critical weapon systems is challenging for a number of reasons, chief among which is the advanced nature of the adversary in the cyber realm.  Future cyber adversaries will be well-funded, well-informed, and agile.  Building weapon systems, platforms, and networks that defend themselves in real time will be vital in protecting ourselves against this adversary.  The Department needs systems that can autonomously monitor and manage their own health and security posture through advanced sensing and perception, reasoning, and planning.  Such systems identify and classify threats much more quickly than a human operator, and therefore, neutralize the threat more quickly and effectively.  However, researchers must be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences of turning security over to autonomous systems.  Verification techniques must be developed to ensure that autonomous and dynamic system changes maintain correct mission-focused capabilities without introducing unintended vulnerabilities.  Conversely, developing techniques to track and audit actions taken by autonomous systems ensures that direct control can be reasserted.</r2:Description>

Research will develop and incorporate aspects of moving target defense (MTD) and deception techniques into the IDS, based on the identification of threats.  The IDS will have the ability to respond proactively to adversary actions and to detect and mitigate cyber threats.  Research will explore the threat taxonomy and fine-tune development of monitoring agents under various platforms.  ROLL CAGE will demonstrate system specific vulnerabilities and protection against cyber-attacks using modularized agents.  These agents will establish systems operation baselines, conduct real-time monitoring, identify abnormalities, and alert users/operators of potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

“Autonomous Intelligent Resilient Systems (AIRS)” will develop a reference architecture for command and control (C2) / Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) software-defined networks.  The architecture allows researchers to harness the predicative analytics of intelligent command and control and battlefield services.  The framework will include network topology of data and the control plane model.

“Self-Securing Systems: Autonomous Cyber Defense” project will develop an autonomous cyber deception system prototype.  The research will design hybrid games and hyper-games for cyber deception used to investigate an AI technique called Reinforcement Learning.  In addition research will develop adversary simulator (in future years to be refined by computer network operations operator survey results).</r2:Text>

The research considers attack scenarios / patterns developed by an ally’s Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) based intrusion detection simulator and tests the technologies using new attack patterns.  The project will host a final demonstration.

AIRS refines the reference architecture, ensuring that the system is able to understand and represent machine understandable languages.  AIRS requires a high level understanding of machine understandable languages to make accurate system diagnoses.  To ensure that the system has situational awareness, researchers will develop a representative simulation test environment with the requisite instrumentation to evaluate AIRS.

Cyber operators often have incomplete information about their targets prior to completing an action. This deficit makes it difficult to predict the precise outcomes or collateral damage caused by a cyber operation. With this uncertainty, military leaders may act with an undue sense of caution in using cyber capabilities. Improving technology and techniques for quantifying cyber effects will increase the effectiveness of cost estimation, enhance consequence prediction and ensure precision. Highly precise and predictable cyber effects can also achieve mission goals despite the presence of both incomplete and maliciously-created false information.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives. The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.

Software is critical to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD) increasing demand for national defense systems that are high-quality, affordable, and deployed in a timely way. With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership in all aspects of software-based system development, operation, defense, and evolution to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research program element (PE) develops and evaluates the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts, with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Insensitive Munitions (IM) effort addresses advanced technology development associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems.  The goal is to develop and demonstrate joint enabling technologies that can be used by program managers as they develop their specific weapon programs.  The program invests in and demonstrates technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus ensuring the development of technology with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts – providing efficiencies and cost savings for the Department.

This effort will demonstrate enabling technologies needed to develop weapons in compliance with IM requirements established in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 and DoD Instruction 5000.1 and 5000.02.  This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based on priority munitions identified in the Program Executive Office (PEO) IM Strategic Plans.  Mature demonstrated IM technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios.  Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.  

The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology Program (JIMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads, 4) Anti-Armor Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion.  Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>HPP focus on the development and demonstration of technologies to improve the IM response of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.  These technologies, when applied to rocket motors, improve IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, rocket propellant ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; reduced smoke or smoky propellants, including formulation, characterization and scale-up; rocket motor case design; materials for active and passive thermal mitigation; shock mitigation materials and techniques; passive and active coatings; active and passive venting techniques for motor cases or containers; ignition systems; sensors; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Operating conditions may be controlled or widely varying in both temperature and vibration.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the HPP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsions systems due to Fragment and Bullet Impacts and Slow Cook Off for the majority of High Performance Propulsion rocket motors, and solving the Fast Cook Off response of very large High Performance Propulsion motors.  Additional goal is to improve range to 2 times our current capabilities, with improvements in the IM responses.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>MSP focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies to improve the IM response of MSP systems.  The development and demonstration of minimum signature (MS) rocket technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve munition IM response to one or more threats, while not degrading the response to other IM threats and, at minimum, maintaining munition performance.  Technologies include, but are not limited to, MS rocket propellant formulations; ingredients for MS propellant formulations, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; case and packaging design; active and passive venting techniques; rocket motor case design; ignition systems; and thrust mitigation techniques.  Of particular interest are technologies toward higher burning rate MS propellants with state-of-the-art energy and reduced shock sensitivity.  The 2023 and 2028 year goals of the MSP MATG are concentrated on solving the IM response of missile propulsion systems due to Fragment Impact, Slow Cook Off, and Shaped Charge Jet (SCJ) threats, as well as improving range to 1.5 times our current capabilities in the near term and 2 times our current capabilities in the out years, with improvements in the IM responses.</r2:Description>

This effort will take promising technologies integrated and tested to technology maturity and demonstrate the technologies to technological maturity utilizing weapon hardware based on
priority capabilities and technology needs identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities. Mature demonstrated fuze technology will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios. 

Under the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP), investments are focused on specific capability areas that have been identified by  department strategic guidance and current shortfalls in weapon systems and validated by the PEOs and Heads of the Service S&amp;T communities. These four capability areas are: 1) Hard Target Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects (TE) Weapon Fuzing, 3) High Reliability Fuzing, and 4) Enabling Fuze Technologies and Common Architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

First, improved modeling and simulation capabilities provide the validated computational tools necessary for hard target applications.  Second, basic phenomenology and understanding of the Fuze Environment is the science-based endeavor of providing the test equipment, instrumentation, and analysis techniques for experimentation and data gathering necessary for next generation fuzing.  Third, hard target survivable fuze components are developed to increase the effectiveness of facility denial munitions by improving the prediction tools and testing methodologies to evaluate the survivability and functionality of legacy and future fuzes.  Development of these technologies will enable next generation boosted and hypersonic penetrators to execute missions against hardened and deeply buried targets.</r2:Description>

Evolving DoD emphasis on increased weapon system reliability is driving the need to consider new and novel approaches for achieving increased fuze reliability while maintaining or enhancing fuze design safety.  DoD policy, higher weapon reliability expectations and harsher weapon system operational requirements are dictating the need for higher fuze reliability than available using current technologies.</r2:Description>

Rested on SUNet are mission specific enclaves used to detect, monitor, understand, and act in the information environment.  The SUNet system addresses critical DoD and interagency requirements for an unclassified, secure information platform that jointly supports rapid innovation and RDT&amp;E, combined operational missions, and mission partner information sharing.  The SUNet provides defense and interagency partners with an accredited platform that enables secure unclassified information sharing, joint analysis, and advanced RDT&amp;E in support of critical operational missions on a global scale. The platform currently supports 5000+ active users and more than a dozen sponsoring agencies with a range of missions, including but not limited to research and analysis of publicly available information, Phase 0 shaping, informing and influencing; building partner capacity; and enables rapid, iterative development and fielding of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The SUNet platform enables CTTSO to identify and develop capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries, and deliver these capabilities to DoD components and interagency partners with a provision of support to US military operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Budget requests these funds in OCO to comply with the base budget defense caps included in the Budget Control Act of 2011.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program identifies capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and quickly delivers these capabilities to U.S. Defense and interagency users, as well as international partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation. CTTS continues to expand its partnerships with other Defense and Interagency, as well as with our foreign partners’ rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users.  CTTS is unique in its approach, annually obtaining joint requirements directly from military and law enforcement operators, intelligence analyst, and first responders.

CTTS recognizes that many of the combating terrorism requirements also support the 2018 National Defense Strategy and will address peer-to-peer high interest areas. These high priority areas include increasing lethal capability of U.S. forces at the squad and small unit level; countering Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (drones) overseas and domestically; tunnel detection and mapping in theater and along the Southwest U.S. border; novel body and vehicle armor; detecting and mitigating novel chemical threats against commercial transportation; telematics; covert communications; and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  From a broader perspective, projects remain distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.

The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. It includes technology capability development, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, and coordination to transition from development to operational use. CTTS manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners. 

The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, Combating Terrorism Technical Support also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTS has earned throughout the Department of Defense and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program increases Joint Force readiness and lethality by providing near-term solutions to existing and future Department of Defense (DoD) capability gaps by leveraging the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) investments of allied nations and coalition partners. The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program Element (PE) evaluates prototypes derived from allied and partner nation technologies to provide the U.S. Armed Services, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and Defense agencies capabilities to counter emerging threats. FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions to meet needs communicated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders. FCT projects are jointly conducted with the Military Services and USSOCOM. FCT strengthens alliances by facilitating international collaboration and evaluating technologies that increase interoperability while serving as a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between international and domestic industries. Partner nations recognize the long-term value of the "two-way street" for Defense procurements FCT provides. Numerous successful projects have resulted in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States, including the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies. To date, companies from 34 states have benefited from FCT projects. FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments. FCT enhances affordability by reducing development costs and risk, accelerating acquisition timelines, and increasing competition. Through increasing Joint lethality and readiness, strengthening alliances, and delivering affordable performance on accelerated timelines, FCT supports all three lines of effort outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. FCT supports the FY2020 Administration R&amp;D Budget Priority of Partnering with Industry by enabling rapid fielding of innovative technologies from the private sector that are easily adaptable to DoD needs. Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&amp;E), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). 

Measurable Outcomes:
-FCT projects will demonstrate capability objectives within 24-36 months.
-Over its 39 year history, FCT has a transition rate of 58% percent (355 out of 610) for completed projects. Of the 355 projects that tested successful, 278 (78%) resulted in follow on procurements of over $11.000 billion.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, OSD, and DOE.  Projects are organized in eight Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The JMP also promotes more in-depth technical exchange via short-term visiting scientist and engineer assignments at both the DOE and the DoD laboratories.

The JMP also works with the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) and the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) of industrial suppliers to equitably and efficiently transition JMP technologies to defense industrial contractors.  

The integrated DoD and DOE efforts within the JMP are transitioning new munitions’ technologies to the Department and the defense industrial base through the advanced development process.  The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 300 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 32 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMP seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM) and insensitive munitions (IM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and safer explosives and propellants, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile and predict lifetimes based on these assessments.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

Each of the 32 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES from the DoD munitions laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Projects in this technical focus area develop physics-based computational tools, material models, and calibration and validation databases that support the design and development of weapon systems.  These capabilities are intended to predict the complex phenomena across significant length (meso to continuum) and time (nano-seconds to minutes) scales.

                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new Energetic Materials (EMs) and supporting technologies to satisfy the competing requirements for smaller, more lethal, and safer munitions.  Work is primarily focused on explosives, gun and rocket propellants, and, to a lesser extent, pyrotechnics.  The projects include development of: 1) new EMs, including new molecules in a range of particle sizes and morphologies, 2) new EM formulations, 3) a fundamental understanding of energetic properties and performance, and 4) computational tools for analysis of performance and sensitivity.  New materials and formulations are developed with the recognition that costs must be reasonable, chemical feed stocks reliable, and manufacturing processes suitable for scale-up to production levels.

Both Federal statute and Department policy direct the development of safer, less sensitive munitions.  Making munitions less sensitive while maintaining explosive or propellant performance is a difficult challenge.  This goal is best attained through a combination of new EM development, EM characterization, and more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  It is cost prohibitive to qualify weapons for compliance with insensitive munitions requirements through testing alone.  A better, and in many cases the only means, to qualify these weapons is with the combination of analysis based on validated computational tools and a few well-designed tests.

The Department also needs munitions that provide selectable effects and improved lethality.  To achieve these effects, weapons designers need to thoroughly understand the performance of EMs used in both the main weapon fill and the initiation systems.  Distributed fuzing systems can provide selectable effects as well as safer munitions, but such complex, small-scale systems require more complete knowledge of EM detonation physics and in some cases, new EMs designed for this application.

The desire for smaller and lighter munitions is driven in part by recommendations of the Long Range Research and Development Program Plan (LRRDPP) and the increasing dependence on unmanned weapons platforms and to some extent by the need to reduce logistical burden, especially energy consumption.  New EMs are needed to meet the munitions weight and size requirements while maintaining and improving lethality, effects, and safety.  

In order to clearly establish overmatch, the Department is working to increase the range and speed of weapons and to develop weapons against hardened targets.  This thrust includes the development of hypersonic and hyper-velocity weapons.  These applications subject EMs to high accelerations and shock loads.  To support the development of these new systems, we need to improve our ability to model EM under higher impact loads and to characterize relevant properties to determine their ability to survive in these aggressive environments.  DoD may also need to develop new, more robust EMs that survive impact loads while maintaining lethality and the ability to initiate weapons under extreme conditions.

TCG-III is also a forum for the exchange of information on new energetic materials, their performance and sensitivity characteristics, and physical models that can be used to predict the behavior of energetics under adverse and unplanned conditions.  It is a venue in which collaboration opportunities can be identified to facilitate the transition of technology developed in the DOE to the DoD.

                                                    <r2:Description>The goals of this technical focus area are to develop new materials, components, diagnostic techniques, and modeling and simulation tools for fuzing systems.  Initiators, fuzes, and sensors must work reliably together to prevent unintended detonation, to correctly detect intended targets, and to initiate detonation when required.  Projects in this focus area support the Department’s needs to miniaturize fuzing systems.  Smaller systems are required for several reasons including: 1) compatibility with smaller and lighter weapons systems, 2) trading volume in munitions for other components such as additional explosives, higher energy and power density power sources, or enhanced guidance systems, 3) increasing reliability through redundancy, for example, using of two or more smaller initiating systems, and 4) upgrading existing sub-munitions with smarter and more reliable fuzing systems. 

The miniaturization of fuzing systems requires new material and components, new power systems, new diagnostic techniques, and improved modeling tools for microdetonics.  The Department also needs weapons systems with selectable effects, and these effects may be achieved with multi-point initiation systems.  Such systems are inherently more complex and require improved characterization of initiator materials and components, as well as more sophisticated modeling and simulation tools.  To attain greater precision and to avoid unintended collateral effects when weapons are used in the complex environment of counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist operations, target sensors must be reliable and provide high-fidelity discrimination.  Projects in this focus area are developing technologies to achieve this level of performance in compact packages.

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports the development of new warheads and penetrator weapons through advances in materials processing and characterization, instrumentation, and computational codes.  Significant increases in warhead performance are directly attributed to our ability to understand and accurately model the physics and fine details of new warhead designs, and to advances in increasingly sophisticated material processing.  The Department’s requirement to achieve more precise weapon effects with minimum collateral damage is supported by work on controlled fragmentation, non-fragmenting warhead cases, and multiphase blast explosives (MBX).  More recently, increases in performance and reductions in vulnerability are being achieved through improved warhead integration into munitions using a systems-oriented approach. 

The goals for penetrator weapons are to investigate, develop, and transition advanced technologies for the design, development, and performance assessment of the next generation of high performance, precision strike weapons.  This effort directly supports national initiatives to defeat hard and deeply buried targets, which are proliferating worldwide, and to deny/defeat weapons of mass destruction.  The work addresses high-velocity penetration into granular materials (sand and soil), penetration into advanced high-strength, high performance, and ultra-high-performance concretes, new penetrator materials and designs, and non-inertial onboard instrumentation.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This focus area supports improving the Department’s ability to understand measure, predict, and mitigate safety and reliability problems caused by materials aging and degradation in weapons systems.  Current stockpile assessment methods typically focus on addressing materials aging and reliability problems after they occur, rather than anticipating, predicting, and avoiding future problems or failure mechanisms.  The overall objective of this work is to develop a toolset of computational models that are able to quantitatively predict materials aging processes and ultimately improve the long-term reliability of weapons systems, subassemblies, and/or components.  These objectives are achieved by identifying aging mechanisms, quantifying the rates at which those aging mechanisms occur, developing predictive models, and using these models to predict the munitions stockpile reliability.  An additional objective of this work is to develop technologies and methodologies to enable munitions health management and condition-based maintenance.

The specific projects in the munitions lifecycle technologies focus area are:
-  Predictive Materials Aging, including solder interconnect reliability, corrosion of electronics, and adhesive degradation.
-  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) reliability.
-  Military use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics.
-  Complex system health assessment.
-  Physical/chemical reactive transport modeling of material/system aging and reliability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports Strategic Intelligence Analysis Cell (SIAC) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) with assessments and analysis to inform the strategic direction of research, development, and acquisition of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States. The analysis uses the operational context of Joint and cross-domain missions by leveraging Combatant Commands (COCOM) and Joint Staff warfighting concepts. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the COCOM.

Analysis and assessments are focused on challenges related to the National Defense Strategy objectives and adversary research and development trends.  Three analysis methods are used: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assess counter technology options, and provide an operational value assessment; and 3) the Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing analytic assessments can span fiscal years and may have multiple phases.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These areas include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, strategic lift, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and others outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely.
Implementation of this process spans multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.

Operational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2020-2040 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development. Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-	KCA across Defense Planning Scenarios and other relevant DoD Vignette to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace.
-	Develop and maintain an all source-like database of military capabilities and a standalone software application, KCA Results Display System, to provide data and analysis on operational issues.
-	Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.
-	Consolidate Technology focused roadmaps of U.S. capability development and S&amp;T developmental strategic plans.

Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-	Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.
-	Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies.
-	Architecture development and evaluation to develop new U.S. capability.
-	Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.

Analytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A), computer based engineering models, and purposed designed equipment to demonstrate or confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-	Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.
-	Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.
-	Integrated MS&amp;A leveraging Service- and Agency–level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.
-	Red Teaming existing and planned U.S. capabilities and weapons systems using emerging threat systems and capabilities in emerging scenarios.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Strategic studies parametrically define the emerging threat space, determine feasibility of potential solutions and parametrically analyze the solution trade space. Specific tasks that will be executed within the strategic studies area include:
-	Explore the feasibility and trade space options for Joint, fully networked command control and communications capabilities across domains.
-	Identify the early applications for artificial intelligence and autonomous systems to address national defense challenges.  
-	Explore the feasibility and trade space options for countering adversary’s emerging  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. 
-	Explore feasibility and potential early applications of directed energy for offensive and defense capabilities.
-	Analyze the trade space of Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities in the context of operational impact, resiliency, affordability, and time to orbit.

Analytic tool development
-	Develop analytic tools to inform and evaluate new technologies’ potential to counter emerging threats and exploit adversary vulnerabilities from air, land, sea, and space domains.
-	Develop analytic tools to provide inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.
-	Develop integrated modeling, simulation, and analysis tools to aid complex acquisition decisions.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) conducts analysis to identify and accelerate the development, demonstration, and transition of potentially game-changing capabilities to shape and counter emerging threats and improve U.S. security posture.  This funding line was established in FY 2018 from transferred funds from PE 0603289D8Z / Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts, to be used for MHA related endeavors.  In a partnership endeavor across the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies, SCO combines capability innovation with new concepts for warfighting that leverage new technology areas, including autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  SCO conducts projects on accelerated timelines, in all warfighting domains, at any classification or access level.

The Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts -MHA Program Element supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming. Projects focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems, and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2017, Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was transferred from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS)  (PE 0603342D8W).  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY 2020, DIU funding transferred from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z consistent with the realignment and establishment of USD(Research &amp; Engineering), and disestablishment of USD(Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics).  In FY 2018 and FY 2019, this program had $23.498 million and $29.198 million, respectively, in PE 0603342D8W.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  The DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016. 

DIU mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and DoD in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority.  Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 OMB/OSTP research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.  The DIU program will find and provide access to leading-edge technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.   Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) when it was established in July 2015. In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the operational control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) with functional realignment of the resources across the FYDP to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) beginning in FY 2018. In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)). In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). Effective FY 2020, DIU will transfer from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z with a functional realignment of resources across the FYDP to OUSD(R&amp;E).  In FY 2018 and FY 2019, this program had $23.498 million and $29.198 million, respectively, in PE 0603342D8W. The FY 2020 increase of $0.200 thousand will result in a minor re-balance of investments across the technology focus areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Autonomy, Human Systems, Cyber, Space, Advanced Technology Material and Manufacturing, and Power and Energy.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

With outposts in Mountain View, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas, DIU serves as a bridge between those in the U.S. Military executing our nation's highest priority problems with companies developing cutting technology for the commercial sector.  DIU continuously experiments on methods to identify, contract, prototype, and transition novel technology with commercial entities that would not otherwise do work with the DoD.  The end goal is to accelerate the adoption of cutting-edge technology and grow the defense industry base for the warfighter.</r2:Description>

The Secretary of Defense's strategic priorities includes improving the Departments lethality through multiple means to include the openness and willingness to evolve by adopting new ideas to ensure a better future for the Department and the Nation.  One of the tenets of this priority is to expand the Department's ability to access leading edge technological innovations through commercial partnerships.  The funding DIUx executes is critical as it incentivizes non-traditional defense sector companies to work with and invest in advancing DoD future capabilities.  

 Some of the projects undertaken include:  
- Hardened Network Defense that provides warfighters improved network security by obscuring vital services and data, thereby significantly decreasing the ability of advancing cyber threats to map, attack or exploit tactical systems.
- Command, Control, and Situational Awareness web-based software platform that supports user's ability to visualize relevant activities and operational metrics, collaboratively plan and approve defense activities, and monitor/manage subsequent.  DIUx projects signal investment targets for venture capital opportunities.  While these are small when compared to the DoD total budget, the 3rd party investment multiplier they generate are without equal.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department. In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that will be a source of battlefield advantage, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation.

Leveraging innovative technologies from commercial startup companies has the potential to rapidly address warfighter problem sets in areas where commercial innovation outstrips government investment in the same technology areas. Through a unique partnership with other government agencies, we gain access to In-Q-Tel's vetting of innovative technologies from commercial startup companies where much of the research and development (R&amp;D) funds are provided by the venture capital community. Small DoD investments in these companies, often in partnership with other U.S. Government agencies, further leveraging their dollars spent, provides short work programs to adapt the commercial technologies for warfighter applications. The deliverables from the work program allow the warfighters to rapidly pilot technology and concepts, with the ability to fail early and cheaply, and provide the avenue to refine warfighter requirements and transition technology from successful pilots to traditional DoD activities for integration into broader R&amp;D efforts or acquisition programs of record.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program focuses on three main areas: 1) Rapid innovation and experimentation in commercial start-up technology via In-Q-Tel to address priority warfighter problem sets, 2) Project Datahub to pilot innovative AI/ML automation for data fusion of commercial and government data to address a high-priority Combatant Command challenge; and 3) Expansion of Project Datahub to address high priority areas.

Rapid Innovation and experimentation with commercial startup technology: Through the unique partnership with the Intelligence Community (IC) in place for this effort, a wide variety of emerging commercial technologies are rapidly assessed for applicability to a wide spectrum of priority DoD problem sets. Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these evolving technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, sharing costs with IC partners, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing other DoD R&amp;D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots as well as on traditional R&amp;D in technologies not well served by commercial start-up companies.

Project Datahub: This effort focuses on maturing and demonstrating the automated processing of space-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), Artificial Intelligence-driven Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), and Fix-Find-Finish-Exploit-Assess (F3EA) into an integrated capability to aid Combatant Commander and Component forces by providing more robust long-lead Indications and Warnings (I&amp;W) against high priority threats. The approach is composed of three innovative building blocks: 1) Machine learning techniques applied to commercial data sources and algorithms together with high-side government data sources for automated country-wide anomaly and change detection – a crucial element for enhancing indications and warnings required for deliberate action; 2) Machine-Human collaboration architecture to accelerate the F3EA joint forces targeting and decision-making cycle; and 3) Autonomous weaponeering demonstration for timely precision strikes to hold mobile missile systems at risk.  Project Datahub is being implemented in the IC’s secure cloud environment (C2S).

Expansion of Project Datahub. Following a successful demonstration of Project Datahub in 2017, the team was directed to expand Project Datahub to address high priority areas. Some of these problem sets may leverage similar technologies to the pilot program, with data coverage for different parts of the world and algorithms tuned for different targets of interest, while other problem sets may require completely different data, algorithms, and/or technologies. Funding in FY 2020 will allow the team to expand its efforts into additional high priority areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The United States has enjoyed a historical technological advantage in sensors, weapons, and countermeasures.  To offset this advantage, adversaries are developing competing and asymmetric capabilities that are enabled by advanced commercial electronic components and devices.  These threats range from terrorist-employed improvised devices, small unmanned air systems, and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems such as advanced sensors and communications systems, advanced Electronic Warfare (EW) components and systems, integrated air defense systems (IADS), and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles. 

The rate at which new threats are appearing continues to accelerate and demands a faster response than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development, and acquisition processes can provide.  The myriad of new advanced electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats have made operations in the EMS significantly more difficult and complex.  The challenges posed by new kinetic and nonkinetic EMS threats and the dire consequences of technology surprise highlight the need to rapidly develop and field innovative EW and EW-Cyber capabilities that can address new threats far more quickly and in more cost-effective ways.

The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) program is specifically designed to address these challenges through efforts designed to substantially accelerate new nonkinetic solutions for the EMS battlespace.  To do this, the JEAT program explores technologies and approaches that either fall outside the Services’ research and development (R&amp;D) programs of record or are being developed at rates that cannot deliver needed capabilities in the required timeframes. 

To identify nearer-term and lower-cost solutions, JEAT specifically explores and assesses approaches that use off-the-shelf military and commercial technologies in innovative ways.  This approach has resulted in substantial savings for the Services and the Department in both R&amp;D and in Programs of Record.  It has also enabled needed military capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible by traditional DoD approaches. 

JEAT program efforts are focused in four areas in two project codes, Project 619 and Project 245.

There currently are three classes of efforts within Project 619, EW and Non-Kinetic Effects Experimentation and Oversight:

(1) Experimentation/Demonstration efforts utilize innovative field and laboratory experimentation venues to fully understand current and future threats and more rapidly and thoroughly explore, mature, and demonstrate potential countermeasures and overmatch opportunities. This effort will be realigned and funded out of the 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element beginning in FY 2020. 

(2) Advanced Technology Development/Verification efforts investigate mature technologies and approaches to counter advanced threats in innovative ways and provide powerful new warfighting capabilities.  These efforts include advanced technology development of new sensors and countermeasures in laboratory environments and the development and demonstration of new warfighting capabilities such as computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies and approaches to enhance EMS situational awareness and accelerate nonkinetic operations planning and decision-making. This effort will be realigned to Project 245 beginning in FY 2020.

(3) EW Collaboration and Planning ensures appropriate coordination and technological oversight of Department and Service EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D programs and processes and provides governance insights for senior decision-makers. This effort will be realigned to Project 245 beginning in FY 2020.

Currently the sole effort in Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation explores computer-augmented data dominance and machine learning technologies, tools, and approaches to enhance EMS situational awareness and accelerate nonkinetic operations planning and decision-making.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 619, EW and Non-Kinetic Effects Experimentation and Oversight explores and assesses innovative technologies and approaches to rapidly mitigate advanced threats and demonstrate new overmatch technologies in ways not being explored by the Services.  Three efforts, Experimentation/Demonstration (Expt/Demo), Advanced Technology Development/Verification (ATD/V), and Electronic Warfare Enterprise Collaboration and Planning (EW C&amp;P), focus on enabling nearer-term lower-cost technology transitions to the warfighter with reduced risk. 

Expt/Demo efforts use innovative large-scale field experimentation venues to explore, demonstrate, mature, and assess innovative technologies and approaches to counter advanced electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) threats and provide new overmatch capabilities for U.S. forces.  ATD/V efforts mature, integrate, and demonstrate technologies and approaches not being explored by the Services, including the use of off-the-shelf commercial and military technologies.  They include laboratory efforts to demonstrate nearer-term, lower cost technological solutions to emergent threats.  EW C&amp;P efforts are conducted within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  These efforts assess, ensure coordination, and provide insights to senior leadership on all Departmental EW and EW-Cyber research and development (R&amp;D). 

Expt/Demo venues simultaneously explore myriads of technologies and approaches side-by-side with warfighter participation to more rapidly identify and mature promising technological solutions.  They employ very complex and dense EMS environments, fielded and in-development threats, and emerging technologies and capabilities in combinations and ways not otherwise achievable due to cost and other limitations.  These venues thus provide greater realism and far more information than any other developmental approach. 

The next Expt/Demo venue, Silent Hammer (SH), is a multi-year, multi-agency, live, virtual, and constructive series of events to explore, assess, mature, and accelerate technologies and approaches for multi-platform, multi-aperture, multi-domain (M3) passive/active sensing and targeting in complex and congested EMS environments.  Modeled after JEAT’s highly successful BLACK DART, TRIDENT SPECTRE, Rotorcraft Aircraft Survivability Equipment Experiment (RASE), and VIGILANT HAMMER venues, SH will use both scripted and dynamic scenarios to give participants opportunities to explore new M3 capabilities and approaches to engage emerging EMS threats.  Follow-on venues will address similar compelling capabilities, approaches, and threats. This effort will be realigned and funded out of the 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element beginning in FY 2020.

ATD/V explores, matures, integrates, and demonstrates emerging technologies and approaches to address compelling EW and EW-Cyber warfighting needs.  Many of these efforts are conducted in JEAT’s state-of-the-art Distributed Electronic Effects Development (DEED) Laboratory to enable exploration of exceptionally complex approaches and interactions including, for example, multi-aperture collaborative-coherent EW and EW-Cyber employment using exquisitely coordinated electronic sensing and attack capabilities. 

EW C&amp;P supports activities related to selecting, organizing, overseeing, and coordinating all EW and EW-Cyber-related R&amp;D efforts across DoD.  EW C&amp;P oversees and ensures coordination and collaboration between OSD and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Services, and the Intelligence Community (IC) on all EW and EW-Cyber activities within DoD.  To accomplish this, EW C&amp;P identifies, assesses, and develops recommendations to address EW- and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensors, seekers, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and EMS battle management.  EW C&amp;P also provides programmatic recommendations and decision support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) on Programs of Record, Joint Urgent Operational Need responses, and similar efforts, including technology maturity and availability, critical program information standards, foreign disclosure, and technical signals requirements.  EW C&amp;P also conducts and leads deep dives and analyses of technological opportunities and advanced threats to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D research, development and acquisition efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Project 619 continues interfacing with the Intelligence Community (IC) at senior levels to address critical intelligence gaps related to foreign EMS capabilities and advanced technology development efforts.  Project 619 also assessed alternative courses of action for employing advanced, adaptive, and cognitive EW technologies that are being developed and marketed commercially for data communications, radar, and other advanced spectrum domains previously dominated by DoD.  Emerging concepts and technologies from the R&amp;E Reliance Process and the EW Science and Technology Community of Interest road maps were assessed for their potential impact and value.  Analysis and coordination of national and international efforts addressing emerging Information Operations and EW-Cyber Convergence topics were addressed as well as efforts to advance technologies that provide countermeasures to imaging infrared seekers and expand U.S.-Australia collaboration in EW-Cyber.  These efforts guided planning of Non-Kinetic Battle Management and Visualization Technology research efforts in Project 245 of this Program Element.

In addition to continued participation in ongoing efforts mentioned above, FY 2018 efforts include the development of a variety of new EW capabilities including distributed cooperative or coherent aperture techniques; battle management and visualization technologies for optimization of non-kinetic fires; asymmetric targeting technologies; passive system countermeasure techniques; and national technical means applications to EW.  Efforts will also guide planning of future EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation (Project 245) research efforts.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the DoD modernization priorities, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program conducts prototype demonstrations and experimentation to address Joint and Combatant Commands’ (CCMDs) warfighting needs within two to four years of the identification of a need.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes to the field for military utility assessment (MUA) enabling scale-up of science and technology from the laboratories into defense acquisition programs.  The objective is to affordably operationalize prototyped technologies that enable warfighters to explore novel concepts and to facilitate informed transition to formal programs of record (PoR).  Based on the results of the MUA, performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are “left behind” for additional assessments or operational use, transitioned to a PoR, or returned to the technical baseline inventory for further development.  The JCTD program serves as a transition bridge between the USD (R&amp;E) and the USD Acquisition and Sustainment offices. 

The key tenets of the program fulfill national objectives to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and enable the Department of Defense (DoD) to achieve greater performance and affordability.  Following USD(R&amp;E) guidance, the JCTD program seeks to inform new mission capabilities for the Joint Warfighter with a focus on expediting transition timelines to meet critical challenges and operational problems.  Investment for FY 2019 and beyond enables independent demonstrations and operational assessments for emerging cross-cutting technologies, including detection and tracking of hypersonic threats; hardening technology that protects systems against directed energy threats; machine learning tools that increase data processing, exploitation, and data sharing for intelligence analysts; demonstration of improved sensors for persistent wide-area surveillance in a global positioning system-denied environment; and demonstration of improved precision guided munitions that enhances missile defense and restricts enemy movements in the multi-domain environment.  JCTD outcomes accelerate technology transition by rapidly evaluating technology risk, reliability, interoperability, cyber security, and manufacturing processes.  Evaluating prototyped technologies in a relevant operational environment informs acquisition pathways and major acquisition program decisions prior to milestone A or B approvals.

The JCTD program achieves its objectives by engaging the Military Services, interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the DoD's access to prototyping and innovation.  JCTDs serve as a vehicle for CCMDs to address Joint Force strategic priority areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment.  JCTDs often address technology needs that fall into the seams between the Military Services and DoD Agencies.  JCTD investments are informed by the CCMDs’ integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessment provided by the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps.

In FY 2018, the JCTD program successfully completed three MUAs and transitioned three JCTD prototypes.  Two JCTDs transitioned all or select components to new or existing PoRs, and one operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in theater operations. 

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:
A successful JCTD will transition capability for operational use.  The historical transition rate for the JCTD program is 85 percent,  including: 64 prototypes (55 percent) transitioning to a PoR; 31 prototypes (26 percent) providing “leave-behind” assets for operational fielding; and five prototypes (four percent) placed on the General Services Administration schedule.  The remaining 17 prototypes (15 percent) were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations while rapidly accelerating game changing technologies/capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Focus areas within the current selection cycle include: joint lethality in contested environments; resilient command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and positioning, navigation, and timing; and, survivable and agile logistics.  The focus areas were derived from the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and the DoD modernization priorities.  Technology areas under consideration include:  detection and tracking of hypersonic threats; hardening technology that protects systems against directed energy threats; machine learning tools that increase data processing, exploitation, and data sharing for intelligence analysis; demonstration of improved sensors for persistent wide-area surveillance in a global positioning system-denied environment; and demonstration of improved precision guided munitions that enhances missile defense and restricts enemy movements in the multi-domain environment.

The final objective for the JCTD program is to maintain the United States' technological superiority across the range of military operations while reducing the cost of operations, facilitating joint interoperability, and allowing for the rapid insertion of new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  PIER supports the National Defense Strategy's focus on logistics modernization and the need for resilient and agile logistics.  PIER will deliver a dynamic, agile, cost effective (non-military construction) expeditionary engineering solution to rapidly repair damaged or degraded ports to a minimum level of serviceability after an attack or natural disaster.  Agility is achieved through a smaller footprint, commercial off-the-shelf components, and quick reaction of theater-based repair assets (e.g., pre-packaged, pre-positioned).  The intent of PIER is to assure continued logistics resiliency and freedom for U.S. Forces to maneuver and conduct agile strategic sealift and logistics.  PIER will allow the Department of Defense to address the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, facility, and policy (DOTMLPF+P) concerns about its ability to conduct rapid port damage repair.  FY 2018 efforts included an operational demonstration of the pile bracing/bridging and mooring technologies, and a technical demonstration on the Pier Overdecking System (PODS).  These technologies allowed secondary components to strengthen the superstructure of the piers.</r2:Description>

HALO directly supports the Department of Defense’s strategic efforts to develop resilient command, control, and communications at the tactical level.  HALO uses high altitude, low-cost balloons as communication relays in denied environments.  It accomplished this by using the ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency (RF) spectrum and techniques that provide an undisturbed and unrecognizable link to the source of the UHF signals.  The advanced technology resides at the user terminals on the ground, which receive data from the balloon-platforms, and perform functions that allow effective two-way communication in a contested RF environment.  In FY 2018, HALO completed laboratory testing and two operational flight-test demonstrations with several high-altitude relays against multiple jammers.  HALO received procurement funds to complete the concept of operations, conduct military utility assessment, and transition to the USMC program office for production acquisition contracts.

                                                    <r2:Description>Previously funded JCTD.  Under C-WOLF directly supports the National Defense Strategy's focus to develop resilient and federated communication and information systems from the tactical to the strategic level.  Under C-WOLF provides stealthy and low-latency optical laser communications (OCOMMS) between undersea systems and air platforms.  Using low probability of intercept/low probability of detection technology, the Under C-WOLF JCTD accomplished this by exploiting the air-water-interface (AWI) OCOMMS system and the all-through-water (ATW) OCOMMS system to operate at tactically useful bandwidths, depths, and ranges.  The bandwidth for the AWI OCOMMS system provides real-time command and control capability to the submarine.  The bandwidth for the ATW OCOMMS system allows an unmanned underwater vehicle to provide results of extensive surveys to a submarine.  Both systems together increase operational effectiveness of underwater communications in a radio frequency denied, degraded, or contested area, particularly in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command areas of responsibility.  In FY 2018, Under C-WOLF began maturing the AWI and ATW systems.  Commenced testing and laboratory demonstrations.</r2:Description>

The three programs are (1) CCMD direct liaison support, (2) JCTD pre-transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD direct liaison support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project identification, demonstration venues, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling them to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD pre-transition:  In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD demonstration phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD pre-transition funds may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office:  Executes a select number of highly classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The ET funds are used to assess or mature emerging capabilities that support the initiation of a developmental or operational prototype.  ET investments are small (average less than $0.500M), short (less than one year) efforts that may lead to a JCTD prototype, depending on the final assessment and determination of technical maturity.  Examples of ETs funding in FY 2018 include:  1) The Autonomous Mission Package Planning and Execution (AMPPE) ET, a risk reduction effort for a set of autonomy-focused JCTDs.  AMPPE demonstrated a baseline system with the ability to mission plan and conduct distributed cognitive networked electronic warfare and intel-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) missions using multiple unmanned aerial systems.  This set a foundation for the Brilliant Effects Employment Shadow (BEES), Low-Cost Cruise Missile (LCCM) and Resilient Autonomy JCTDs.  2) Scanning Infrared Sensor for Unmanned Air Vehicle Detection and Tracking (SISUDT), a prototype fixed-site, multi-sensor counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) to detect, track, and identify group one and two UASs near forward operating bases.  One SISUDT prototype was deployed in support of OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE for an in-theater validation of infrared UAS detection.  As a result, the U.S. Air Force funded the operation of two SISUDT prototypes in theater.  3) IMEA (acronym is classified): Matured and manufactured a new unmanned aerial system airframe to address significant Warfighting gaps (details are classified).  Began a risk reduction effort to ensure manufacturing standards and requirements are in place for the initial airframe prototype.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing program of record (PoR).  The existing PoR can acquire, further mature, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the capabilities development document (CDD) or capabilities production document (CPD)) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
- The Results of JCTD can be used to inform research and engineering, or validate a joint requirement per the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  This includes identification of the need through development of an initial capability description (ICD) document or accelerating the development of a CDD or CPD to establish a new PoR.
- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products are listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Strategic Goals Supported:
-  Mature and demonstrate a prototype that fills a joint capability gap. 
-  Demonstrate a capability to address a DoD key strategic gap. 
-  Demonstrate a prototype that informs the acquisition and requirements process. 
-  Conduct an independent technology risk assessment.
-  Successful military utility assessment.

MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:  
JCTDs demonstrate capability objectives within 24-48 months.  The JCTD program continues to assess transition.  In FY 2018, 100 percent of completed prototypes successfully transitioned and exceeded the DoD strategic performance goal of 40 percent.  Two of three completed prototypes transitioned all or select capabilities or components to a new or existing PoR.  One operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in theater operations.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Currently fielded satellite communications (SATCOM), terrestrial, and Tactical Data Links (TDLs) will be adversely affected during operations in contested Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2/AD) environments.  The primary threat is from sophisticated electronic warfare capable of advanced jamming and signal collection techniques that are rapidly evolving to become more capable and agile.  Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains, and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.

The DoD’s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a “leap ahead” of today’s capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to become more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.

The Future Autonomous Battlespace Radio Frequency with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) program is developing next generation communications layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture is flexible enough to support Commander’s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC’s efforts focus on developing the advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam (AJ), Low Probability of Intercept(LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) waveforms; adaptive processing algorithms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit/receive/nulling); adaptive power control; Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)/Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques; self-healing mechanisms and cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service.  The guiding tenets for creating this new Command, Control, Communications, Computers, &amp; Intelligence (C4I) capability encompass enabling new missions, i.e. providing resilient tactical data links, communications and networking “service level” capabilities, interoperation, cost (affordable), and improved performance in terms of military value.

Based on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC is verifying the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitates the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense-wide Manufacturing Science and Technology (DMS&amp;T) program is the joint, defense-wide component of the DoD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program directed in Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2521.

The DMS&amp;T program supports the National Defense Strategy (2018) which states a healthy defense industrial base is a critical element of U.S. power and the National Security Innovation Base.  The ability of the military to surge in response to an emergency depends on our Nation’s ability to produce needed parts and systems, healthy and secure supply chains, and a skilled U.S. workforce.  The objective of the DMS&amp;T program is to increase the speed of innovation and provide frequent technology off-ramp opportunities, turning inventions and scientific discoveries into actual equipment and capabilities for our men and women in uniform as quickly and affordably as possible.  The DMS&amp;T program has created and is sustaining an ecosystem that addresses near term critical technology requirements and accelerates promising technology (hypersonics, directed energy, artificial intelligence, etc.) to the warfighter via innovative manufacturing methods through a two-pronged strategy: (1) OSD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) R&amp;D projects and the (2) Manufacturing Innovation Institutes (MIIs).

This program also supports many of the recommendations in the Executive Order Report “Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States” September 2018.

There are two project codes in this Program Element (PE) : P680 OSD Manufacturing Technology and P350 the DoD Manufacturing USA Institutes.  

P680 OSD Manufacturing Technology:
The OSD Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program was established to address needs beyond the risk of a single Service or agency. It focuses on cross-cutting defense manufacturing needs and stimulates early development of manufacturing processes and enterprise business practices, concurrent with S&amp;T development, to achieve the largest cost-effective impact and facilitate development of enabling capabilities for the warfighters.

P350 DoD Manufacturing USA Innovation Institutes: 
This project is focused on supporting eight DoD led manufacturing innovation institutes which are part of the Manufacturing USA network of manufacturing innovation institutes.  The technologies that are being pursued include (1) additive manufacturing; (2) digital manufacturing, design and manufacturing cybersecurity; (3) lightweight metals; (4) integrated photonics; (5) flexible hybrid microcircuits; (6) smart fibers and textiles; (7) advanced tissue biofabrication and; (8) advanced robots for manufacturing.  Each institute is a public/private partnership that matches DoD funding at a one to one ratio or greater and has established a consortium of members from industry and academia to mature the manufacturing processes in their respective areas, to build out the ecosystems that supports these areas, and provides resources supporting advanced manufacturing education and workforce development.  Through the government investment, DoD maintains strategic influence in the work accomplished by the institutes and realizes accelerated technological innovation for defense products.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

As a technology investment program, OSD ManTech serves its joint mission requirements by investing in enterprise wide issues with joint service applicability and seeks to enhance manufacturing capability for defense-essential/defense-unique technologies that are beyond reasonable/normal industry and program office risk.  In support of this mission the OSD ManTech program invests in broad technology initiatives that support multiple systems’ requirements as well as specific individual projects meeting more focused and immediate warfighter needs.

Key OSD ManTech technical areas include Advanced Electronics and Optics, Advanced Materials and Composites, Advanced and Emerging Manufacturing Processes, and Advanced Energetics Manufacturing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Efforts include:

1. “Boot Camps” are 4-day short courses that provide military organizations instruction on topics related to innovation and intrapreneurship (including human centered design, lean methodology, technology literacy, and psychology of innovation) and taught to apply these skills to a set of command-sponsored problem topics. 
2. “Startup Innovation Fellowship (SIF)” is a 6-week fellowship opportunity for service members and civilians to be embedded in private companies to learn best practices in critical areas applicable to DoD such as data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cyber security, logistics, rapid prototyping, etc. 
3. Collaboration Portfolio (CP): The CP programs connect communities of innovators around problems and technologies relevant to national security to enable formation of new ventures.
• Hacks exposes college students and local ventures to DoD customer problems over a 48 hour period and aims to provide Minimal Viable Product (MVP) or low-TRL solutions to the sponsor. 
• Hacking for Defense exposes college students to DoD customer problems over an academic semester and aims to provide MVP solutions through 1 of 3 channels: formation of a venture; direct solution adoption by the problem sponsor; or reframing the original problem.
• Source invites bottom-up, innovation from inside a military formation by providing either new solutions or novel applications directly to leadership from sponsoring command.
• Catalyst exposes local ventures to DoD customer problems over a 6-18month period and provides high-TRL solutions for immediate adoption by the problem sponsor or a DoD contracting entity (e.g., DIU).  
• Acceleration Portfolio (AP): The AP programs grow and mature civil-military technology ventures by ensuring that innovators can access critical resources, including design and engineering support, mentorship services, and commercial and DoD R&amp;D infrastructure to build, test, and enhance venture concepts.
• Maker provides facilities, access, materials, and training to entrepreneurs to fabricate, develop, and facilitate rapid prototyping of their technology.
• Fed Tech pairs cutting edge inventor teams and technologies from the United States federal government laboratory system with highly qualified entrepreneurs to conduct customer discovery and build business models.
• MD5 Starts is a format for showcasing early stage startups who are working on technologies and products that are pursuing a dual-use market strategy.
• Hatch helps entrepreneurs/teams with an idea (i.e., from H4D) learn how to form and build a venture using industry best practices. 
• Propel provides companies that have prototypes or initial customers with world-class education, mentorship, and relevant business connections to prepare the venture for scale while elevating their visibility in the venture community. 
• Gauge provides facilities, access, materials, and training to entrepreneurs to develop, iterate, and refine their technology up to TRL 6/7. Also provide access to test and development ranges.
• Launch identifies existing government technology that can be applied to a stated customer problem or problem set and to then work with a team on a path to commercialize the technology.
• Boost provides opportunities for companies to secure early, non-dilutive government funding in the form of grants or contracts working the SBIR program.
• Bridge provides founding teams with mentors and advisors who can help them in business, customer, and product development by providing the right advice and insights at the right time.</r2:Text>

Develop tools to assist small and medium size companies for manufacturing cybersecurity.
3. Mature innovative metal lightweighting technologies across all platforms and services that save fuel and increase combat payload. Investments would address both targeted application spaces and cross-cutting enabling technologies.  This includes activity in linear friction welding; design and manufacturing methods for promising high strength alloys; develop lightweight engineered structures; optimize ultra-fast heat treatment and quenching and extend the use of thin-walled casting technology to cast components for military vehicles.
4. Utilize the existing world-class 300mm integrated silicon photonics foundry in Albany, NY, the indium phosphide photonics foundry in Silicon Valley, and the world’s first photonic integrated circuit test, assembly, and packaging facility in Rochester, NY to accelerate low cost, volume manufacturing of devices for LIDAR, 5G telecom, and quantum dot lasers and the integration of advanced assembly and packaging techniques for optical elements. 
5. Mature flexible hybrid technology to support a supply chain that can produce electronics on flexible, stretchable, and 3-dimensional structures. This will create new innovative products that can be used for warfighter wearable health sensors, portable x-ray imagers, precision navigation timing packages and phased array antennas for electronic warfare and radar systems.
6. Mature the manufacturing processes that will enable industry to produce and use smart fibers and textiles and incorporated them into innovative products using conventional weaving and knitting equipment. Advanced fabric technology offers unique solutions to critical national security challenges, including soldier communication systems; functional composite materials for ground and air vehicles; and distinctive undersea and space capabilities.  Through the recently created Defense Fabric Discovery Center continue to develop a fabric-based solutions in Free Space Optical Communications (Identification Friend/Foe (IFF)) that eliminates issues of detection and jamming and is affordable and easily deployable.
7. Mature the technology for large scale, cost-effective, reproducible manufacturing of high-quality tissues that can be used to treat severely wounded warfighters, which contributes to force readiness and saves lives on the battlefield.  This includes (1) cell selection, culture and scale-up, (2) biomaterial selection and scale-up, (3) tissue process automation and monitoring, (4) tissue maturing technologies, and (5) tissue preservation and transport.
8. Accelerate research, development, and implementation of collaborative robotic technologies for use in manufacturing. Early use include smart companion robots for vehicle assembly, perception-aided collaborative robotic wire harness assembly, robot assistance for composites manufacturing, and robotic sanding and finishing. The focus is on (1) Versatility — robots that can perform a variety of tasks; (2) Flexibility — robots that can be deployed and re-deployed rapidly and easily; (3) Lower cost — reducing the overall cost of robot systems; and (4) Collaboration — robots that safely work alongside and with people.

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Each Manufacturing USA institute is established through a competitive selection process. The executing military department or agency, in close and continuous coordination with OSD ManTech, publishes a formal solicitation (funding opportunity announcement) for proposals describing the scope of required activities and extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations (including universities) are eligible to bid, and each bidder forms a broad consortium of industry and academic partners. The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium. The final terms of the cooperative agreement/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed. Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Assessing the performance of the DoD-led manufacturing institutes, part of the whole-of-government Manufacturing USA Program, requires a multi-faceted view of ‘performance,’ given the program’s layered base of DoD, government-wide, and national level public-private stakeholders and interests. Notwithstanding this complexity, the Department is careful to maintain orientation with the DoD ManTech program’s statutory goals and objectives and has concluded that those requirements are highly complementary to, and supportive of, the broader national goals of the Manufacturing USA Program as laid out in the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act of 2014. Performance relative to both sets of goals/objectives is necessarily measured in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and many of the institutes accomplishments previously addressed represent rich and highly descriptive qualitative and quantitative measure of program performance. The Department actively reviews or oversees the review of institute metrics at four levels: 1) the overall Manufacturing USA network level (this is done in coordination with the DoD’s Manufacturing USA interagency partners), 2) at the DoD/funding agency level (per the statutory requirements of DoD ManTech Program), 3) at the individual institute level (in coordination with each institute), and 4) at the specific technology project level (via DoD technical expert involvement in the institutes). Broadly, the institutes themselves are charged by the DoD, the Administration and Congress with ensuring that key elements of their innovation ecosystems will be matured and made widely available by fostering collaborations between appropriate elements of that ecosystem. 

The following four categories of metrics have emerged as common focus areas:
1.  Impact on U.S. Innovation Ecosystem
2.  Financial Leverage/Sustainability
3.  Education and Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development
4.  Technical Advancement
Specific metrics and the annual cycle for measuring progress against benchmarks are developed for each institute consortium and reflect that institute’s unique technology capability, expertise, and organizational structure. The Department strives to ensure that the assessment process captures and articulates the benefits to national security based upon technological advancements and the industrial base.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) will be augmented in FY 2020 to increase the Program’s ability to conduct risk-reducing joint prototyping; joint red teaming for validation of emerging technologies; and, joint experimentation, demonstration, and concepts of operation (CONOPs) development.  In FY 2020 all funding and appropriate project investment areas from the Quick Reaction Fund (project-code 826 within Program Element (PE) 0603826D8Z) will be incorporated into ECTD.  Additionally, in FY 2020, funding and activities for the Silent Hammer project will be incorporated into the ECTD program.  

ECTD funding enables project selection in the year of execution and provides leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD (R&amp;E)) with the flexibility and agility to anticipate and quickly respond to emergent DoD issues, time-sensitive threats, and innovation opportunities.  The program collaborates with and leverages government labs, academia, and industry to execute its mission in support of the National Defense Strategy, Joint Staff, and DoD modernization priorities.  Completed ECTD projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element supports the USD(R&amp;E) with experimentation and mid-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains and enhances warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  ECTD funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for CONOPs development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  Joint demonstrations and ECTD-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  The demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on small and non-traditional businesses; Silent Hammer, an advanced electronic warfare venue that transfers to ECTD in FY 2020; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  The red teaming funding line explores vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and enables USD(R&amp;E), and the broader defense science and technology community, to make informed decisions before investing in new capabilities.  Red teaming enables adaptation to unforeseen vulnerabilities or opportunities early in capability development when design changes are cost effective and programs can be re-directed if developmental dead ends are discovered.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, experimentations, and red teaming validations enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement.

ECTD prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for emerging capabilities.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Although projects are selected in the year of execution, anticipated FY 2020 technology areas include employment of directed energy from aircraft; multi-domain, autonomous learning systems; enabling technologies for missile defense; and, increased soldier lethality systems.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and DoD modernization priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The program provides feedback from engineers, scientists, operators, and technical threat emulation experts early in the development of a technology to enable rapid innovation or shifts in technology investments.  In FY 2018, TSOA partnered with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to execute a network-security and chemical/biological detection red team assessment.  Using FY 2018 funds, work continues in FY 2019 to conduct red teaming on remote advise and assist technologies, augmented reality systems, and force protection in large urban areas.  TSOA informs industry on Department of Defense potential vulnerabilities and identifies the tactics, techniques, and procedures that lead to the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities.  TSOA also identifies possible mitigation pathways and shares these discoveries with the DoD RDT&amp;E community, acquisition community, and Combatant Commands.

Leveraging the Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (PE 0603618D8Z) program's history of conducting highly successful experimentation venues, SH is a multi-year, multi-agency, series of field experimentation activities.  SH explores and demonstrates new electronic warfare (EW) technologies and approaches through the use of large-scale, dynamic field experiments.  SH focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art for detecting, classifying, and geo-locating electromagnetic signals of interest through novel technologies such as multi-platform, multi-aperture, multi-domain (M3) passive/active sensing in complex and congested electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environments.  SH includes both scripted and dynamic scenarios to experiment with the efficacy of both existing and new capabilities and approaches to engage emerging EMS threats.  The EW Community of Interest, Executive Committees, and warfighters are involved in the selection of follow-on experimentation topics, technology demonstrations, and scoping of these efforts to ensure their maximum relevance and value.</r2:Description>

Building on FY 2017 accomplishments, QDRG prototyped and demonstrated a next-generation low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), navigation-grade gyroscope for position, navigation, and timing applications.  This micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology enables precision targeting, navigation, and tracking with reduced error in Global Positioning System denied environments.  The reduced SWaP-C enables the technology to be incorporated into hand-held and small autonomous systems across the Services.  FY 2018 efforts focused on etching optimized quartz disks, design and fabrication of control electronics, and vacuum packaging for laboratory test and validation.  Transition partner funding supports package design modifications to enable a final prototype that can be leveraged as a north-finding system or integrated with MEMS accelerometers into an internal navigation system.  In FY 2019 QDRG prototype components will transition to the Joint Effects Targeting System, the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder, and the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System programs of record.</r2:Description>

The SPECTRE project completed an FY 2017 initiated effort to develop and demonstrate a greatly reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP) HSI capability that is compatible with multiple manned and unmanned platforms across the DoD.  The SPECTRE prototype provided the ability to perform stand-off detection of materials or targets of interest, enabling rapid target identification and shortening the kill-chain.  In FY 2018, SPECTRE developed a first-in-its-class, dual-field-of-view telescope with the ability to change optical path and field-of-view to adjust for off-nadir imaging.  The project also designed a robust pointing and stabilization optical path within a customized pod to enable integration with unmanned platforms.  In FY 2019 the project will complete pod construction, integration, and lab testing, leading to a SPECTRE flight test with remaining FY 2018 funds.  Leveraging partner funding in FY 2019, SPECTRE will transition to a deployed unmanned aerial system.

                                                    <r2:Description>R3D directly supports the National Defense Strategy’s priority for increased lethality through advanced simulations, synthetic training environments, and by providing superior knowledge of the battlespace during mission preparation and execution.  The R3D prototype will provide critical battlespace awareness to the warfighter, enabling rapid and accurate decision making at the tactical edge by closing the gap in terrain data for detailed tactical planning.  Incorporating machine learning enabled algorithms for geospatial intelligence processing and exploitation, R3D will create a national repository of open standard, globally correlated, 3D terrain data for operations, intelligence, and training.  This repository will enable interoperability required for short notice, joint mission rehearsal in addition to a creating a common domain for rapid experimentation with future operational concepts.  In FY 2018, R3D replicated 3D terrain data across the DoD enterprise and tested compatibility of 3D data with applications supporting tactical mission planning and execution for USSOCOM and U.S. Army missions.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>These complementary, agile, and flexible experimentation and demonstration capabilities and venues support the National Defense Strategy’s priority to increase the rate of innovation and enable Service, Combatant Command, and Agency user evaluation of emerging novel technologies in relevant environments.  Demonstration venues include the Thunderstorm venue for small and non-traditional businesses; the Stiletto maritime technology platform; and, other tailored multi-domain venues and ad-hoc demonstrations.  These experimentation and demonstration venues support the rapid discovery and transition of emerging technologies across the range of military operations.  The venues provide the DoD and interagency partners with an opportunity to identify and evaluate new and emerging technologies both from commercial and government sectors through a series of technology demonstrations, experiments, vignettes, and related activities.  The venues also offer a streamlined experimentation and demonstration process that encourages system developers to engage directly with the warfighter.  These engagements enable rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies to meet operational needs through the exploration of military utility, and identification of potential risks of emerging technologies. 

In FY 2018, Thunderstorm, Stiletto, and other venues conducted 20 demonstration and experimentation events which featured 124 innovative technologies from focus areas including dense urban and subterranean warfare; enhanced lethality for small unit operations; tactical ISR; and, resilience for collaborative systems of networked sensors.  Seventeen of these technologies transitioned directly to DoD operational users or were leveraged by formal programs of record, including an autonomous maritime landing system for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs); a long-range geolocation capability; and, a long-range vertical takeoff and landing fixed-wing UAV.  In FY 2018, these demonstration and experimentation venues also provided 75 small businesses and non-traditional innovators with the warfighter feedback critical to rapidly mature their technologies into viable prototypes.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>This project executed risk-reduction activities that informed the development and planned FY 2022 airborne demonstration of the USSOCOM Airborne High Energy Laser tactical prototype.  Funded risk reduction activities included modernization of existing laser control equipment, development of diagnostic assemblies, design and fabrication of an isolation structure, measuring laser performance while in a simulated aircraft environment, aircraft optical window mount and fairing development, and modifications to existing AC-130 Battle Management System (BMS) to support laser operations.  These activities informed the Airborne HEL tactical prototype design and enable early identification of required engineering design changes for major HEL subsystems.  Using FY 2018 funds, work continues in FY 2019 including optical window mounting, laser diagnostics, BMS modifications, and development of aircraft isolation systems.  After successful ground risk reduction testing, the risk reduction effort will transition in FY 2019 to USSOCOM to continue prototype development and airborne testing.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Red Teaming project assesses the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and newly developed systems.  Red teaming helps identify unanticipated disruptive opportunities and technological dead ends.  The project supports red teaming demonstrations to stress and assess emerging systems in key areas for gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life-cycle.  This project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  Red teaming informs requirements and helps accelerate acquisition pathways for joint missions.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Red Teaming for Technology Surprise supports early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Prototype Development for Demonstrations and Red Teaming supports targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red Teaming to Support Innovation in Concepts of Operations including comprehensive red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, the Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform technology acquisition and new concepts of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This project funds red teaming efforts to explore new capabilities in a competitive environment.  Efforts include 1.) Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2.) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstration, experiments, and concepts of operations earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3.) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current Department of Defense and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterization of future prototypes, requirement definition, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new concepts of operations.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) describes the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative. This program was originally established in the 1990s in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code §2249d). The ADL Initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver their training and education more efficiently and cost effectively—anytime, anywhere. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. Ultimately, this work supports DoD’s training and education mission, increases personnel readiness, saves resources, ensures the right people receive the right training and education, at the right time, and at the right cost, and facilitates interorganizational interoperability. Organizationally, this PE reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)). 

This PE provides policy oversight and guidance for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser–based simulations) and supports associated innovation, modernization, and coordination across DoD, Coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This work focuses on distributed learning interoperability (i.e., ensuring interagency technical and organizational systems function together), supports interagency/interorganizational coordination for its implementation, and helps agencies acquire new distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiency. 

This PE’s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The “modernization” work involves Advanced Technology Development (6.3) in technical areas such as e-learning, mobile learning, learner modeling and analytics, and software interoperability. These efforts inform the PE’s “documentation” work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents, such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (“Distributed Learning”) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, the documentation work drives “coordination” efforts, which consist of implementation support and interagency/interorganizational coordination. 

This PE’s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group of military personnel and DoD/federal civilians (at the O-6 and GS-15 level) who represent their agencies’ distributed learning equities and are key stakeholders in shaping the direction of these agencies (refer to DoDI 1322.26). These requirements are also aligned to DoD/federal strategic direction, such as the Army Learning Concept for Training and Education for 2020–2040 (TP 525-8-2), Navy’s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan, and they are considered against emerging industry trends and technologies. 

This PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and Coalition Partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and Coalition stakeholders acquire and implement emerging distributed learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports the components’ training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This PE serves as the innovation hub for distributed learning across the DoD and other government agencies, enabling innovation, finding efficiencies, informing stakeholders’ modernization efforts, and fostering interoperability across defense, government, and industry. ADL Initiative supports DoD-wide initiatives for innovation, modernization, and advancement of DoD enterprise-level online and mobile electronic training capability and learning tools. Activities include advanced technology design and development, demonstrations, assessments, and associated policy stewardship. Results improve efficiencies and reduce costs by reducing time spent in face-to-face instruction, allowing more time for practical application and repetition; increasing interoperability, which enables discovery, retrieval, and reuse of distributed learning content; and researching and prototyping methods of distributed learning with superior motivational and learning outcomes.</r2:Description>

                                                            <r2:Text>Total Learning Architecture – All of the U.S. Services, Joint Staff, and many other federal programs have released publications calling for a modern “learning ecosystem” comprised of interconnected learning opportunities, supported by technology, driven by data, and integrated with other talent management capabilities. This program is supporting its development by investigating the specifications and web-based digital services needed to make training and education technologies interoperable. In FY17, an early “Total Learning Architecture” prototype was tested with 75 Special Operators at Ft. Bragg. In FY18, this project will enter its second phase of development and will include additional empirical testing. 

Learning Data – In FY17, this program led a revision to DoD Instruction 1322.26, after extensive coordination with the Services and Joint Staff. The revised Instruction recommends the use of the Experience Application Programming Interface (xAPI), a technical specification that enables data exchange across training and education technologies. In FY18, this program will continue to refine the xAPI specification for semantic interoperability and will coordinate with stakeholders to deliver the implementation guidance, conformance testing tools, learning analytics, and data visualization capabilities they need to make most use of it. In FY18, this work is also expected to inform updates to DoD Instruction 1322.26’s fungible technical references.

Competencies and Credentialing – In FY17, this program investigated competency and credentialing management technologies, and it prototyped a web-based competency framework tool as part of the Total Learning Architecture demonstration. In FY18, this PE will continue its coordination efforts across defense and federal agencies for competency-based learning, and it will continue working with professional specifications and standards bodies in development of associated interoperability specifications to aid permeability across organizational boundaries. 

Personal Assistant for Learning – Adaptive learning tools promise to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of training and education, and these tools are critical parts of DoD’s modern “learning ecosystem” vision. This program examines the science and technology needed to design such capabilities, using open-architecture and open-source methods. In FY17, this PE successfully tested several frameworks, including a smartphone-based system with Defense Language students and a table-based e-book capability with Special Operators. In FY18, this program plans to work with other agencies to transition some of these capabilities into operational use, coordinate with professional specifications and standards bodies to author relevant technical guidelines, and to continue development of these emerging capabilities. 

Interagency and Interorganizational Coordination – In FY17, this program provided distributed learning modernization support to more than 40 defense agencies (e.g., The Army Distributed Learning Program, Naval Education and Training Command, Air Education and Training Command, Marine Corps Training and Education Command, Joint Knowledge Online, Defense Acquisition University), more than 15 international partners (e.g., NATO, The Technical Cooperation Program, Partnership for Peace Consortium), and other federal agencies (e.g., National Park Service, Customs and Border Protection). In FY18, this program will continue to coordinate with these stakeholders and with relevant working groups, such as the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>The primary objectives of this PE are to inform distributed learning modernization efforts, to develop associated policy and guidance documents, and to coordinate across distributed learning agencies to create technical alignment of distributed learning systems and find efficiencies for the government. 

MODERNIZATION: The modernization work consists of a collection of smaller technical efforts, each with project metrics that reflect their unique technical goals. Typical metrics include the advancement of related Technology Readiness Levels, the degree to which project investments are leveraged by other defense and federal agencies, the increase in the number of interoperable training and education digital systems, the impact of these efforts on defense/federal strategic planning, and downstream reductions in training and education portfolio costs. 

DOCUMENTATION: For the policy and documentation efforts, metrics include at-least annual update of published guidance, ensuring the documentation adheres to current technical/industry standards. The policy and documentation utility are also judged based upon its use, including both number of vendors adopting the policy and number of defense/federal acquisition efforts adhering to the guidance.

COORDINATION: For the interagency and interorganizational coordination efforts, performance is first measured based upon the number of agencies, international organizations, and professional groups directly supported. Success is measured based upon the number of requirements consolidated across defense and federal stakeholders, an increase in partnering between agencies for distributed learning resource sharing, and, ultimately, in improved return on investment for distributed learning efforts.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large- scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net- based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the February 2018 Defense Science Board Report, “Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems,” software is a crucial and growing part of weapons systems and the national security mission, and the DoD must address its ability to build and  sustain software continuously and indefinitely.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to ensure a competitive advantage.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.

The SEI Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This research seeks to mature and rapidly prototype techniques to verify methods for identifying requirements, systems of systems architectures, and virtual integration of components.  Furthermore, research in this area will pursue rapid prototyping and transitioning of capabilities that verify requirements for software assurance, analysis/control of unverified code and automated repair of damaged code.  Software production and code analysis methods developed through this program will also improve the ability to predict how complex software systems will behave in untested environments.  Increasingly, large numbers of lines of code will require a commensurate increase in sophisticated verification and validation mechanisms.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element (PE) will be adjusted to support the priorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  In FY 2020, this realignment includes a transfer of funding and appropriate project investment areas from the Quick Reaction Fund to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.  The remaining QRSP funding is focused on prototyping projects that are executed faster and explore higher risk concepts with the potential for immediate impacts to the Combatant Commanders and joint warfighters.  Additionally, in FY 2020 the Joint Raid Acquisition Cell Support will be transferred to PE 0903399D8Z within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for alignment and execution.  

Funding in the QRSP PE enables leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) to anticipate and quickly respond to emergent Combatant Command (CCMD) issues and time-sensitive threats by selecting projects within the year of execution and incubating them to rapidly develop potentially game-changing capabilities.  QRSP harnesses the national industrial bases by partnering with military Services, interagency partners, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), academia, and traditional or non-traditional industry.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element funds the development of risk-reducing prototypes and accelerates capability innovation to deliver performance to the joint warfighter at the speed of relevance.  QRSP prototypes increase warfighter lethality, affordably counter emerging technological threats, and help address the immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, DoD’s modernization priorities, and the Combatant Commands’ (CCMD) Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).

The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA).  Efforts within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, address challenges identified in the National Defense Strategy, and support the DoD’s modernization priorities. 

The QRF develops prototypes in response to emergent needs that take advantage of breakthroughs in rapidly evolving technologies and accelerate these innovations to the warfighter.  The QRF program initiates prototyping projects during the execution year to mature technologies critically needed for the CCMDs and rapidly transition those capabilities.  QRF projects are identified through current warfighter gaps, solutions proposed by CCMDs, and jointly applicable capabilities identified by the Services and Defense Agencies.  In 2020, QRF funding to support prototyping or experimentation will be transferred to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.  
 
The RRF develops prototypes to counter emerging threats; anticipate adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies; and, expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives accelerate innovation by rapidly developing high-risk prototypes with the potential for immediate and impactful transition of warfighter capabilities.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as machine learning algorithms and software intelligence, to enable novel prototypes with agile technology insertion paths.  Funded projects also leverage existing capabilities from traditional industrial bases and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      

The JRAC responds, in timeframes acceptable to the CCMDs, to Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) and Joint Emerging Operational Needs (JEON) that are submitted by CCMDs and validated by the Joint Staff.  To meet these objectives, JRAC leverages contingency and other rapid acquisition authorities.  In 2020, the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell Support will transfer to PE 0903399D8Z.  

The SMA supports senior leadership within the CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  Priorities for SMA programs are set by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO).  SMA products are typically generated within six to nine months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The FY 2019 Congressional decrement was for efficiencies and prior year carryover.   

The 2020 baseline reduction is the net of the transfer out of the Quick Reaction fund to Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (Program Element 0603699D8Z) to support Prototyping, and the transfer out of the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell to an Operations and Maintenance Program Element (0903399D8Z) within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) for proper alignment and execution.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) provides the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services and joint warfighters opportunities to capitalize on relatively mature technologies to rapidly prototype and field-test promising new prototypes that can have immediate impact on time-sensitive operational needs.  New capabilities address National Defense Strategy priorities and inform programs of record or new acquisition pathways to more effectively and affordably push innovation to the field.  QRF focuses on projects that have the potential to address conventional, disruptive, and asymmetric warfare needs.  QRF initiatives typically deliver a prototype application within 12 months of being funded.

In FY 2019, QRF identifies and funds prototypes that respond to critical operational needs and emerging threats.  QRF projects are selected in the year of execution based on Department, CCMD, Service, and other government organization identified threats and opportunities.  In FY 2020, QRF funds will transfer to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development to facilitate prototyping and experimentation to support the DoD’s modernization priorities.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Department of Defense has developed a trusted systems strategy including focusing efforts on mission assurance, comprehensive protection planning, industry standards, and advancing DoD's capability to identify and mitigate HW/SW vulnerabilities through science and technology.  These HW/SW Assurance projects directly support all elements in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act Section 937.  This program established the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) that federates hardware and software assurance expertise and capabilities throughout DoD and makes the capabilities directly available to programs.  

The JFAC provides tools, services, best practices, contract language, and other help to programs that detect, assess, prioritize, and mitigate mission critical vulnerabilities to malicious software attacks and supply chain exploitation vulnerabilities.  This collaboration helps mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in both SW and HW and yields secure architecture and design patterns available to all DoD programs.  In FY 2018, JFAC incorporated Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Defense Acquisition University products into the JFAC website and developed a software assurance (SwA) guidebook to aid implementation of SwA practices in DoD programs.  This project also supports Trusted and Assured Microelectronics Program Elements 0604294D8Z BA4 and 0605294D8Z BA5, which provide funding to demonstrate these capabilities and augment the hardware assurance capabilities of the JFAC.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) produces innovative prototypes with a high potential for disruptive improvement, and transitions them to joint warfighters and Combatant Commands (CCMDs).  RRF anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including current and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responds to new threats and opportunities.  Project selection is guided by department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy and the DoD’s modernization areas.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and deliver affordable capabilities faster than standard acquisition cycles.  These lower-cost prototypes and innovative business processes give the USD(R&amp;E) the agility to quickly explore new, higher-risk technology areas that have the potential for immediate, game-changing impacts.

In prior years, RRF supported the creation of novel sensing systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; produced advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.   

In FY 2019 and FY 2020, RRF will continue to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and provide a hedge against technology risk by identifying and delivering near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.  Focus areas for RRF include: disparate data fusion; autonomous systems and behaviors; urban characterization for enhanced lethality; prototypes for interconnected sensors and command networks; novel manufacturing to rapidly field prototypes; and, novel applications of repurposed commercial-off-the-shelf and government-off-the-shelf technologies. 

Recent success stories and significant transitions of note include:
• High Accuracy Video Object Classification (HAVOC): A prototype system that provided an automated, machine learning enabled, target recognition capability for expeditionary forces using a desktop computer.  HAVOC transitioned to an intelligence community partner in 2018, and HAVOC technologies have been incorporated into Project Maven.  
• Wide-area Infrared System for 360-Degree Persistent (WISP) surveillance: WISP prototyped and implemented a long-wave infrared hemispherical sensor for surveillance and tracking of moving objects.  This effort supports the counter-unmanned aerial systems mission by expanding the sensor’s field of view to 90 degrees elevation and refining the detection algorithms for the new targets.  WISP transitioned to the U.S. Air Force.  
• Future Infrared Search and Track (FIRST): FIRST created a novel method of building optical sensors capable of staring over a wide field of view with high resolution.  The advantages of this method include producing an image with more pixels than the focal plane array, decoupling the field of view from the aspect ratio of the focal plane, and extending the field of view beyond the optical design.  The FIRST prototype transitioned to the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of Naval Research for follow-on testing, development, and deployment.
• Social Network Aided Geolocation (SNAG): SNAG prototyped a suite of automated machine learning algorithms that accurately estimate geolocations for social media messages from location-indicative terms and metadata features.  This capability provides location estimates for the large volume of social media content that is not explicitly geotagged.  Geospatial analysis of social media has proven effective for identifying and tracking actors of interest as well as understanding local concerns and sentiments within an area of interest.  SNAG transitioned to the Defense Intelligence Agency’s GOSSIP architecture, which is widely used across the intelligence community.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>FY 2018 funds completed development of a previously funded prototype rapid DNA analysis system.  Current rapid DNA analysis systems rely on pneumatics and mechanical valves for microfluidic movement, resulting in bulky hardware and DNA analysis times greater than 60 minutes.  The FaSTR DNA instrument re-purposes commercial-off-the-shelf electronics and exploits centrifugally-driven microfluidics to conduct sample preparation, polymerase chain reaction, and assessment of the results.  This paradigm shift to microfluidic technology radically reduces the form factor, analysis time, and cost of the system.  The FaSTR project will produce the first truly portable, rapid DNA analysis instrument capable of generating DNA profiles from “sample in” to “answer out” in less than 30 minutes, while providing a match probability of 1 in 55 billion people.  In FY 2018, the project delivered three lightweight (&lt;10 lbs.) prototypes, and 75 consumables for operational testing in theater.  Test results, technical and training materials, and initial low rate production manufacturing technical specifications were delivered to the Army’s Program Manager Office Biometrics and will support U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) missions.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Prototyping Through Non-Traditional Pathways leverages technologies and emerging products developed by small, innovative businesses in the commercial sector including information technologies, internet-of-things sensors and adaptive networks, bio-medical advances, emerging quantum applications, and novel microelectronic/microelectromechanical system innovations.  Ideas from non-traditional emerging technology companies are matched against DoD, Combatant Command, Service, and other government priorities.  Promising solutions are selected for further test and evaluation and, if successful, rapid prototyping or fielding to transition commercial ideas with military utility.  These efforts support the Department's objectives of leveraging commercial innovation to maintain technology superiority, increasing rate of technology innovation, exploring alternative and faster pathways for acquisition, and fielding affordable and effective capabilities.  In FY 2018, Prototyping Through Non-Traditional Pathways conducted reviews focused on priorities of the multi-Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Communities of Interest, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, and the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization.</r2:Description>

Growth in social media, big data analytics, and large dynamic sensor networks requires new tools for aggregation, processing, exploitation, and dissemination.  Projects include the development of capabilities, software, and tools to fuse, analyze, and infer information from a wide variety of structured or unstructured datasets from a broad spectrum of sources.  Where possible these projects will exploit advanced machine learning systems and commercial technologies to provide solutions to emerging challenges in tracking targets, big data analytics, and extracting indications and warnings.  Technologies developed within this focus area will reduce cost and analyst requirements to provide meaningful intelligence in support of areas such as counter-missile/counter-weapons of mass destruction, gray-zone near-peer competition, human terrain mapping applications, and operations in denied areas.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) sensor networks are critical for providing asymmetric compensation against larger, near-peer adversaries.  Advances in distributed, interconnected sensors with fully networked command, control, and communications provide opportunities for new solutions to anti-access/area denial and persistent surveillance challenges.  Efforts in this focus area will increase the speed of innovation and technology adoption for dynamic, inhomogeneous, fully networked sensors and develop new tools to more effectively analyze or visualize ISR data.  Projects include improved sensor hardware; new capabilities enabled by networking sensor systems; sensor network protection and assured communications; validation of low-cost, robust persistent surveillance capabilities; and, establishment of more effective processing, exploitation, and dissemination capabilities.  Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) sponsored prototypes will facilitate integration of advanced ISR and communication capabilities into new and existing systems.  These prototypes will help increase the effectiveness of ISR architectures and reduce the human analyst requirement to produce actionable intelligence.</r2:Description>

With input from across the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector, SMA develops options to CCMD-generated challenging problems and informs the command's senior leadership.  Each SMA effort is initiated at the request of senior CCMD leadership.  Priorities for SMA problems are set by the Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO).  Products are typically produced within six to nine months and directly contribute to the decision making process of CCMD's senior leaders.  SMA is also supported by the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Challenges addressed with SMA efforts require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches that are not within the customer organization’s core competency.  SMA started a strategic analysis effort at the request of the United States Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  The effort evaluated strategic risks and identified knowledge gaps to provide an increased understanding of potential security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) subsequently asked SMA to apply the same methodology to identify emerging Russian threats and opportunities in Eurasia.  SMA efforts are facilitated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff/J-3 Operations and are executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Building on prior SMA efforts, U.S. Special Operations Command requested that SMA assess how the U.S. government can diagnose, identify, and assess indirect strategies, and develop response options against associated types of Gray Zone challenges.  SMA completed several actor and social media analyses including Virtual Think Tank Assessments (ViTTa) that provided summarized subject matter expert (SME) analyses to USSOCOM.  At the request of AFSPC, the FY 2017 and FY 2018 Gray Zone efforts focused on contested space operations.  Among other issues, this effort addressed the implications (rewards and risks) of the U.S. adopting a policy of space as a joint, combined, and inter-agency warfighting domain.  At the request of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC), FY 2018 funding also initiated an assessment of plausible political-military options regarding North Korea and near- and long-term implications of these for the U.S. and regional stakeholders.  These two follow-on Gray Zone efforts will apply the concepts and insights derived during the first phase to the realm of contested space operations in support of AFSPC, and implications of various U.S. actions towards North Korea.  Analysis will highlight the indications and warnings and the U.S. response options.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses Defense Research and Engineering priorities to advance engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), systems engineering (SE) research, and engineering capabilities for resilience, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems in support of the full range and scope of Department of Defense (DoD) missions and operations.

This Program Element (PE) addresses the National Defense Strategy priorities of increasing lethality, strengthening alliances and supporting Department business reform.  Engineering Science and Technology underpins improving department-wide practices of evaluating and improving the lethality of complex systems through modeling and simulation and engineering capabilities for resilience.  Improvements to the Department's systems engineering and simulation capabilities have a profound effect on ensuring that we are able to quickly and affordably field a lethal Joint Force by addressing the interwoven dependencies in system and mission capabilities, rapidly evolving technologies, lifecycle considerations, and resource limitations in the face of dynamic threats and changing missions.  In addition, these engineering and modeling and simulation practices cross international boundaries and is an area of collaboration with our Allies; it improves the way we are able to train as an allied force and operate together on the battlefield.

M&amp;S is a key enabler of DoD capabilities; underpins innovative solutions meeting real-world national security challenges and ensuring technical superiority; acts as a force multiplier; saves resources; and saves lives.  The DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO), designated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) to be the focal point and advocate for DoD M&amp;S, enhances the DoD M&amp;S Enterprise by (1) enabling joint and cross-cutting cooperation and collaboration in identifying, developing and sustaining modeling and simulation solutions; and (2) promoting technology solutions, including common M&amp;S architectures, standards, and services that improve interoperability, reuse, and cost effectiveness of DoD M&amp;S.

The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to conduct systems research and improve the Department’s ability to develop and deploy complex weapon systems.  Greatly improved SE methods, processes and tools are essential to the DoD strategy to field systems that are agile, affordably sustainable, and ready to incorporate emerging technologies to address a full range of contingencies, in the face of constrained budgets and an aging workforce. The SERC consists of a network of 22 research universities from across the U.S. that work collaboratively to bring the best talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.

Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) addresses the need for the faster design of cost- and mission-effective DoD warfighting systems by conducting research and development in computational engineering tools, system performance models, and data analysis techniques. From early design and testing through validation, fielding and sustainment, these tools and techniques give decision makers the information needed to make better-informed decisions and ensure Warfighter and mission success. A digital engineering initiative, ERS increases design agility by increasing design options across the lifecycle, leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, fielding and sustainment of mission-effective and adaptable systems.  ERS uses an advanced science and technology driven approach to provide the following core capabilities: Set-Based Design (SBD), Computational Engineering and Large-Scale Data Analytics. With ERS, DoD is reducing risk in future systems development by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD’s high-performance computing assets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) improves design agility and cost-effectiveness during analysis and development leading to improvements in testing, manufacturing, fielding and sustainment of mission-effective and adaptable systems. Its products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks which integrate physics-based models and engineering tools to vastly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, optimize designs and improve architectures.  These improved architectures will enable systems to more rapidly adapt to changing technologies and threats.  ERS uses advanced science and technology methods to provide the following core capabilities: Set-Based Design (SBD), Computational Engineering and Large-Scale Data Analytics. These engineering improvements will accelerate delivery of advanced capabilities to the warfighter and address a geopolitical environment marked by rapidly changing threats, tactics, missions and technologies, and fiscal constraints. The pace of change renders current point-design approaches unsustainable in both cost and time.  ERS methods and tools help engineers integrate advanced technologies into systems affordably, at the speed of relevance.

ERS research and development aims to transition practical applications to programs within the DoD, while continuing to evolve and develop future capabilities. ERS focuses on new concepts for implementing an integrated suite of modern computational engineering tools, models, simulations and related capabilities, and tradespace assessment and visualization tools with an architecture aligned with acquisition and operational business processes. These integrated tools will operate within a framework that supports transparency, inclusion and data-driven decision-making in an innovative environment that provides advanced knowledge management, including data retention and lessons-learned, and enables multi-community collaboration. ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process (e.g., increased/easier use of High-Performance Computing, web-based analysis with large data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis).  These new computational and model-based frameworks adapt advanced design and modeling approaches from Government, industry, and academia to enable our Nation to affordably deliver warfighting capability at the speed of relevance. ERS provides the capability to fully explore and identify key performance parameters and inform the requirements process. With ERS, DoD is reducing risk of future systems development by using high-fidelity modeling and advanced analyses of design options, as well as linking candidate platforms to traditional modeling and simulation toolkits and employing DoD’s high-performance computing assets. ERS leverages existing investments in surface and subsurface ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles, radio frequency, meshing and geometry models. Future domains, driven by Service requirements, may include future developments in Space, Hypersonics, Electronic Warfare and Directed Energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to keep pace with evolving weapons technologies.  Aligned with the National Defense Strategy, this program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future, building a more lethal force.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the science and technology (S&amp;T) Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  
  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the S&amp;T community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced T&amp;E technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
  The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
  The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation, and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons.  The HSST project continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number (M4.5-7.5) aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The Regenerative Storage Heater (RSH), which utilizes yttria-stabilized zirconia bricks, was demonstrated at temperatures in excess of 4500 R, allowing non-vitiated air up to Mach 7.5 conditions to be supplied.  Final design and fabrication of the air delivery system (ADS) was completed, which will permit uniform flow into the test cabin with variable pressure and temperature from multiple sources, including the RSH.  Upon installation of the ADS in HAPCAT, the facility will undergo checkout runs to validate its operation to support DoD weapon systems.
  The design for a free-jet, variable Mach nozzle (VMN) for use in HAPCAT was initiated.  Such a capability will permit much more accurate simulation of transient operations along a flight trajectory in a free-jet configuration.  The design of the VMN will also serve as a risk-reduction effort for a larger-scale VMN for use in the future full-scale facility.
  Efforts continued on the design, fabrication, and installation of a variable Mach number direct-connect nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities that will provide flight-equivalent Mach numbers between 4 and 6 at true temperatures.  The nozzle utilizes a metallic flexible wall to vary the Mach number while withstanding the high temperatures.  It will be integrated into the HAPCAT facility upon completion for checkout.
  The development of a high-pressure tunable-diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) continued for eventual integration into HAPCAT to provide accurate air temperature measurements at high temperatures and pressures, which will be used for facility control and determination of facility conditions. The TDLAS system will have uses in other facilities as well for temperature measurements.
  The arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.  The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  
  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance.  Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle.  Tests were conducted using a seven degree cone model to evaluate test techniques and boundary layer transition measurement capabilities between various facilities.  Tests of a boost-glide vehicle were completed in a quiet wind tunnel environment and a traditional, “noisy” wind tunnel environment, providing insight into the effects of flow field disturbances on boundary layer transition.
  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) facilities at Calspan University at Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC), enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility.  The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities.  The HSST project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   
  The HSST project completed development of a ground based, portable high altitude light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system to measure atmospheric conditions (density, temperature, pressure, wind speed/direction, oxygen/water content) along a hypersonic vehicle’s flight path.  This technology is a significant advancement over current methods, which employ balloons carrying sensors to sample the atmosphere.  The LIDAR will improve the accuracy of characterizing high altitude atmospheric conditions. This atmospheric data is needed to assess the performance and operability of air-breathing missiles and boost-glide vehicles during development.  Testing and demonstration of LIDAR atmospheric sensing was completed and the portable system was transitioned to support test programs at coastal flight test ranges to demonstrate system performance in a maritime environment.
  The HSST project continued the design and development of a UAV-Based Range capability to support hypersonic flight testing.  This capability aims to provide a more agile, flexible, and cost-effective method for providing support to hypersonic flight tests in the areas of telemetry, atmospheric sensing, optical imaging, flight safety, and other fields to aid in the development of hypersonic vehicles.  The capability will reduce the requirement and high-costs of the “string of pearls” collection of air, sea, and land resources used for hypersonic flight tests.  Several different technologies within the HSST project will be integrated as part of the UAV-Based Range.  
  Development of an airborne version of the already completed ground LIDAR system continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system on a crewed aircraft in preparation for implementation on an un-crewed vehicle.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.
  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.  This technology will be integrated as part of a UAV-Based Range capability as well.
  The fabrication and installation of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Un-crewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration was completed.  The system was integrated onto a Global Hawk and was deployed to Hawaii in support of flight testing in the area.
  Tests were conducted in a hypervelocity shock tunnel on a hollow-cylinder flare test article in order to acquire shock-boundary layer interaction data.  Such data will be used to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes used in the community for hypersonic analyses.  The dataset will help advance the state of the art in computational tools.</r2:Description>

Efforts will include demonstration of new flight test techniques, improvements in instrumentation, and continued improvement and validation of CFD codes.
  The HAPCAT clean-air, variable Mach number testbed will complete; this will include the design, fabrication, testing and installation of the ADS components. The ADS will combine three separate streams of pressurized air, each at different temperatures and pressures, and deliver them to the hypersonic nozzle of the HAPCAT facility.  The air streams are regulated through the ADS to produce a specified flight enthalpy level appropriate for the clean air flight condition being simulated in the test. 
  Upgrades to the LENS Tunnel to increase productivity and accuracy during operation will continue. 
  Further validation of the spin-coil designs for the arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development will continue.  Completion of boundary layer transition efforts will establish a new baseline protocol and recommendations for hypersonic aero performance predictions.
  Efforts will continue to assess the technical performance and CONOPS for a HALE UAS configured to support flight T&amp;E of hypersonic vehicles. A telemetry system onboard a UAS capable of collecting data from a hypersonic flight vehicle over broad open ocean areas will be demonstrated.  Efforts will continue to develop atmospheric sensing and optical imaging systems on uncrewed platforms to support flight tests.</r2:Text>

These developments includes airborne demonstration of the LIDAR system and the optical imaging system on-board manned aircraft and additional airborne testing of the telemetry system on a Global Hawk UAV. 
The HAPCAT facility will begin initial checkout operations to verify the ability to mix various air supply sources and provide a uniform, steady flow to the test cabin using clean air to support aerothermal, aero-optic, and propulsion testing of hypersonic systems. The use of a variable-Mach number direct connect nozzle will also be demonstrated in the facility.
Progress will be made in the design of the variable-Mach number free-jet nozzle for eventual integration into the HAPCAT facility.  The development will feed directly into a larger-scale variant for use in the full-scale facility to be built in the future.
Additional tests and analysis will be conducted in an effort to construct a methodology for predicting boundary layer transition on hypersonic vehicles through ground testing and computations.  This development includes a HIFiRE-5b flight-matching experiment to assess ground-to-flight comparison capabilities and a scale-effects test entry using a boost-glide geometry.  Such work will supplement the previous work performed in this area under the HSST project.</r2:Text>

Flight test infrastructure improvements will continue to enable better data collection including high resolution optics, atmospheric measurements, and terminal scoring capability. These improvements will also enable flexible test scheduling by placing instrumentation onboard a UAV fleet to increase the op tempo of flight tests.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems as well as between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L- and S- Band frequencies are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry and cellular based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked and cellular based telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The SET project performed risk reduction on a ruggedized Ethernet switch for airborne systems in support of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) networked telemetry projects.  The ruggedized Ethernet switch addresses CTEIP requirements to fully instrument test aircraft with network enable instrumentation packages to support bi-directional telemetry.  The ruggedized switch provides the Ethernet backbone on the aircraft which supports the transport of packetized telemetry data from the onboard instrumentation systems to the telemetry transceiver which transmits the data to the control room.
  The SET project performed risk reduction on a networked data recorder and data transmission scheme in support of CTEIP networked telemetry projects.  The networked data recorder addresses CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event.  This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur.
  A scheme enabling more efficient handling of multiple priority test data and communications between the network router and telemetry receiver was demonstrated showing the capability to assign transmission priority to specific test parameters ensuring critical test data is transmitted using the limited spectral resources available for testing.  This technology is required to support CTEIP data transmission requirements and the implementation of a networked telemetry capability. 
  A multi-band transceiver operating in the L/S/C-Band spectrum employing multiple advanced modulation schemes was demonstrated showing the ability to change both the frequency and modulation scheme of the telemetry system in near real time based on telemetry link performance and environmental conditions.  This technology determines the performance of the telemetry link and selects the optimal modulation scheme based on current link conditions, accounting for issues such as multipath.
  The SET project developed technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a Global Hawk platform was developed and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory environment.  A modular digital beam-forming solution to control a phased array antenna and track multiple targets simultaneously was matured.  These technologies will significantly reduce the system complexity for an airborne phased array antenna, providing savings in terms of size, weight, and power consumption.    
  Development of a software-based technology solution to accurately characterize RF spectrum utilization on DoD test ranges continued. This technology will develop the interfaces to existing range RF spectrum scheduling and resource management tools and also implement a standard set of spectrum usage metrics to quantify RF spectrum usage based on times of day and test programs. This tool will transition initially to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB to support RF spectrum management activities, aid in the identification of future spectrum requirements, and quantify the impact of inadequate access to spectrum, in terms of program cost and schedule.</r2:Description>

An L/S/C-Band transceiver will be transitioned to support both the CTEIP transceiver development and testing at the Edwards AFB RF Laboratory.  The following will be transitioned to CTEIP projects: technology capable of reconfiguring the data modulation scheme based on telemetry link conditions, technology enabling more efficient handling of priority test data and communication between the network router and telemetry transceiver, technology enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of transmitted test data over a telemetry network, and an Ethernet switch for airborne applications.  Technology enabling the compression of PCM data will be further matured. Efforts to develop spectrum management tools to optimize the use of available RF spectrum and accurately quantify RF spectrum usage on DoD test ranges will continue.
  The SET project will transition technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of long range missiles including hypersonic weapons.  An S-Band phased array antenna with a modular digital beam-forming controller will be integrated into a Global Hawk and used to support over-the-horizon telemetry requirements for a Navy hypersonic flight test in CY 2017.
  The SET project will initiate development of a steerable, multi-band antenna for airborne platforms.  This antenna technology will employ either mechanical or digital methods to point the telemetry link to a specific ground receive antenna. The pointing of the telemetry link will enable spectrum reuse through spatial diversity, enabling two test platforms to transmit test data within the same portion of RF spectrum.  The SET project will initiate development of radio technology that can utilize alternate spectrum in the upper frequency bands.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced time, space, position information (TSPI) instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.   The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during operational test (OT) and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Major thrusts included continuing efforts in advanced sensors, TSPI instrumentation, warfighter physical and cognitive assessment under various workloads and mitigation of test range encroachments.  
  Development completed on a passive imaging technology to derive size, shape, mass, drag coefficients, velocity and vectors for individual fragments during live warhead testing. This technology allows testers to quickly characterize the fragment characteristics and distribution from a munition explosion.  This effort transitioned to the U.S. Air Force to support warhead effectiveness and lethality testing.
  The AIST project completed the development of a system to measure and assess warfighter cognitive performance under realistic conditions during a T&amp;E event. This technology transitioned to the U.S. Army’s Test &amp; Evaluation Command (ATEC).  A personnel tracking system using amplitude modulation (AM) band signals was developed, but requires testing in a relevant environment before transition.  The AIST project continued development of technology to evaluate back face deformation of body armor from a blunt trauma event, with final testing planned at Aberdeen Test Center’s Light Armor Range Complex.  
  The AIST project continued an effort to develop a high fidelity model which takes into account the noisier acoustic properties of shallow water environments (120 feet to 900 feet) for littoral T&amp;E.  The model will support early evaluation of undersea test range technologies (e.g., hydrophone arrays, new communication signals/modulations, transducers, and portable instrumentation).</r2:Description>

TSPI technologies will be further developed to support: data collection in GPS-denied environments with a focus toward data fusion from disparate sensors, TSPI on high dynamic systems such as missiles and projectiles, and real time casualty assessment.
  Advanced sensor initiatives for non-intrusive applications will include multimodal transducers, and self-registering/self-calibrating sensors.  Sensing applications will include weapon system orientation, body armor blunt trauma evaluation, air launched stores separation, and weapon angle of incidence measurement at impact.  Advanced data transformation initiatives will develop technologies for adaptive computing, virtual/synthetic instrumentation, data compression, wireless on-board data transport and improved data storage density.  Other areas of investigation will include micro-miniaturization of electronic components for non-intrusive applications.  AIST will continue to investigate technologies for mitigating range environmental encroachment issues such as alternative energy interference with range tracking systems.  Additional efforts will include human performance measurement and assessment, specifically human interaction with unmanned systems and the evaluation of the interaction of the warfighter and weapons/equipment and interactions between individual warfighters in team-based holistic assessments.
  The AIST project will complete technologies to measure: fragment characteristics from warhead testing; TSPI using distinctive near-field patterns from AM signals; and mental load of warfighters during test events.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) and Software Intensive Systems (SIS) (C4T) project addresses test technology gaps in the rapid advancement of C4T warfighting systems.  The C4T technology gaps are driven by the more complex environments and distributed systems (e.g. Anti-Access Arial Denial (A2AD); Manned and Unmanned Systems (MUM-T)); big data and intelligence (e.g. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA)); and more software intensive systems (e.g. F-35).  The technology development efforts within the C4T project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on S&amp;T Communities of Interest (CoIs).  C4T is developing technologies, including leveraging advancements in machine learning, to analyze and evaluate the increasing mass of structured and unstructured data generated by C4I and SIS testing.  The technologies are required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g. target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking, and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.  
 The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester’s ability to effectively support knowledge management, rapid analysis of “Big Data," and automated test reporting.  The C4T project advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and C4I and SIS systems accessing and providing information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The C4T project completed the development of near-real time automated multi-band infrared target segmentation technology using state-of-the-art neural network and deep learning based algorithms.
  The C4T project developed M&amp;S technologies to support real-time assessments of complex environments such as undersea environments.  These technologies provided an acoustic propagation model, both narrow and broad band, of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance in various maritime tactical environments.  The model included a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.
  The C4T project developed technologies to provide a reliable, fast, and cost-effective approach that enables direct injection Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) testing of next generation weapon systems.  These technologies will enable live assets to sense and respond to the latest threat stimulus without regard to whether the stimulus is real or synthetic.
  The C4T project developed a configuration optimization of test support networks.  Technologies included planning expeditionary tests, managing bandwidth and spectrum contention with a networked system under test, managing battery consumption, providing Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) data during live tests and providing continuous re-planning capability. These technologies will address deficiencies in Army Operational Test (OT) for network-enabled technologies.
  The C4T project initiated the development of deep neutral network technologies for real-time Automated Target Recognition (ATR) using real and synthetic data.  These technologies are being developed to support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target recognition.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and autonomous systems support every domain of warfare -- operating in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The UAST project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of unmanned systems, particularly in testing autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system’s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence tools.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and artificially intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The UAST project continued test technology development supporting the near term challenges identified in the 2013–2038 DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, such as, integrating DoD unmanned systems within the National Airspace and safely operating unmanned aerial systems within the Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).  The UAST project collaborated with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation Working Group to ensure that the UAST project is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.
  The UAST project explored technologies required for T&amp;E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces.  The UAST project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  The UAST project continued investments in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  The UAST project continued developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will also prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, range boundaries, and warning areas.  The UAST project initiated an effort to develop a software tool that will enable testers to monitor the internal autonomous processing states of a system under test without interfering with its operations or requiring modification to the system’s software or hardware.  The UAST project completed efforts that rapidly identify challenging test scenarios for an undersea unmanned vehicle (UUV) under test.  The effort identified performance boundaries for autonomy as they relate to the environment, mission, and vehicle state spaces; this technology transitioned to the Naval Undersea Warfare Center-Keyport.
  The UAST project has initiated development of technology to address the T&amp;E of ground and air autonomy using optimization algorithms to rapidly generate salient test scenarios.</r2:Description>

The technologies will be fully compliant with TENA and suitable for integration on the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability network.  
  The UAST project will continue to develop test technologies that address mid-term UAS test challenges associated with autonomy and initiate efforts to explore the far term challenges of testing system intelligence.  These efforts will include research on test technologies to measure the logical flow of sensing data to perception, decisions, and action.  The UAST project will invest in complementary tools to predict UAS behavior by monitoring how autonomous systems process data in response to environmental changes.  The UAST project will investigate technologies for T&amp;E of UAS-to-UAS and human-to-UAS interactions.
  The UAST project will complete the development of technologies to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies will be TENA compliant to facilitate transition across the MRTFB.  The UAST project will complete the development of the Strategic Autonomy T&amp;E Investment Plan. The UAST project will complete research on autonomous system test planning technology which will identify the most pertinent test plans for maritime, air, and ground-based autonomous systems, enabling testers to identify the degree of regression testing required for autonomous systems upon changes to hardware and/or software.  UAST will continue coordination with the Autonomy COI and relevant Service organizations to improve T&amp;E of autonomous systems.</r2:Text>

The AAIT project will continue to initiate and develop technologies to support autonomous system test planning, autonomous system test execution, and autonomous system performance assessment.  Efforts within test planning will include predicting autonomous behavior for testing and assuring thorough testing of autonomous systems.  Investments in test execution will include:  enhancing safety of autonomous system testing; creating test environments that are complex, immersive, and reactive; and adapting ranges to cognitive, autonomous system testing.  Developments under performance assessment will include: testing and evaluating UAS-to-UAS and human-to-UAS interactions and measuring autonomous system reliability.
  The AAIT project will investigate new technologies specifically for creating faster-than-real-time versions of autonomies.  Developing this technology will allow multiple copies of a black-box autonomy to be run in modeled environments to gather statistically significant information regarding the performance boundaries of an autonomy.
  The AAIT project will complete development of technologies that automatically learn conditions for activating vulnerabilities deep within an autonomous system, using machine learning and backward chaining techniques to determine system level inputs that induce failure.</r2:Text>

Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will require advancement and maturation of nascent test technologies.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats and test environments, executing cyberspace tests, and performing cyberspace test analysis and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Hypersonic programs need insight on aerothermal effects of their system at high Mach (15+ Mach) to optimize their design and maximize performance. These programs need insight on dynamic events (shroud separation, etc.) at high velocities. Shock tunnels are used to evaluate plasma effects (nose tip &amp; heat shield ablation), control surface performance, boundary layer transition (laminar–turbulent transition), and dynamic events at high Mach number. The Rapid Insertion of Test Technology (RITT) project addressed immediate test technology needs enabling the test community to support required test scenarios for hypersonic concepts under development in the science and technology (S&amp;T) community.  This project enabled the development of near-term test technology solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing hypersonic technology demonstrators.  These test technology developments aligned directly with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) in support of hypersonics. RITT developed rapid ground test technology solutions in high velocity, high enthalpy test environments directly supporting ongoing hypersonic demonstrator development. The RITT project completed advanced test and evaluation (T&amp;E) technologies for ground test, test instrumentation, and diagnostics systems for use when testing hypersonic systems in high velocity, high enthalpy test environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>This is a new Program Element. 
Prior year funds under its previous MD5 nomenclature in PE 0603580D8Z/607 received FY 2016 ($5.000 million), FY 2017 ($25.000 million), FY 2018 ($25.500 million), and FY 2019 ($15.000 million) as a Congressional interest program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), previously executed under the name of the MD5 National Security Technology Accelerator (MD5), is a program office within the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) and aligned under the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).  NSIN seeks to develop deep partnerships between the Department of Defense (DoD) and non-traditional problem-solving partners to include students and faculty at colleges and universities.  The speed and reactivity of the modern technology-threat environment challenges the traditional top-down model of defense problem-solving and capability development.  Mitigating these challenges require developing internal workforce and organizational competencies related to problem framing, knowledge and resource sharing, and non-traditional partnerships.  Consistent with the National Defense Strategy, and FY 2020 OMB/OSTP research and development budget priorities for sustaining a military technological advantage, NSIN has a portfolio of innovation efforts that (1) accelerates capability development leveraging non-traditional collaborators and novel approaches, (2) augments the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) through commercialization of DoD lab technology, and (3) enhances the DoD workforce through programs that develop new ways of solving critical problems. 

This program seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the U.S. military over adversaries by increasing interactions between uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD with innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD.  This is accomplished by providing training and tools to these DoD “intrapreneurs” enabling them to find new ways to identify, frame, and solve problems as well as opening avenues to implement the solutions they create.  Additionally, the programs executed create opportunities for external innovators and entrepreneurs to be exposed to DoD problems and demonstrate possible solutions.

NSIN carries out its mission via three portfolios of effort: Service, Collaboration, and Acceleration.  The Service Portfolio is specifically designed to create new pathways to national security service for entrepreneurs and technologists that want to work with the DoD to solve problems in non-traditional ways.  Collaboration provides problem-solving and new ideation spaces or Maker Centers for warfighters, academia and early-stage ventures to collectively identify novel applications and concepts to DoD problem sets.  Acceleration programs that identify opportunities inside DoD that can be commercialized, or apply technology relevant to warfighter problem sets and advance the novel applications or solutions are created within the Collaboration Portfolio.

Prior year funds under its previous MD5 nomenclature in PE 0603580D8Z/607 received FY 2016 ($5.000 million), FY 2017 ($25.000 million), FY 2018 ($25.500 million), and FY 2019 ($15.000 million) as a Congressional interest program.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), previously executed under the name of the MD5 National Security Technology Accelerator (MD5), is a program office within the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) and aligned under the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).  NSIN seeks to develop deep partnerships between the Department of Defense (DoD) and non-traditional problem-solving partners to include students and faculty at colleges and universities.  The speed and reactivity of the modern technology-threat environment challenges the traditional top-down model of defense problem-solving and capability development.  Mitigating these challenges require developing internal workforce and organizational competencies related to problem framing, knowledge and resource sharing, and non-traditional partnerships.  Consistent with the National Defense Strategy, and FY 2020 OMB/OSTP research and development budget priorities for sustaining a military technological advantage, NSIN has a portfolio of innovation efforts that (1) accelerates capability development leveraging non-traditional collaborators and novel approaches, (2) augments the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) through commercialization of DoD lab technology, and (3) enhances the DoD workforce through programs that develop new ways of solving critical problems. 

This program seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the U.S. military over adversaries by increasing interactions between uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD with innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD.  This is accomplished by providing training and tools to these DoD “intrapreneurs” enabling them to find new ways to identify, frame, and solve problems as well as opening avenues to implement the solutions they create.  Additionally, the programs executed create opportunities for external innovators and entrepreneurs to be exposed to DoD problems and demonstrate possible solutions.

NSIN, under its previous MD5 nomenclature, has been a Congressional interest program that has received funding in FY 2016 ($5.000 million), FY 2017 ($25.000 million), FY 2018 ($25.500 million), and FY 2019 ($15.000 million).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic mission of this program element (PE) is to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.  The Operational Energy Capability Improvement Fund (OECIF) incentivizes S&amp;T to promote long term change in DoD capabilities so they are better aligned with the Operational Energy Strategy.  OECIF generally fosters innovation to improve operational energy performance and has two key mission aspects:  first, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that will improve DoD military capabilities and possibly reduce costs; and second, to establish within and among the military Services institutional momentum to continue those innovations.  

OECIF funds serve as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising operational energy innovation to be sustained by the Services; therefore, OECIF generally emphasizes supporting or establishing transitions rather than one-off projects.  OECIF investments also show areas of Departmental level interest.  The increase in OECIF funding for FY 2020 is aimed to help shape Service investments across six core functional areas within this operational energy domain:  Space Solar Collection, Power Beaming Transmission, Power Beaming Reception, Receiver Power Distribution, Architecture Analytics, and Supporting Technologies.

It is imperative that DoD sustain a competitive position to innovate and manage stealthy and portable power beaming initiatives which provide freedom of movement for the warfighter.  OECIF projects are selected annually from Service and Combatant Command proposals that align with the Department’s 2016 Operational Energy Strategy and support that fiscal year’s OECIF theme.  The theme reflects the Department's priorities and focuses S&amp;T investments.  The Department is due for a new Operational Energy Strategy, and OECIF is actively shaping and contributing to the Innovation sections.  Ultimately, the true value of an OECIF project is dependent on a successful transition to the Warfighter.  The benefits may be realized through materiel efforts (fielded equipment, enhanced sub-systems) or non-materiel improvements (i.e., modeling and simulations capabilities, education and training, and development of standards).  The overall aim is to improve the operational effectiveness of the Joint Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The increase in OECIF funding for FY 2020 is aimed to help shape Service investment in Space Solar Advanced Technology.  Near-peer competitors are overmatching DoD in power beaming and space solar technologies for battlefield advantage, necessitating a critical OECIF effort to address the shortfalls.  Per the findings and recommendations of the recent DoD study “Opportunities and Challenges for Space Solar for Remote Installations," measured, comprehensive investments in Advanced Technology Development will be made in six focus areas:  (1) Space Solar Collection; (2) Power Beaming Transmission; (3) Power Beaming Reception; (4) Receiver Power Distribution; (5) Architecture Analytics; and (6) Integrating Technologies.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

J-DEPLOI, which began in FY14, will still be active.  J-DEPLOI plans to complete software development and testing, MBPS integration, and plan transition of the program to MPBS management and PACOM users.

The FY15 vehicles program will continue.  The Thermally Efficient Cylinders program will test the single-cylinder engine with an optimized coating and piston and will begin laboratory preparations for multi-cylinder testing.  The TVEK program will complete the SIL testing with all sub-systems integrated into the vehicle, evaluate the sub-system fuel savings and M&amp;S results from the Matlab Simulink and the Army Joint Operational Energy Initiative (JOEI) model to determine optimal kit architecture, start integration of kits in the HEMTT and LVSR vehicles, initiate electromagnetic interference testing of sub-systems, and develop vehicle test plans and agreements with testing facilities.  The Automation/Smart Cruise Control program will complete Phase II by conducting convoy testing, deliver a final report, and provide the developed technology.  The M&amp;S for Light-Weighting program will incorporate novel materials for analysis and compare with the baseline system model.

The FY16 unmanned vehicles programs will continue.  The Reliable, Efficient, Tactical UAS Power System program will test the second generation engine for power output, specific fuel consumption, altitude, and product reliability.  The Hybrid Tiger team will begin the flight testing phase validating the performance models and tuning flight controller gains, and refine software to emphasize optimal hybrid mode transitions and increased autonomy for soaring.  The HTVE-UE program will continue base tasks related to component fabrication and breadboard assembly and testing, execute at-sea test planning, and perform initial system deployment; and continue studies and analyses related to FDECO interoperability, HTV characterization/environmental considerations, and CONOPS.  The Aluminum Seawater Power program will go through the next round of component development and testing, and begin integration testing.  The Small Turboprop Engine Range/Power Enhancement program will begin engine detailed design and acquire long lead materials for engine fabrication.  The JP-8 Based Fuel Cell Power program will conduct physical integration of the JP-8 reformer and solid oxide fuel cell and all supporting hardware, and conduct the first two iterations of system level testing to determine weak parts of the system design.   

The programs begun in FY17 will continue to ramp up during this fiscal year. 

New programs will start in FY18.  The focus of these new programs is likely to reflect input from the Services, various research Communities of Interest within DoD, such as Energy and Power, Ground and Sea Platforms, and Air Platforms, and any developing gaps or opportunities identified by ODASD(OE).</r2:Text>

OECIF will self-fund necessary overhead from the program baseline, approximately $5.000 million annually, to include program management, business reform tools, and strategic partnerships, etc.  

Established efforts include:
• The FY 2013 OECIF project, Tactical Microgrid Standardization, will submit a draft Military Standard (MIL-STD) to the Defense Standardization Program Office for approval.  A multi-national demonstration is planned for inter-operability among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners showing applicability of the standard as part of the Capable Logistician 2019 exercise.

• FY 2014 OECIF projects are focused on analytical methods and tools for considering operational energy in DoD planning and decision processes.  Analytic tools were developed to consider energy vulnerability during the Joint Planning Process. Spring warfighter evaluations and training are planned.  DoD-wide model, scenario, and data updates continue with new model versions scheduled to be released in October 2019.  Analytical tool investment underpins the Congressionally mandated energy key performance parameter in addition to warfighting battlefield tools.

• FY 2015 OECIF tactical vehicle improvement projects completed the final year of OECIF funding.  One effort completed a critical milestone for procurement testing and successfully identified Program Manager Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (PM THAAD) as its first transition partner.  A system demonstration is planned for FY 2019.  Battlefield electrification yields increased operating longevity in addition to decreased mean-time between failure and significantly less frequent refueling requirements.

• FY 2016 OECIF projects focused on improving the operational energy performance of unmanned aerial, surface, undersea and ground vehicles.  Multiple projects will conclude in FY 2019 with efforts resulting in improved engine design, energy hybridization for increased performance capabilities, and fuel efficiencies.  These projects are expected to transition in FY 2020-2021.

• FY 2017 OECIF projects support two main topics:  Thermal and Power Management Technologies for High Pulse Power Systems; and Wireless Transmission of Energy in the Far-Field.  These investments focus on the energy and power sub-systems that enable directed energy weapons as well as future warfighting concepts with unlimited power and communications.  Efforts are demonstrating early success and pushing technology forward across wireless transmission in far-field, laser beaming, space solar, and photovoltaic testing.

Increased lethality of directed energy weapons is enabled by advanced power and thermal innovation in: 
• Lab-based prototypes of thermal management systems to bolster mission-success of DEW systems;
• Hybrid energy storage module units to enable continuous firing of pulse load capability and reduced logistics; and
• Energy management systems for high power payloads that increase fuel savings as well as improve power and thermal transient capability.

Resiliency is bolstered by far field wireless energy development of: 
• Alternative manufacturing methods for lightweight flexible high efficiency III-V solar cells that provide a breakthroughs in cost reduction as well as decreased production time for the next generation space solar concepts;
• Alternative solar cell materials, such as perovskites that increase mobile power generation capability by a factor of three as well as decreasing weight and increasing efficiency; and
• Mobile power meters for preventative maintenance and agile logistics.

Innovative operational concepts can be realized with new battlefield technologies including: 
• Advances in novel space solar collection and wireless power beaming technologies which lead to increased energy resiliency and assured energy supply;
• Studies on space solar on energy resupply capability that provide knowledge towards future investment strategies;
• Laser light power beaming technologies including the receiver, transmitter and safety system that enable infinite persistence communications and ISR assets;
• Millimeter wave power beaming technologies including rectenna and sterling engine prototypes to enable persistent operations; and
• Free-space optical communication system that provides a highly directional, jam-resistant, secure communications via an energy stream.

Finally, business reform is driven by the development of an artificial intelligence portfolio analysis tool that will speed operational energy S&amp;T developments and improve investment decisions.

Innovative advances in power and thermal management as well as wireless transmission of energy underpin lethal warfighting capability and are expected to contribute to increased power generation and distribution capabilities, reduced energy supply line burdens, and new autonomous power paradigms.  The breadth of applications include directed energy / electronic weaponry, persistent autonomous systems, power generation and distribution on the ground and in space, and advanced communication systems. 

• FY 2018 OECIF projects are one-year studies to identify operational energy S&amp;T gaps in the near-, mid-, and far-term.  The studies will deliver community vetted, operational energy investment roadmaps.  Once these projects are completed, they will be the pathway to feed the next operational energy strategy and they will inform the topic selection for FY 2020 OECIF proposals.

• FY 2019 OECIF projects directly support "Enhanced Energy Storage to Improve Lethality and Warfighting Performance" consistent with the National Defense Strategy.  Investments focus on standardization, safety, and advanced performance of energy storage solutions with consideration for business reform opportunities. 

Business reform is driven by rapid demonstration of:
• The use of rapidly manufactured and field expendable logistics: surface/sub-surface vehicles for bulk fuel delivery;
• Demonstration of innovative inverter technology for vehicle-to-grid energy storage and micro-gridding enabling technology for autonomous vehicle recharging;
• Application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to demonstrate increased development speeds for rapid-recharge antiferroelectric capacitors;
• Unique aerodynamic designs for on-board UAS energy fuel storage;
• Hybrid power management and storage for Group 3 UAS; and
• Mechanical demonstrations of in-flight energy storage for both platforms and weapon systems.  

OECIF supports storage safety innovation in:
• Novel aqueous battery chemistries that do not burn and have no fixed dependence on form factor, offering the warrior and platforms greater safety and flexibility;
• Energy storage devices to support expeditionary basing requirements; and
• Novel Li-Ion internal short detection system which senses at extremely low sensitivity levels allowing early warning to mitigate malfunctions or dangers.

Energy storage is also a key component of energy resiliency and FY 2019 OECIF investments support:
• Innovative hydrogen energy storage at bases;
• Mobile power monitoring of energy storage and loads for preventative maintenance and agile logistics;  
• Integration of monolithically integrated, ultra-thin solar powered solid state lithium energy storage for space solar applications; and
• Mechanical developments supporting flywheel storage technology.

Finally, FY 2019 OECIF emphasizes standardization with the potential to save the department millions of dollars including:
• Standardization of Li-Ion 6T drop-in replacement batteries;
• Standardization of Li-Ion storage containers for world-wide shipping and development of a DoD-wide Li-Ion database; and
• Standardization of high voltage energy storage module to support Directed Energy/Electronic Warfare.

Innovative advances in energy storage underpins lethal warfighting capability and the FY 2019 efforts are expected to significantly contribute to silent watch, greater and safer on-board power for payloads, increased unrefueled range and endurance, reduced energy supply line burdens, and the ability to support autonomous operations.  The breadth of applications includes directed energy / electronic weaponry, the dismounted warfighters combat load, long range and endurance of autonomous systems, and storage of energy in and from space.

The Services submitted a record $175.000 million in prioritized proposal requests for energy storage types (batteries, fuel cells, ultra-capacitors, flywheels, compressed gases, thermal storage, betavoltaics, pumped hydro energy/power density, safety, standardization, hybridization, reliability, cyclic behavior, and efficiency).  Concerted industry outreach efforts with the Defense Innovation Unit and Manufacturing Technology programs increase the likelihood of near-term transition.</r2:Text>

• FY 2019 programs will continue with their technology development efforts, demonstrations, and deliverables.

OUSD(R&amp;E) emphasizes modernization to shape the future force.  In FY 2020, OECIF projects are expected to emphasize space, weapons, and electronic warfare as emerging capabilities and will be shaped by FY 2018 Operational Energy S&amp;T gaps and roadmaps.  Near-peer competitors are overmatching DoD in power beaming and space solar technologies for battlefield advantage, necessitating a critical OECIF effort to address the shortfalls.  Per the findings and recommendations of the recent DoD study “Opportunities and Challenges for Space Solar for Remote Installations," measured, comprehensive investments at the Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) level will be made in six focus areas:
 
(1) Space Solar Collection – Low-cost, lightweight photovoltaics through revolutionary production methods are key to manufacturing at scale.  Once produced, thermal, radiation, and space qualification testing is needed.  FY 2020 investment level:  $7.200 million.
(2) Power Beaming Transmission – High-efficiency, compact microwave/millimeter-wave/optical source integration with power transmitters is needed.  High specific power transmitters, particularly in the short-wave infrared, will be built and tested.  FY 2020 investment level:  $5.900 million.
(3) Power Beaming Reception – Tactically deployable ground receivers for power beaming do not currently exist.  Variable power density-compatible, portable, ruggedized, modular receivers will be developed and tested.  FY 2020 investment level:  $6.100 million.
(4) Receiver Power Distribution – Deployed microgrid and storage integration for power receiver usage is required for effective utilization. Operations scenarios for crewed and autonomous users will be formulated and hardware prototypes implemented.  FY 2020 investment level:  $2.400 million.
(5) Architecture Analytics – Campaign modeling and examination of the implications of different means of energy conversion and ground and space segment approaches will critically focus investments and drive Conops development.  FY 2020 investment level:  $3.000 million.
(6) Integrating Technologies – Leap ahead technologies in large area metrology, high-altitude receiver craft, thermal management, high voltage management, and airborne tether technologies are critical to ensuring integration of the final capability.  FY 2020 investment level:  $5.400 million.

These elements kick-off efforts for power beaming and space solar capabilities to increase warfighter lethality and reduce logistical burdens.  For contexts of ground-to-ground, elevated, high-altitude, low earth orbit, and higher orbits, the progression of power beaming capabilities to include longer links and higher powers will provide a credible path to an operational capability.  OECIF will continue engagement with OSD, Services, and CCMDs for validation of development strategies for FY 2021 and beyond.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. The CWMD Systems program supports the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for analytic cells at defense agencies and under Combatant Commands; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, testing, and evaluation of materiel and non-materiel solutions to develop CWMD capabilities.  Funds are used for development and integration of hardware or software technologies; contractor personnel for analytic cells at defense agencies and under Combatant Commands; research partnerships with DoD and civilian academic institutions, FFRDCs and UARCs; and interagency table-top exercises conducted on behalf of Combatant Commands.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  This program will evaluate integrated technologies, representative modes or prototype systems in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security equipment (PSE) technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD PSE RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood," January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide PSE advanced component development and prototypes for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The projects under the Program Element either (a) lead to Programs of Record – which can transition to Program Element 0604161D8Z for systems development and demonstration (SDD); (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Security Policy Verification Committee and the Physical Security Equipment Action Group.  These groups work together to avoid duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear forensics is the thorough collection, analysis and evaluation of radiological and nuclear material in a pre-detonation state and post-detonation radiological or nuclear materials, devices and debris, as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and preventing future attacks in a timely manner.

A credible nuclear forensics program is essential to preventing nuclear terrorism by deterring nations from sponsoring nuclear terrorism.  The purpose of this program is to develop systems to provide timely and accurate information to national leadership in the area of nuclear forensics. 

Per DoDD 2060.04 OSD AT&amp;L NCB provides guidance and direction for the implementation of the Department of Defense National Technical Nuclear Forensics program.  NCB represents DoD interests in all areas of nuclear forensics but emphasizes post-detonation applications due to Presidential guidance assigning the department the lead role in develop, providing, and maintaining post-detonation nuclear forensics capability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AEDIS/AV supports DAE, CAE, and Service Chief responsibilities by providing critical information for acquisition analysis, oversight, and decisions. AEDIS/AV institutionalizes the management of data and business rules used in the Department’s acquisition decision making, and it integrates the acquisition data stored across multiple disparate Federal and Departmental organizations’ data sets and systems. The AEDIS/AV investment delivers a Department-wide accessible collection of acquisition information, techniques, and tools, including the Defense Acquisition Visibility Environment (DAVE), the Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval (DAMIR) capability, and acquisition data analysis capabilities as well as data access services and data standards via the Acquisition Visibility Data Matrix (AVDM). Funding supports enhancements to Acquisition Visibility through the definition, development, and fielding of concepts and tools for Department-wide data analysis for use across Congress and the Department, particularly in support of the DAE and his decision authority.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates promising and innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.  Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This initiative responds to Congressional direction for the Department to increase energy efficiency, reduce installation energy intensity, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy security. Emerging energy technologies offer DoD a cost effective opportunity to meet these requirements on its installations while reducing energy and operational costs. The DoD test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test bed's key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) Program is overseen by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Stability and Humanitarian Affairs (SHA) within the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low – Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) for Policy.  The HD R&amp;D Program coordinates with SHA and the with Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Geographical Combatant Commands (CCMD) to develop, demonstrate and validate cost-effective technologies for use in humanitarian demining via OCONUS operational field evaluations. The HD R&amp;D Program’s low-cost and highly effective technology reduces landmine and UXO threat to the local population and US forces, and bolsters host nations’ mine action capacity while improving DoD’s visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the USG, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments.  

The HD R&amp;D Program crafts a research and development plan based on CCMDs’ security cooperation and theater campaign plan objectives to advance the state-of-the-art of demining technology and evaluate prototype technology utilizing host nation humanitarian demining operations partners.  Continuous operations test data against live mines/UXO around the world is unavailable to any other DoD organization. Such data informs HD R&amp;D Program investment decisions and is leveraged by U.S. military countermine R&amp;D programs to improve U.S. forces’ technology.  In addition, the program conducts mine and UXO detector training at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of mil-to-mil training and partnerships.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 223 evaluations in 40 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program’s technologies have cleared 60.2 million square meters of the world’s toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 197,328 mines and UXO.

New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), CCMD Humanitarian Mine Action programs, international mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element’s work fulfills the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Following a rapid prototyping strategy, the program emphasizes the use/modification of existing, commercially-available equipment and components to build functional prototype equipment suited for humanitarian demining operations.  This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The increase from FY2019 to FY2020 is to underpin the additional projects that support the National Defense Strategy/SecDef top three priorities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) supports DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission; that comprehensively addresses all three National Defense Strategy lines of effort: to develop a more lethal joint force, strengthen alliances and attract new partners, and implement business practices for greater performance and affordability. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  For every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects, the program has leveraged $3 in foreign partner funding – from 76 foreign partners – and $2 in other U.S. Government funding, providing an overall 5:1 return on investment.  CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) supports DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP is the only Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program with this mission; that comprehensively addresses all three National Defense Strategy lines of effort: to develop a more lethal joint force, strengthen alliances and attract new partners, and implement business practices for greater performance and affordability. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  For every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects, the program has leveraged $3 in foreign partner funding – from 76 foreign partners – and $2 in other U.S. Government funding, providing an overall 5:1 return on investment.  CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>CWP provides funding on a competitive basis to DoD organizations to conduct cooperative research, development, test, and evaluation projects with foreign partners.  The goals of the CWP program are to: collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions, develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations, and strengthen current defense partnerships and developing new relationships. CWP selects projects for funding through an annual competitive selection process in accordance with Department of Defense and Combatant Command needs.

Overall, the program provided additional funding to projects that began in earlier selection cycles.  Currently, the funded portfolio includes projects with 13 different foreign partners.

Including prior year project selections, for FY 2019 selections, the following projects will encompass CWP funding in FY 2019 and FY 2020:

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently estimated at approximately $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impact and cost of corrosion are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228]: Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment.  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
The Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (PDUSD(AT&amp;L)) as the DoD Corrosion Executive in May 2003.  The DoD Corrosion Executive subsequently established a Corrosion Control and Oversight office to implement the program.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 371 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, the Under Secretary of Defense (USD(AT&amp;L)) designated a Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight to perform the duties of the DoD Corrosion Executive with responsibilities as described in the 2008 NDAA legislation.  A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.   In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development and producing individuals with corrosion expertise for the DoD corrosion control community of the future.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finish, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.

In FY 2009, the Military Departments assigned corrosion executives and began submitting reports to Congress on inserting corrosion planning into the acquisition process. The FY 2011 NDAA added a requirement for the DoD to report the amount of funds requested in the preceding year budget for each planned project or activity, as compared to the funding required for each project or activity.  These funds provide a portion of the funds used to implement associated corrosion control projects and activities.

These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 151 projects have been completed to date and 111 have resulted in new technology implementation.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 16:1.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisitions are accomplished in three categories including projects, research opportunities, and activities as described in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.

Projects are funded jointly by CPO and the Military Departments and are led by subject matter experts at the Military Department laboratories.  CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  CPO receives project plans and convenes an evaluation panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are also evaluated using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank projects by relative efficiency.  DEA factors include project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Research opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel chaired by the Deputy Director, CPO.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Activities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by CPO.  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Missile Defeat Project counters the growing global advancement and proliferation of road-mobile ballistic missile threats. The Missile Defeat Project coordinates and integrates Department of Defense and Intelligence Community efforts to develop counter-threat capability. The FY 2020 request will continue investments toward modernization of Time Sensitive Targeting Defeat capabilities identified in the 2018 National Defense Strategy for: 1) command, control, communications, computers and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; joint lethality in contested environments; and, missile defense efforts.  

In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017, the Missile Defeat Project transferred activities initiated under the Missile Defeat to other stakeholders starting in FY 2019.  In order to carry out the important effort initiated by Missile Defeat, the FY 2020 request will continue to create advanced capability for the defeat of time sensitive targets.  Activities will be coordinated with the Services, appropriate Agencies and the Combatant Commands to transition these developments into viable warfighting capabilities.  The Department is reviewing options to re-title this program element or transfer the remaining resources in to another program element to continuee work on time sensitive targets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) implements, maintains, and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy and places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  In FY 2019 funding for the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) hardware and software assurance and integrity analysis activities and Microelectronic Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC) activities were reallocated under Project 291 and Project 647, respectively. 

This PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities and the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency.

Recognizing that a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.  Its goal is to mitigate the Department of Defense (DoD)’s reliance on sole source foundries for trusted state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities implementing three integrated, complementary solutions that:  (1) protect the Intellectual Property (IP) of microelectronics components; (2) improve capabilities to evaluate and validate the trust and assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivise the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain; and (4) provide access to and leadership in advanced microelectronics that are vital to the national security and economic competitiveness for the USG in order to enable DoD and broader USG access to commercial SOTA microelectronics technology.

This activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.  This activity is conducted, in coordination with the JFAC Steering Committee and the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Advisory Board, by performers, such as the JFAC service providers, Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), and other DoD and Intelligence Community S&amp;T organizations and laboratories in the area of hardware assurance (HwA) and software assurance (SwA).  It is integrating with, and supporting, the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related HwA and SwA S&amp;T actions.  This activity is also expected to maintain and update the DoD long-term microelectronics strategy based on feedback from the execution of this PE and enable and leverage commercial and academic relationships as necessary to fulfill this mission.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The JFAC will provide capabilities for programs to keep assessment findings throughout the life cycle of their systems for data mining (e.g., documentation on rationale for previous mitigation decisions).  The collaboration between the JFAC and program offices will help mitigate existing and emerging critical threats and vulnerabilities in software available to all DoD programs. JFAC efforts will continue to maintain infrastructure services and staff for the Joint Federated Assurance Center-Coordination Center (JFAC-CC) for enabling the centralized assurance repository, software assurance contract language, software assurance metrics, the JFAC Ticketing System, software assurance tool license distribution, help-desk, and hard problem analysis. It will also provide for implementation of the science and technology portal at the JFAC website to make directly available to programs and organizations advanced technology solutions from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA), Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and other S&amp;T providers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of verifying the trust and assurance of parts and develops standards and practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification when DoD Trusted Foundry Program options are not available.  Core technical laboratories and other HwA and SwA capabilities are chartered as a JFAC to provide this support.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (&lt;45 nanometers (nm)), throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party IP contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities, in coordination with the JFAC, which prioritizes this investment as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for JFAC services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:
• Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. 
• Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts.
• Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments.

This project develops and matures assurance mitigations, evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, and system vulnerability assessments and testbeds.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs and supply chains and formal relationships with industry to foster commercial development of secure, trusted, and assured parts and for acquisition of USG access to proprietary designs, software, development, and quality assurance processes and test procedures to develop practices that minimize security flaws in designs and facilitate verification.  Two capability areas that are core to improved commercial designs will be improved, i.e., assured designs and supply chains.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom, secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the JFAC with regard to verification and validation of SOTA microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will develop innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted and assured strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also develops, demonstrates, and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risk associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project would also support using a repository of vetted third-party IP and electronic data automation (EDA) tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

This project initially received additional funding in FY 2019 to support Microelectronics Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC) efforts in the following focus areas:  capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronics.  In FY 2019, funding for those MINSEC activities was reallocated from Project Number 646 to Project Number 647.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

• Design-For-Trust techniques
• IP protection
• Low-volume SOTA manufacturing
• Electronic component markers
• Imaging technologies and forensics
• Computing infrastructure and processing methods.

Primary efforts will include reducing-to-practice technologies enabling trusted (1) design, (2) access, (3) component integrity and (4) IP protection. FY 2018 primary activities include development of these technologies, followed by transition of these capabilities to new programs in the following fiscal years under PE 0605294D8Z.

This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles, and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the DoD microelectronics strategy by ensuring the availability of and access to the advanced, assured microelectronics that are critical for DoD and national security systems.  It will support the development and delivery of tools to protect the intellectual property (IP) confidentiality and integrity for a broad range of systems and missions and will provide a path for the production of these articles.  It will allow the DoD to 1) maintain technological leadership and a secure domestic microelectronics ecosystem; 2) promote access to all necessary current and future semiconductor technologies, including design, fabrication, packaging, and testing, from a robust base of suppliers; 3) provide multiple options for programs and the defense industrial base to quickly upgrade microelectronic components; 4) create a competitive industrial base of microelectronics suppliers that can rapidly adjust to the dynamics of the industry including the initiation of modernization pilots with DoD programs and industry to deliver new capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) processors, co-development of advanced commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) programmable devices, and addressing select IP obsolescence risks; and 5) provide DoD’s captive specialty needs suppliers and dedicated facilities with cost-effective upgrade capabilities and resources so they can deliver advanced technologies.

This project supports a broader national strategy to focus resources, policies, and incentives to enhance current and next generation defense capability by 1) maintaining access to U. S. domestic production of state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology; 2) enhancing state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries in the U.S. to produce more advanced technologies to better serve low-volume customers in the aerospace and defense community; 3) investing in research and development (R&amp;D) for the next generation of microelectronics for new materials, devices, architectures, and designs in coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI); 4) promoting threat awareness, proactive protection, and supply chain security to ensure these investments continue to benefit the U.S.; 5) exploring incentives for market growth through dual-use technologies, piloting acquisition reforms, partnering with industry, and providing incentives for cooperative R&amp;D and trade; and (6) establishing innovation hub pilots with industry.

MINSEC activities are categorized into the following focus areas:  next generation disruptive R&amp;D; capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; COTS programmable integrated circuit (IC) co-development; microelectronics obsolescence and replacement; microelectronics-focused workforce development; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronic (OE) microelectronics.

This project has received funding in FY 2020 to support MINSEC efforts in the following focus areas: capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; RHBP and RHBD; and RF and OE microelectronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Rapid Prototyping Program (RPP) accelerates innovation through prototyping efforts in partnership with the Services and Defense Agencies that reduce risk, establish affordable and realistic requirements, and support timely development of fieldable prototypes demonstrated in an operational environment.  RPP addresses priorities identified by the National Defense Strategy, modernization focus areas of the Department of Defense (DoD), the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and Service-identified capability gaps and needs.  Overarching program goals include enhanced warfighter lethality, modernization of cross-cutting technology areas, and delivering capabilities more quickly than traditional acquisition.

RPP develops prototypes that deliver needed capabilities to address Service gaps, reduce technical and integration risk, and enable warfighter feedback to define and improve requirements for Service and Agency programs of record.  RPP project selection is guided by the National Defense Strategy, USD(R&amp;E) priorities, and key technology modernization areas including machine learning; directed energy, networked command, control, and communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), advanced autonomous systems, and, joint lethality.  RPP is also guided by the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and Service-identified gaps and needs.  RPP rapidly develops and fields cross-cutting, multi-Service prototype capabilities that can be demonstrated in an operational environment to inform Department of Defense and Service leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

DE weapons provide the warfighter with scalable, targeted, and precision engagement while minimizing collateral damage.  This focus area will prototype advanced technologies required to enable the broad employment of DE technologies across the joint force.  Example technologies include compact, efficient energy generation, energy storage, and thermal management technologies, high efficiency laser diodes, advanced manufacturing and fabrication techniques, and, robust beam control technologies.  Specific activities include effects testing to quantify target susceptibility to DE; development, testing, and optimization of DE subsystems; and, integration of weapon prototypes.  These prototyping activities will enable faster transition of DE technologies to the warfighter by reducing technical risk, informing joint force CONOPS, and demonstrating new warfighter capabilities enabled by DE.  A cross functional team, led by the OUSD(R&amp;E), will review and select prototyping proposals from across the Department of Defense in the year of execution.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>This is a new Program Element and new projects for DIU Prototyping and the National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) programs. 

Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016. Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was transferred from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) (PE 0603342D8W).  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY 2020, DIU funding transferred from WHS to OSD consistent with the realignment and establishment of USD(Research &amp; Engineering), and disestablishment of USD(Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DIU mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and Department of Defense (DoD) in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority. Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB)/Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.

The U.S. DoD relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict. The DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter. Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.

The DIU Prototyping program will find and provide access to technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.  Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.  DIU Prototyping funds will facilitate the award of projects that can augment commercial technologies, existing government-owned capabilities or concepts for defense application.  The National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) will fund the commercialization and scaling dual-use, hardware-based technologies that are critical to the military.  These technology areas are currently severely under-served by the private U.S. venture capital industry and often funded by strategic and persistent capital from China.  In FY 2020, NSIC plans to attract private capital to leverage investments in about 8-12 selected projects that include batteries, drones, and quantum sensors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>This is a new Program Element with two new Project Codes for DIU Prototyping/Project 843, $17.000 million, and National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC)/Project 844, $75.000 million programs.  For Project 843, FY 2020 $17.000 million was transferred from WHS O&amp;M 0901583D8W to RDT&amp;E, DW PE 0604341D8Z/843 DIU Prototyping.  Project 844 NSIC is a new program add. The overall increase of $92.000 million will fund prototype projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.  The DIU Prototyping and NSIC focus areas are complementary and we envision that this integration will not only save funds in the future, but more importantly, grow the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) by attracting new NSIB suppliers and improve the adoption of commercial technologies for the warfighter.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by WHS.  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the OUSD(R&amp;E).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>This is a new program element and new project 844 for the National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC).</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DIUx mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by WHS.   In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the OUSD(R&amp;E).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY 2020, DIU funding will transfer from WHS to OSD consistent with the functional realignment to OUSD(R&amp;E). 

The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and DoD in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority.  Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 OMB/OSTP research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.

The National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) will fund the commercialization and scaling dual-use, hardware-based technologies that are critical to the military. These technology areas are currently severely under-served by the private U.S. venture capital industry and often funded by strategic and persistent capital from China.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) will fund the commercialization and scaling dual-use, hardware-based technologies that are critical to the military.  These technology areas are currently severely underserved by the private U.S. venture capital industry and often funded by strategic and persistent capital from China.  NSIC will attract private capital to leverage DoD investments in select priority projects that include batteries, drones, and quantum sensors.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Unmanned Systems (UxS) Common Development program is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address unmanned systems’ issues across all domains and all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across all unmanned systems.  This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), to include integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards.

Focus on safe and secure integration into the National Airspace, which includes GBSAA, ABSAA, and Unmanned Traffic Management interoperability and standards</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk and Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see-and-avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within US and foreign national airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood, Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system will provide a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national Airspace.  The change in airspace procedures, Airspace de-confliction and Traffic Management requires new processes and procedures for safe and secure national airspace access.  
 
This joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JAIC was established to preserve and expand our military advantage in support of the Department’s 2018 National Defense Strategy. As a primarily executing body it will accelerate the delivery of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities, scale the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize DoD AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages.  The JAIC mission is to accelerate the delivery of AI to achieve impact scaled across the DoD at relevant speed to transform the DoD and ensure the nation maintains a competitive advantage.  JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven’s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. The JAIC will adopt or adapt commercial and government developed capabilities to improve warfighting and business processes. 

JAIC will execute an initial sequence of AI implementations, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI), to demonstrate value and create momentum. NMIs are high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include government, commercial, and academic partners to prototype and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.

JAIC will scale use cases throughout the DoD in a manner that aligns with and leverages DoD enterprise cloud computing. It will establish a common foundation for scaling AI’s impact across DoD, including shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, and cloud and edge services. This will drive greater value by enabling consistency of approach, technology, and tools for all delivery-focused AI projects.
JAIC will foster shared lessons, and establish an enterprise approach while catalyzing efforts across DoD to enable more rapid and efficient prototyping and delivery of AI capabilities. JAIC will develop a governance framework and standards for AI development and delivery and collaborate within DoD, across government, and with industry, academia, and U.S. allies to strengthen partnerships, highlight critical needs, solve problems of urgent operational significance, and adapt AI technologies for DoD missions.

JAIC develops, tests, prototypes and demonstrates innovative AI, Machine Learning (ML), data infrastructure, and model/algorithm test and assessment capabilities to integrate AI capabilities across numerous domains and technical areas including maintenance and supply chain, personnel recovery, infrastructure assessment, geospatial monitoring during disaster, and cyber sense making. JAIC develops and evaluates integrated prototype technologies in realistic operating environments with DoD entities to assess the performance or cost reduction potential of applying such advanced technology to scale across multiple services.  JAIC does this by aligning rapid prototype projects under NMIs and leverages existing commercial technology for DoD use, built upon a common architecture that enables the DoD to rapidly scale AI capability.  

For the Predictive Maintenance NMI, JAIC uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics to forecast major issues on the H-60 helicopter platform to better enable services to respond to upcoming failure. AI/ML will help identify component failure relationships to principle end items to predict critical failure prior to corrective maintenance and reactive supply chain requisitions. This will increase efficiency, decrease fleet operating and sustainment costs for equipment platforms, and reduce the time and costs associated with repair part requisition, management and transportation. Predictive maintenance will increase fleet operational readiness through reduced deadline or degradation time, particularly by preventing critical failure during missions, thereby providing certainty for availability and tasking to combatant commands and Joint Forces. This NMI will also apply AI and ML to optimize positioning of tools, parts, and personnel to provide the Joint Force with the best location to provide efficient and cost-effective repair and supply depots.

For the Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief NMI, JAIC will use computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and identify distressed or missing personnel, predict forest fire patterns and burn rates, and flooding that impact human life and infrastructure. JAIC does this within FMV images (e.g., person, forest fire lines, flood lines, terrain and infrastructure changes) and other AI algorithms for text based projects to coordinate disaster relief efforts. JAIC algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from multiple intelligence sources.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 4, Demonstration and Validation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                        <r2:Text>JAIC will use rapid prototype sprints to field increasing predictive maintenance capability for the H-60 helicopter fleet across the Joint Force. JAIC will use data aggregation, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics algorithms to detect, correlate, and predict component failure and optimize supply chain solutions. This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive algorithms into the maintenance and supply business processes of H-60 fleet management, utilizing Joint Force readiness and supply data to process at machine speed versus human speed. 
JAIC will also use rapid prototype sprints to field capability to the Joint Force that enables better response to natural disasters, particularly those caused by wildfires and flooding, both common worldwide. Computer vision and algorithms will not only reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data, but provide insights and capability that humans alone currently do not have the capacity to manage. JAIC will develop algorithms focused on ISR and geospatial data to develop baseline GEOINT and infrastructure, then analyze changes to that baseline to best provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. This will aid in the more efficient, effective, and quick recovery of distressed humans, identify damage to infrastructure, and assist relief efforts or evacuation and aid response. Overall, this effort will reduce risk to human life, critical infrastructure, and improve U.S. response in times of regional or global crises. This effort will integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for predictive algorithms, computer vision to identify critical information requirements, and user alerts.
The JAIC will create a Joint Common Foundation (JCF) platform that will be crucial to the development, testing, and fielding of AI capabilities to the Department. This JCF will contain shared common components providing NMIs/CMIs and the Department with the packages, frameworks, software, tools necessary to accelerate the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities. This includes the build out of AI platforms in a secure protected enclave hosted in a multi-cloud/multi-domain environment which provides NMIs/CMIs with compute, storage and security.
The JCF platform supports scalable delivery of novel, impactful AI capability across DoD through the use of several key infrastructure elements. This infrastructure/environment will support each stage of the applied AI lifecycle, including: prototyping, integration, scaling, and support. The common foundation includes shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, in addition to cloud and edge services.  As the JAIC scales and the common foundation develops, entities across DOD will be able to both use and contribute to the infrastructure, leveraging the “factory” of artifacts. This will be done in collaboration with industry and government partners, including technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and across the Department.
The JCF platform will promote information sharing and integration with Programs of Record by facilitating rapid deployment of AI capabilities into operational environments, military platforms and IT systems.  JAIC will establish its Tier 2 (Mission/Business Processes) and Tier 3 (IS and PIT Systems)  RMF governance structure to comply with DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT) and DoDI 8500.01,  Cybersecurity. JAIC will appoint in writing officials to an organization CIO (Tier 2 position) and Authorizing Official (AO) and Authorizing Official Designated Representative (AODR) (Tier 3 positions) to meet the intend of DoD and OMB guidance.</r2:Text>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE) by funding activities that help CAPE to implement the Department's intent to reinvigorate wargaming.  CAPE accomplishes this by leading wargaming activities, developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames. This was a new start program in FY 2017. 
This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  

These RDT&amp;E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  
The research agenda focuses on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the vision of the Deputy Secretary of Defense to reinvigorate wargaming in the Department of Defense.  CAPE will accomplish this by leading wargaming activities; developing and managing the Wargaming Portal, and supporting the design, execution, and analysis of wargames.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments from wargaming excursions.  Outcomes include the compilation and analysis of wargaming data in the Wargaming Portal and support for data use by wargaming participants.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) Program was established in Section 1073 of the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and authorized as a permanent program in the FY 2017 NDAA.  The RIF Program accelerates the fielding of innovative technologies into military systems via a competitive, merit-based selection process.  Technology innovations are drawn from Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, defense laboratory and academia efforts, and other innovative technologies, including dual-use and Independent Research &amp; Development (IRAD) technologies.  Projects stimulate innovation, mitigate technical risks, reduce acquisition and/or lifecycle costs, improve test outcomes, and rapidly insert technology into major acquisition programs and other programs that meet critical national security needs.  RIF provides a mechanism for bridging the “Valley of Death” by funding the integration work vital to transition technologies out of the laboratory and into Programs of Record.  Since inception, RIF has evaluated over 18,000 industry submitted white papers and funded over 800 projects with companies from 43 different states across the 30 different organizations in the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other Defense Agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

RIF funds are distributed evenly between the Services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and the other Defense agencies.  RIF is executed via a competitive two-step process for participation in the program.  Industry is invited to submit three-page white papers plus a quad chart through an annual Broad Agency Announcement.  Once white papers have been reviewed, the highest ranking white papers are invited to submit full detailed proposals for funding consideration.  In ranking white papers, preference will be given to projects focusing on the Research and Engineering top 10 research priorities, the National Defense Strategy, and small businesses.  Full proposals are subject to final review and the highest ranking proposals are selected for contract award.  The statute for RIF defines project scope as not to exceed 24 months and $3.000 million per project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY2019 funding request was reduced by $3.461 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances with payback in FY20 &amp; FY21.

Please note:  FY 2018 funding, within internal financial system, was erroneously combined within project code 163 ($12.320) versus the proper breakout between project codes 163 ($7.223) and 042 ($5.097).  The internal system cannot be changed at this time preventing us from reporting the actual cost breakdown.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development throughout DoD for an integrated and systemic RDT&amp;E approach for countering nuclear threats and nuclear and conventional physical security technology and systems.  The funding has been centralized in this Defense-wide PE since the early 1990s and represents a substantial portion of all DoD physical security RDT&amp;E funding.  Priorities for this PE RDT&amp;E efforts are driven by inputs from Quadrennial Defense Review guidance, Combatant Command and Service requirements, analysis reports such as “Protecting the Force:  Lessons from Fort Hood,” January 2010, the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection Cost Benefits Analysis, Multi-national Work Plans established through the Nuclear Security Summit process, and DoD Directive 5210.41, Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons-directed requirements and associated security deviation reports.  

Under this integrated approach, funds are used to provide system development and demonstration for the Department in seven capability areas:  (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support. The program will develop systems that are producible, supportable, and affordable and to demonstrate system integration, interoperability, and utility prior to full-rate production.  The projects under the PE become technology insertions into existing programs or advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The PE initiatives are coordinated by the Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group.  This group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort and when applicable ensure systems integration and promote interoperability and sustainability.  

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Radiological Detection System will provide a ruggedized Radiation Detection, Indication, and Computation for real time gamma radiation monitoring and low energy x-ray, beta, alpha, and neutron detection.

The Joint Personal Dosimeter will provide a joint solution to increase capability and reduce life-cycle costs.

Both systems will address Operation TOMODACHI (response to Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant incident) lessons learned for common, interoperable equipment with adequate sensitivity and common units of measure.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) was established to develop and demonstrate technologies and applications that advance conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) warfighting capabilities.  The program uses a national team with participation from the Services, Agencies, national research laboratories, and further involvement of competitive industry.  Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.

The hypersonic Prompt Global Strike Capability Development Program Element supports the National Defense Strategy's focus on technological advancements that enhance deterrence and increase strategic flexibility, freedom of action, and Joint Force lethality.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Program emphasis is on demonstrating component and subsystem technology maturity with risk reduction initiatives highlighted by flight tests.  The program funds the design, development, and experimentation of boosters, payload delivery vehicles (PDVs), non-nuclear warheads, thermal protection systems, guidance systems, test range modernization, and mission planning and enabling capabilities.  To support these development activities, the program procures modeling and simulation capabilities, ground testing, command and control interfaces, test range support, and launch system infrastructure.  Additionally, expert resources address strategic policy and treaty issues.  Program timing will be driven by the outcome of flight and ground test events as well as DoD budgets.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>This sub-project will test and evaluate alternative booster and delivery vehicle options and will assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the CPGS capability gap.  It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid over flight issues; and controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Description and Budget Item Justification: The Joint Tactical Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS) program supports collaborative efforts to achieve strategy-driven capability development spanning the suite of Department enablers and programs to include Communications and Networks, Cyber, Command and Control (C2), space, Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3), and technology within the Assistant Secretary of Defense Acquisition Portfolio.  JTIDS also supports matters relating to acquisition and the integration and protection of technology that enable capability for the warfighter, including cross-cutting functional capabilities that advance the acquisition enterprise, drive innovative acquisition approaches, policy, acquisition management, advanced software acquisition, and business/financial management. These efforts include conducting mission informed capability-based analysis; portfolio assessments to include analyzing modernization trends that result in the development of roadmaps or business area strategies that support balanced investment decisions; and monitoring and assessing Major Defense Acquisition Programs(MDAPs) , Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS), and defense Business Systems in a capability portfolio context. Activities in the JTIDS include (1) mission informed capability-based analysis; (2) Interoperability &amp; Integration; (3) roadmap development and support to business area strategies; and (4) support tools and guidance; (5) Innovative Acquisition Approaches, (6) Software acquisition, and (7) advanced acquisition software and software provenance. JTIDS also enables cross-department collaboration to enable enterprise-wide approaches.   JTIDS also enables cross-department collaboration to enable enterprise-wide approaches. This includes: (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) engaging in a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, policy, management and execution levels. JTIDS is focused on capabilities-based portfolio management of the Department's key enablers, thus there are many shared equities with in ASD(A) and across OSD. To fully meet mission need the JTIDS program supports extensive collaboration with required alliances and with other OSD PSA's.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The CIMB was established in 2012 in response to the FY2011 NDAA Section 933, where DoD was directed to provide a strategy for the rapid acquisition of cyber capabilities, for cyber warfare for USCC and the Cyber Service components of the military departments. USD(A&amp;S) is responsible for compliance with the FY2011 NDAA and Chairs the CIMB. Funds provide technical, systems engineering, trend analysis, and portfolio management of programs, projects and activities developing cyber capabilities to maximize the Department's return on investment of cyberspace resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing, procuring, and sustaining critical cyber capabilities and cyber resilient systems and platforms from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of weapons systems performance and military operations. Additionally, these funds will provide systems analyses, portfolio management, executive support of CIMB, enterprise wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to Cyber capabilities and ensuring cyber resilience within systems and platforms. Resources will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance, cost parameters, determining and mitigating cyber risks of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to assure capability advantage, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts, minimize cyber related performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex systems, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions and address cyber security requirements, gaps and required technical solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The increase in funds for the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program for FY20-24 reflects Department of Defense commitments to expand the application of exportability activities in acquisition programs, activities which  closely align with the three priority lines of effort outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy: 1) increasing lethality, by building technology protection features into U.S. defense systems to maintain the U.S. competitive military edge; 2) strengthening alliances and partnerships, by deepening interoperability with coalition partners; and 3) improving business practices, by helping decrease costs for the DoD and foreign partners via greater economies of scale. By facilitating the export of U.S. defense systems, the DoD enhances the U.S. defense industrial base, strengthens the military capabilities of U.S. allies around the world, and increases coalition interoperability.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export, and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs.  Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance.  Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities.

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in United States Government/DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise due to ad-hoc sales later in production.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends, and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

By facilitating the export of U.S. defense systems, the DoD enhances the U.S. defense industrial base, strengthens the military capabilities of U.S. allies around the world, and increases coalition interoperability.</r2:Remarks>

+$8.134 million is required to support Next Generation Resource Management Systems.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).
  
NEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) is responsible for advising the Secretary of Defense on all Defense budgetary and fiscal matters, for Defense budget development and execution, and for overseeing financial management across the Department. The OUSD(C) has a broad set of responsibilities in supporting the Planning, Programing, Budget and Execution (PPBE) process. The Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), provides independent analytic advice to the Secretary of Defense on all aspects of the Defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of program and defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems. 
There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements.  The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

OUSD(C) and CAPE use multiple systems to formulate, justify, distribute, and execute DoD budgets. The information managed by the budget formulation and programming systems is redundant, and reconciliation of information is difficult and inefficient. These systems require extensive manpower investments to give executives the information they need to make key financial decisions in a timely manner.

The OUSD(C) and CAPE require a more efficient, effective Defense budget environment that optimizes the budget cycle to ensure users are processing and reporting efficiently and DoD Senior Leadership has the information to make informed, critical decisions. 

The OUSD(C) requires capabilities that shall provide for the effective formulation, and justification of the Defense budget. The requirement is for:
• Automated exchange and reconciliation of budget data
• Improved efficiency through the utilization of a unified budgetary model
• Instantaneous ability to generate data for management reviews and decisions
• Capability to accommodate emerging business practices

Moving forward, the new “to be” system shall be designed as a single system with a unified data source for OUSD(C) and CAPE. The new system shall provide a single, integrated system that employs the latest technologies to fulfill the Department’s financial management responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The new system shall provide twenty-first century information technology that shall allow users to view information from multiple fully integrated modules simultaneously, e.g., current year budget submission, decision documents from previous years, and budget execution information.  

DEFENSE REPOSITORY FOR COMMON ENTERPRISE DATA:

Defense Repository for Common Enterprise data (DRCED) support financial audit, cost management, performance management, and readiness.

The DoD DRCED requires:
• All supporting Department data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)
• Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)
• Ability to extract subset populations
• Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT

The failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.

To achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (DRCED).  This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD’s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard business and readiness data.  Both an application and analytical platform, the DRCED leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete DRCED.  

The first phase of DRCED implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration.  When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act. The proof of concept was successful and the program moved to an operations phase in FY18.

DRCED is a joint effort between Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO), Office of the Chief Management Officer (ODCMO), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), USSOCOM, and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).

FY19 develops and implements a SIPR environment for Cost Accounting Framework to meet Operations Security (OPSEC) and Information Security (INFOSEC) requirements

FY20 continues the development of a common enterprise data repository to aggregate and fuse multiple data sources to make business and analytical decisions, find data inconsistencies and improve financial audits across the DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                            <r2:Text>After the NGRMS program funding was transferred from DLA to OUSD(C) in FY2017, the Comptroller staff has begun work on developing a comprehensive, integrated plan as part of acquisition planning activities that will describe the business, technical, and support strategies to manage program risks and meet program objectives.  OUSD(C) has taken the first step in getting the program back on track.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are working on a joint spiral development effort to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the DoD budget formulation process by consolidating multiple budget data collection points into a prototype for programming and budget data.  This would combine the collection of data performed by the existing applications Standard Data Collection System (SDCS) (Manpower, Forces, Pay Rates, DWCF), Comptroller Information System (CIS), Program Resources Collection Process (PRCP) (Procurement, Research Development Test &amp; Development, Military Construction and Procurement) and the Comptroller Information System (CIS).  This serves as an important proof-of-concept for future development of NGRMS.  Certain elements of agile development and the waterfall method are applied to provide incremental, staged improvements in functionality.

The prototype will provide a single, centralized user interface for the DoD components and agencies to submit their budget requests using a common, integrated budget structure, improving efficiency and effectiveness by removing redundancy and need for data reconciliation across multiple budget systems.  This initial phase will support capabilities to collect and feed the budget request data back to existing Comptroller and CAPE legacy systems (CIS, PRCP, and SDCS) to be further processed as part of the President's Budget submission process.  This effort is intended to expand into the next development phase of the NGRMS.

To prove the concept, OUSD(C) and CAPE have begun to capture and process Manpower (Military End Strength and Civilian FTEs) data.  The purpose of this prototype is to prove that budget submission data can be captured with a commonly defined data structure, transformed, and exchanged back to CIS, PRCP and SDCS in a seamless manner.  OUSD(C) and CAPE are currently working to define a standard set of submission data elements for collection of Manpower data.  The single submission prototype effort is intended to expand to include capture of all budget transaction types and will lead to NGRMS, the modernization and consolidation of multiple budget systems, implementation of next generation capabilities, and eventually, retirement of multiple legacy systems.</r2:Text>

All DoD organizations are pursuing the current statutory goal of achieving the state of audit that supports entry into a full financial statement of audit in FY 2018 with an initial opinion rendered in mid-FY 2019.  Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law. 

The requested funds will be used to buy “Big Data” software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT requirement. 
This funds include subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor.  This will not result in hiring additional government personnel. 

The UoT will have the capability to:
•	Ingest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems
•	Normalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture
•	Reconcile transactional details to summary financial data
•	Provide auditor’s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions
•	Business Analytics/Reporting
•	DATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017
•	Provide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data

This effort will expand in scope to support other enterprise analytics efforts like cost management, performance management, and readiness.  The scope is to bring in data from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit readiness and other analytical use cases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>Section 2222 of Title 10, USC required that a single Business Mission Area (BMA) Investment Review Board (IRB) be established. As part of the stand-up of this single IRB, Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) and DoD Components are charged with specifying and delivering required business outcomes for the Department. These business outcomes are then incorporated into the architecture and data products making up the Department's Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), under the oversight and direction of the Defense Business Council. These metrics measure the incorporation of the Component identified business outcomes and associated component organizational alignments into the BEA.
•	FY 2018 Goal: 100% of BEA discoverable data artifacts transitioned to a government cloud based information environment. (*Partially Met)
•	FY 2019 Goal: 30% of business outcomes and Business Capability Acquisition Cycle performance data incorporated into the BEA. This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision making.
•	FY 2020 Goal: 75% of business outcomes and Business Capability Acquisition Cycle performance data incorporated into the BEA. This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision

Section 2222 of Title 10, USC further required that the defense business enterprise architecture include an information infrastructure to enable the producing of timely accurate and reliable business information.  This metric measures the discoverability of BEA content that supports DoD decision making.

•	FY 2018 Goal: 100% of BEA data artifacts are discoverable via web services. (*Partially Met)
•	FY 2019 Goal: 100% of BEA discoverable data artifacts transitioned to a government cloud based information environment.
•	FY 2020 Goal: 60% of defense business system investment and portfolio analytical products leverage the BEA cloud based information environment</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding for the Microelectronic Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC) activities were re-aligned from Project Number 809 to Project Number 822.

This Program Element (PE) supports activities to ensure critical and sensitive integrated circuits are available to meet the DoD’s needs.  It refines strategies and management planning activities that will: (1) provide support to acquisition programs to address trusted and assured microelectronics supply needs; (2) improve capability to evaluate and validate assurance of microelectronic parts and advance standards to incentivize the commercial marketplace to recognize hardware assurance as a competitive design standard; (3) develop and demonstrate alternative approaches to the DoD Trusted Foundry program to assure the microelectronics supply chain; and (4) provide access to advanced microelectronics that are vital to the national security and economic competitiveness for the U.S. government (USG) in order to enable DoD and broader USG access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics technology.

This PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities and the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency.

This activity will be coordinated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and will include performers from the DoD Components, the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA), other DoD and Intelligence Community science and technology (S&amp;T) organizations and laboratories, the defense industry, and the broader commercial industrial base.  It will integrate the functions of the DoD Trusted Foundry Program, the Trusted Supplier accreditation program, JFAC, and related science and technology (S&amp;T) activities.  

This activity implements, maintains, and updates the DoD’s long-term microelectronics strategy.  Additionally this activity places emphasis on incentivizing and proving new microelectronics technology solutions.  Recognizing that  ensured access to a trusted and assured supply of microelectronics is a USG-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop and demonstrate the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies, while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted, strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing and independent verification and validation of commercial designs.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in trusted environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and electronic design automation (EDA) tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These activities will mature and evaluate trust technologies and techniques through efforts that may include the conduct of studies, Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) and other efforts to coordinate research programs across USG research and development (R&amp;D) organizations, academia and industry.

This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the DoD microelectronics strategy by ensuring the availability of and access to the advanced, assured microelectronics that are critical for DoD and national security systems.  It will support the development and delivery of tools to protect the intellectual property (IP) confidentiality and integrity for a broad range of systems and missions and will provide a path for the production of these articles.  It will allow the DoD to 1) maintain technological leadership and a secure domestic microelectronics ecosystem; 2) promote access to all necessary current and future semiconductor technologies, including design, fabrication, packaging, and testing, from a robust base of suppliers; 3) provide multiple options for programs and the Defense Industrial Base to quickly upgrade microelectronic components; 4) create a competitive industrial base of microelectronics suppliers that can rapidly adjust to the dynamics of the industry including the initiation of modernization pilots with DoD programs and industry to deliver new capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) processors, co-development of advanced commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) programmable devices, and addressing select IP obsolescence risks; and 5) provide DoD’s captive specialty needs suppliers and dedicated facilities with cost-effective upgrade capabilities and resources so they can deliver advanced technologies.

This project supports a broader national strategy to focus resources, policies, and incentives to enhance current and next generation defense capability by 1) maintaining access to U.S. domestic production of state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology; 2) enhancing state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries in the U.S. to produce more advanced technologies to better serve low-volume customers in the aerospace and defense community; 3) investing in research and development (R&amp;D) for the next generation of microelectronics for new materials, devices, architectures, and designs in coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI); 4) promoting threat awareness, proactive protection, and supply chain security to ensure these investments continue to benefit the U.S.; and 5) exploring incentives for market growth through dual-use technologies, piloting acquisition reforms and providing incentives for cooperative R&amp;D and trade.

MINSEC activities are categorized into the following focus areas:  next generation disruptive R&amp;D; capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development, demonstration, and capability insertion; COTS programmable integrated circuit (IC) co-development; microelectronics obsolescence and replacement; microelectronics-focused workforce development; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronic (OE) microelectronics.

This project received additional funding in FY 2019 to support MINSEC efforts in the COTS programmable IC co-development focus area. FY 2020 funding for this project will continue the ongoing FY 2019 MINSEC COTS programmable IC co-development activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0305304D8Z was established in FY2013 and plays a pivotal role in the Department’s ability to achieve audit readiness, enhance the Department’s goal of energy efficiency, gain a full accountability of Real Property assets, as well as improve data quality and integration across the full spectrum of EI&amp;E business functions.  The PE helped conduct a full Business Process Re-engineering of the processes used to collect energy information, and publishing an EEIM data standard and an additional effort to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD EI&amp;E Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements by supporting management and oversight of reconciliation efforts and auditability by determining requirements for the department's Real Property inventory records and asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this capability is an enterprise EI&amp;E Data Analytics &amp; Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with an independent verification &amp; validation capability. With access to real time data through services WSDLS, reports generated through business intelligence provide immediate indicators driving improved and quicker decisions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A key part of DoD’s strategy to meet its energy goals is to develop an energy information management environment that will enable the Services and OSD to track energy production and usage across the real property portfolio.  Information on energy usage is critical for day-to-day management and accountability, troubleshooting building systems, and planning for capital investments.  Integration with accurate Real property asset, Utilization, Military Construction, Environmental, and installation Geospatial data is equally key to ensuring these decisions for planning and reporting are possible.  It also supports development of The geospatial portal for visualizing energy layers with other EI&amp;E data on installation or area maps for improved spatial analysis.  This portal is the DOD aggregated repository for DoD Common Installation Picture layers.  Additionally, the map viewer is customized and easier for OSD senior staff to manipulate and includes an online catalog of maps, documents and data; and a secure, robust data exchange module. This development supports a range of Joint Staff and OSD customers.  Since this effort is being accomplished through similar contract and vendors as PCode 305, funding was moved to 305 to facilitate simpler contract Purchase Request actions with fewer lines of accounting.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Real Property Inventory fulfills requirements of Executive Order for DoD to achieve and maintain real property accountability.  This is critical both from audit readiness and program management perspectives.  This funding provides the department independent verification and validation needed to reconcile errors to gain the data quality and interoperability needed for decisionable data and processes throughout the lifecycle of real property assets. Oversight and configuration management of business rules and standards are used to determine requirements for the departments Real Property inventory records and proper end to end process steps throughout the lifecycle of an asset from purchase to disposal.  This includes development and procurement of the enterprise data warehouse for integrating existing and future EI&amp;E systems and database needs.  The Real Property Unique Identifier (RPUID) process has also been included in this EI&amp;E enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

No Clearinghouse funding in FY18. The current state of cyber security of energy-related (and other real property-related) control systems (such as the electronic/computer controls on heating, ventilation &amp; air conditioning equipment) is deficient, and the adjusted EEIM baseline supports a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative to address these issues.  Continue to support multiyear real property-related controls systems cyber security risk assessments and development of guidelines and training manuals for future in house procedures.  Also supports joint initiative with DOE this year.</r2:Text>

This effort supports a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative to address these issues.  So far it has generated an updated DoD CIO RMF Knowledge Service Portal with controls systems cyber security implementation guidance for practitioners (templates, key references, step-by-step instructions, look-up tables, etc.)
Controls systems cyber security Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPS) has transitioned from Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems (J-BASICS).  The department has begun to implement Platform Resilience Mission Assurance (PRMA) assessments across 10 installations.
This effort has also generated policy direction to Services and Agencies including a draft Department of Defense Instruction, a draft Department of Defense Manual and Security Handling Guide for data representing energy systems.</r2:Description>

Decrease due to budget decision which rephases 19 funds to FY20-21.  Fund at highest level possible since it is CYBERCOM funding provided for specific Cyber Security risks assessments and mitigation actions for facility related controls systems managed in the EI&amp;E business line.
Decrease in budget will significantly impact ability of program to meet its stated goal. At current levels of funding, up to half of installations scheduled and coordinated to be evaluated under the PRMA program will be canceled. There will not be enough data collected to complete FY18 and beyond goals for the establishment of department and enterprise wide cybersecurity solutions and methodologies.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. The CWMD Systems program supports the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This Program Element (PE) funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This project funds engineering and manufacturing development of CWMD systems, components, technologies, and/or applications, including system development and demonstration, and initial operational test and evaluation.  The purpose is to develop, build, and test systems, verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met, and support product development decisions.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Strategic, (DRRS-S,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS-S hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

The transformation of readiness reporting into a new, more comprehensive system under DRRS, presents a number of significant challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a mission/capabilities based reporting system oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS) makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  The need for these applications and the underlying data are a top priority for the DRRS project.

Consistent with Congressional guidance, the service-specific readiness systems are being integrated within DRRS-S while the system is undergoing further reform to better portray the Departments’ ability to meet the National Defense Strategy and fully implement the highly complex data structures and visualization tools needed to support the Global Force Management - Data Initiative, critical to the consumers of readiness information.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding supports Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) directing the Department of Defense (DoD) components to develop guidelines and procedures for a comprehensive readiness reporting system that evaluates readiness on the basis of the actual missions and capabilities assigned to the forces. The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for the DoD.  This system is being designed to measure the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  DRRS hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

DRRS expands the scope of readiness reporting within the Department to create a more comprehensive assessment of the total force and its capability to perform the tasks and missions required of it to support the National Military Strategy.  DRRS allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on our integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  The program is the keystone for the readiness enterprise and architected to embrace the implementation of the Global Force Management - Data Imitative (GFM-DI), allowing for the Department’s efforts in the realm of Adaptive Planning and Execution to be fully supported.

The realization of DRRS requires integrating a host of key technologies in order to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal is the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  This system is based on intelligent agents, dynamic databases, semantic middleware, and publish/subscribe concepts; providing a logically uniform view into the multiple databases and information sources that feed DRRS.  Through this type of advanced information environment, the DRRS dramatically expands the range of readiness information available to manage the force.  This environment supports a suite of analysis tools that allow users to explore the consequences of readiness deficiencies in terms of the ability to generate forces and assess transportation feasibility as it pertains to specific scenarios. These tools and tool suites harness the power of the information environment to make possible the kind of quick-turnaround, excursion-driven readiness assessment that is at the heart of DRRS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches. This means:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this direction, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Departments 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches.  This meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element (PE) has been used to fund the development of critically needed, high-priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements. The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts, and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities. CTEIP focuses investments on projects that will have high productivity returns on investment. Projects under the CTEIP PE support two basic tasks: investments to improve and develop the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Projects (REP)).

The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major functional areas of air combat; autonomy; armament and munitions; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) networks; common range instrumentation; directed energy; electronic combat; cyber warfare; land combat; sea combat; space combat; strategic warfare, target systems; and test environments. Examples of project subject matter include infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, electronic warfare test capability developments to address critical testing shortfalls against advanced threats, long range airborne telemetry, threat simulator development, mobile optical tracking, nuclear survivability, and unmanned and autonomous systems. CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges. 

CTEIP has provided special focus to institutionalize the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) as a practical test tool, to link ranges to enhance inter-range and inter-Service cooperation and resource sharing, and to ensure development and acquisition of common instrumentation necessary for a more efficient test infrastructure.

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs. These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness, short timelines between system design maturity and scheduled OT, and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing. Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.

This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, project improvements, quick reaction efforts, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure, and supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD component weapon system test requirements.

The FY2020 CTEIP budget is described in detail below. The FY2020 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments and increased investments for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program provides a Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise-wide test capability to support system-to-system interoperability testing, mission-level environment testing, and cyber event operations, including cyber testing, cyber training, cyber experimentation, and cyber mission rehearsal.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  The JMETC program provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that supports system development to measure and improve interoperability performance and cyber resiliency, which otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because it provides test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs.  By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, the JMETC program allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JMETC distributed test mission is to provide the persistent and reusable enterprise T&amp;E infrastructure necessary for effectively conducting Joint, interoperability, and system integration RDT&amp;E on DoD warfighting capabilities.  Building the required agile, multi-organizational test infrastructure to assess system-to-system interoperability, effectiveness, and resiliency is cost prohibitive for any single acquisition program.  The JMETC Distributed Test capability reduces the cost to plan, setup, and execute these complex tests by delivering an enterprise-wide capability that incorporates persistent connectivity, common integration software for linking sites and live-virtual-constructive (LVC) test resources, accredited test tools, cybersecurity support, and distributed T&amp;E expertise into a robust, operationally representative T&amp;E mission environment.  The JMETC Distributed Test project also provides its customers a support team to assist with JMETC capabilities and the execution of distributed test events.  The JMETC Distributed Test project has also begun the task of modernizing DoD T&amp;E knowledge management by introducing big data analytics tools and techniques as part of its enterprise capabilities.  The JMETC Distributed Test project builds, maintains, and operates the JMETC infrastructure and pays for persistent availability of national connectivity for testing; data communications middleware; development of interface standards; common software tools and components; and a reuse repository.  The JMETC Distributed Test project also provides program management, facilities, equipment, operating costs, and special studies and analysis related to distributed test capabilities and infrastructure.  Ultimately, the JMETC Distributed Test project supports and advances experimentation, system engineering, acquisition, testing, training, and mission planning, aligned to the National Defense Strategy to build a more lethal force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) is comprised of cyber ranges and a secure distributed network infrastructure to service the cyber range user community.  The NCRC currently consists of five functional cyber ranges, including the National Cyber Range in Florida as well as four Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDP) located in Hawaii, Alabama, Maryland, and Massachusetts.  To enhance DoD cyber range test and training capability and capacity, the NCRC is being expanded with additional cyber ranges co-located with key Service organizations to support an increase of cyber testing of DoD systems as well as training of cyber warfighters.  The JMETC Multiple Independent Level of Security (MILS) Network (JMN) currently links 58 sites across the DoD, industry, and academia, providing secure access between cyber ranges, laboratories, and facilities.  Both the cyber ranges and the network infrastructure are accredited to support multiple levels of security classifications, specifically configured to meet particular cyber event requirements.  The NCRC investments have been aligned to support the National Defense Strategy in improving cyber defense, cyber resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations.

The NCRC conducts cyberspace test and training events for the full spectrum of DoD customers including research, development, acquisition, testing, training and operational Cyber Mission Forces (CMF).  The NCRC executes wide variety of event types including science and technology (S&amp;T) demonstrations, developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E), operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E), security controls assessments, cyberspace operations training, refinement of cyberspace tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) Development, forensics/malware analysis) and cyberspace operations mission rehearsal.  The NCRC enables acquisition programs to conduct cybersecurity test and evaluation in an operationally representative cyberspace environment enabling identification, validation and mitigation of vulnerabilities.  The NCRC also supports training, mission rehearsal and certification of the CMF in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.

The NCRC provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission-representative friendly, neutral, and adversarial cyberspace environments.  
The NCRC also facilitates integration of distributed organizations with different missions and workforce relevant to cyber operations (e.g., cyber operators, penetrations testers, cyber assessors, cyber observers, cyber analysts, etc.).  The NCRC supports cyber activities across of a full spectrum of DoD systems, including weapon platforms, C4I systems, business systems, network devices, and other systems vulnerable to a cyber-attack.  The NCRC extensively utilizes automation to minimize human error, to reduce the time required to set-up for a cyber event, and to ensure repeatable results.  In addition, the NCRC employs post-event sanitization techniques on all assets after exposure to malicious code to restore back to a known, clean state, which allows for reuse in future events.  

The NCRC has a multidisciplinary workforce with software, systems, network, virtualization, automation, system administration, and cybersecurity subject matter expertise.  In support of successful planning and execution of hosted events, the NCRC workforce helps users define and refine their event objectives, assists with identifying and prioritizing potential vulnerabilities, designs virtualized cyber environments, develops customized traffic generation and instrumentation solutions, integrates 3rd party hardware and software, executes cyber events on behalf of the user, provides cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments, performs detailed cyber analysis, and delivers detailed reports on the results.  In addition, the NCRC workforce supports both the Executive Agent for Cyber Test Ranges and the Executive Agent for Cyber Training Ranges, to identify and address relevant needs, define and promulgate standards, and seek efficiencies through focused investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

interoperability testing, mission-level environment testing, and cyber event operations, including cyber testing, cyber training, cyber experimentation, and cyber mission
rehearsal. The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program
managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.” The JMETC program provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that supports
system development to measure and improve interoperability performance and cyber resiliency, which otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component
acquisition programs. The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because
it provides test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs. By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise,
the JMETC program allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment. The JMETC Program has
been aligned to advance the National Defense Strategy (NDS), to test the development of resilient, survivable, federated networks and information ecosystems from the
tactical level up to strategic planning, as well as test and assess cyber defenses, building a more lethal force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Studies and analyses are predominantly performed by independent sources outside of the government such as universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and other private not-for-profit sources.  Research requirements will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections. With the complexities of emerging advanced security threats in the current geopolitical environment, the need for objective analysis and forward looking planning to inform senior leadership for the mid and long-term is vital to remaining strategically competitive.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program supports approximately seventy-five studies per fiscal year performed by a variety of commercial, non-profit, and government research sources.   Research supports a wide variety of national security goals of the Department and is designed to encourage a collaborative research approach among the components of OSD and the Joint Staff.  The research and study projects supported by this program are closely integrated with the strategic goals of the Department of Defense.  The focus of studies varies across a wide spectrum including weapons systems cost analysis, strengthening and leveraging alliances, human resource and military personnel management, examination of innovative technologies, application of technology to operational doctrine, and many other issues of emerging importance.  Most of the actions are long to intermediate-range in outlook, and the program allows organizational leaders to plan and guide their research toward meeting their highest-priority goals and other high-level guidance such as executive branch performance management objectives and the National Defense Strategy of the United States of America.

In following the program efficiencies guidance of the Secretary of Defense, the scope of studies and analyses has been limited as necessary in order to focus upon issues of the highest strategic importance and needs to the Department of Defense while sustaining efforts to support requirements for the Office of the Secretary of Defense developing from legislative direction.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the mission and systems engineering duties as described in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "Establishment of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment," July 13, 2018.  The Director, Mission Engineering (D, ME) and Director, Systems Engineering under the Deputy Director, Mission Engineering &amp; Integration (DD, ME&amp;I) are the principal advisors to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) on systems engineering, development planning, and related technical fields in the Department of Defense (DoD).  The DD, ME&amp;I develops policies and guidance for: (1) the use of systems engineering principles and best practices; (2) the use of systems, and software engineering planning and contracting approaches to enhance manufacturing, reliability, availability and maintainability on major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs); (3) the systems engineering plans (SEPs) for MDAPs including software, and systems engineering considerations in support of lifecycle management and sustainment; and (4) the inclusion of provisions relating to systems engineering and reliability in requests for proposals.  The DD, ME&amp;I develops new methods, processes, and tools (MPTs) incorporating state of the practice into engineering for the DoD in both weapon system design, and design tools.  The DD, ME&amp;I reviews and approves the SEP for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the systems engineering and development planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  Based on the DD, ME&amp;I’s continuous program engagement, the DD, ME&amp;I advises and makes recommendations to the Secretary of Defense regarding systems engineering, development planning, reliability and maintainability (R&amp;M) engineering planning, and the execution of these activities.  As a member of the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), the DD, ME&amp;I provides independent assessments of defense acquisition program’s systems engineering, development planning, technical execution, and risk.  The DD, ME&amp;I also provides input on the inclusion of systems engineering requirements as part of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council's process for joint military requirements (e.g. the Sustainment Key Performance Parameter), to include developing specific inputs relating to each capabilities development document.

In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Systems Engineering (SE) Program Element supports a more lethal force by analyzing near-, mid-, and long-term approaches to realizing mission capability, assessing that capability against anticipated adversaries in relevant AORs, and determine revised system, architectural, tech surprise opportunities to maintain tactical edge, insert technology, improve interoperability and formulate long-term strategies to retain or improve our capabilities against our adversaries. The SE Program Element oversees, initiates, or recommends opportunities to align technology investments to accelerate capability delivery, or modification of existing systems. SE Program Element supports modernizing key capabilities and cultivating workforce talent by developing SE methods, policies, processes, and tools that cross cuts technologies and integrates technical disciplines to advance DoD engineering practices and providing advocacy and oversight for the Department's systems engineering workforce to build a capable, current, and innovative engineering workforce. The SE Program Element also supports reforming the Department for greater performance and affordability by conducting independent technical risk assessments (ITRAs) on MDAPs to advise the USD(R&amp;E) on progress towards achieving key performance parameters, technology maturation, interoperability, and cyber security posture.

The DD, ME&amp;I issues guidance to, and consults with, the Services and Agencies with respect to systems engineering across the Department.  The DD, ME&amp;I improves DoD’s SE capabilities through advocacy, oversight, policy, and guidance for the acquisition workforce responsible for Engineering, and Production, Quality &amp; Manufacturing (PQM); in Engineering Tools and Environments; and in Specialty Engineering.  

The DD, ME&amp;I periodically reviews the organizations and capabilities of the military departments with respect to systems engineering, development planning, and lifecycle management and sustainability, and identifies needed changes or improvements to such organizations and capabilities.  

Beginning in FY 2019, this PE will support activities to carry out responsibilities described in Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM).

Funding from Project Code 143, Program Protection, will be re-aligned to a new Maintaining Technology Advantage Program Element (PE) 0605797D8Z, beginning in FY 2020 to support efforts which have transitioned to the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (STP&amp;E).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element supports the program protection activities of the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (DD, STP&amp;E).  The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cybersecurity and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems, and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified contractor information networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components and critical mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&amp;T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks.

DD, STP&amp;E provides independent assessments of research, technology and defense acquisition program’s system security engineering and program protection implementation.

The DD, STP&amp;E reviews and approves the PPP  for each MDAP, and monitors and reviews the system security engineering planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DD, STP&amp;E in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DD, STP&amp;E systems engineering and technical reviews. 

In FY 2020, funding from this project will transfer to the Maintaining Technology Advantage PE 0605797D8Z, in alignment with the DD, STP&amp;E mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; countering nuclear threats and office management.  Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security and office management.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

Funds address the need for technical experts to assist with standing up the Security Incident Response Council (SIRC) and the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group (NDERG).  The SIRC is an interagency council established by Presidential Policy Directive-35, "United States Nuclear Weapons Command and Control, Safety, and Security," to provide oversight over nuclear weapons security, incident response capabilities, transportation of U.S. nuclear weapons, and to exercise oversight and coordination with sub-working group.  The NDERG is a senior DoD oversight body, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to oversee and make decisions regarding implementation of recommendations from internal and external DoD nuclear enterprise reviews.

Additionally, OASD(NCB/NM) serves as the focal point for DoD activities and initiatives related to the dual missions of sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and countering the threat from nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation.  Funding will be sent to Sandia National Laboratories to lead a team comprised of Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to develop a nuclear deterrence model.  The modeling and analysis results will support the Nuclear Weapons Council strategic planning to include modernization strategies and stockpile composition assessments and investment tradeoffs.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

Defense Architecture Support includes development, analysis, testing and evaluation of DoD IT Enterprise Reference and solution architecture products in support of the DoD's Joint Information Environment and the closely related Mission Partner Environment.  
The Department maintains a catalog of architecture data holdings and provides users the ability to store, search, retrieve, and use DoD architecture data through capabilities provided by the architecture portal.  The portal is a central, federated hub for discovery, accessibility, understandability, and reusability of architectures.  With the ability to import different architecture tool data and display disparate architecture data in a uniform, consistent method for ease of use and understanding.  The portal provides a federated environment for sharing of architectures, mission threads, and other related capability integrated information between various authoritative repositories to increase effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making in a dynamic environment by our customers.  Implementations are accessible on both the NIPRNET (unclassified) and SIPRNET (Collateral Classified).  Key features of the Defense Architecture Support program focus on: (1) Research and Development of JIE and MPE architectures, (2) Making JIE and MPE architecture data visible, accessible, trusted, understandable, and interoperable (2) enabling reuse of validated architecture data to build "composite" integrated architectures; (3) enabling architecture analysis; and, (4) integrating architecture data into the DoD mainstream decision-making processes.  The Department of the Air Force, Army, and Navy CIO's collaborate in the development of federation web services via the Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Panel under the oversight of the DoD CIOs Enterprise Architecture and Service Board to ensure DoD-wide access to and usability of all components of the composite DoD enterprise architecture model, enterprise services, data and technical standards.

The Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the National Leadership Command Capability (NLCC) Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National and Nuclear Command Capabilities for our National Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO’s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Three overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Nuclear C2, Integrated Missile Defense, Tactical Warning, Global Strike; and 3) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.

The Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense’s Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) III software program and has a “high” impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253. This program is funded under Budget Activity 6, RDT&amp;E Management Support because it includes studies and analysis in support of RDT&amp;E efforts.
In support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), GPS continues to provide a force multiplier for the Joint Force and key US allies. Its modernization, and alternative, complement means of PNT provision will maintain this advantage. Superior PNT provides enhanced Joint Force lethality through precision targeting, exacting ISR, efficient logistics, blue force tracking, and a myriad of other force enhancements. These are enjoyed by the Joint Force and key US allies. As such, they ensure efficient and effective force employment.
NLCC provides guidance, oversight and policy direction support for Senior Leadership communications, Continuity communications and NC3 which enable the National Security Strategy's "build a more lethal force" line of effort.  By coordinating and integrating with the National Security Agency in the development of a security policy that provides guidance to the NLCC community on cyber secure connection interfaces and security patterns on a continuous basis to addresses hardware, firmware and software vulnerabilities.  Working with DISA, the Services, and other federal government agencies to ensure the safety of our Nation's critical undersea cable infrastructure.  Provide guidance and oversight to all NLCC cryptographic modernization programs, ensure NSA and the appropriate Service delivers their cryptographic capability on time and work with the combatant commanders' staff to ensure they have operationalized any potential risks with potential cryptographic program delays.   Coordinate the DoD's critical time dissemination resiliency plans and initiatives with senior representatives from the precision, navigation and timing (PNT) community.  Work with the Joint Staff, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps to ensure their PNT plans include primary and alternate capabilities.  Continue analysis of White House, DoD Services, DoD Agencies and Combatant Command initiatives to ensure the effectiveness of our airborne command, control and communications, commercial and military satellite communications, and their supporting ground infrastructure.  Analysis will ensure our Senior Leadership C3 is operationally effective during all phases of a conflict.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/ STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets. This PE funds the administrative support to the SBIR/STTR programs including policy development, monitoring program execution for participating DOD agencies, outreach to small businesses, training for DOD small business and contracting professionals, and an annual conference to bring together the stakeholders for networking and program updates.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element provides funding to support efforts to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  The targeting of U.S. capabilities by our strategic competitors create the potential to degrade core U.S. military technological advantages through unwanted technology transfer.  The technology transfer, primarily unclassified technology, threatens DoD's ability to maintain the technology advantage required to support the lethality and survivability of the Joint Force.  DoD is executing a campaign plan to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  First DoD is promoting strategic technology investment to provide DoD access to new and innovative technology.  These investments are required to create breakthroughs in key areas of basic research, foster transition and decrease time to market of applied research to economically viable companies, and harvest U.S. innovation or with likeminded allies.  Secondly, DoD must ensure its strategic technology investments are protected against unwanted technology transfer by developing and maintaining the tools and techniques that enable the U.S. engage in technology transfer at the time, place, and parties of our choosing.  Thirdly, DoD must combat adversaries' attempts to thwart U.S. technology security mechanisms to control technology transfer.  The Department will support these three efforts by developing the appropriate suite of analytic tools, a data acquisition strategy, and utilize program protection activities to address the threat over the long term.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific RDA practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information integration of defense exportability features and improve program protection planning.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Significant amounts of DoD’s technical information resides on unclassified networks where it is at risk of being targeted by adversarial cyber espionage campaigns. In addition, DoD’s technical information is subject to other loss mechanisms.  Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property, enhancing the competitive capabilities of our national industrial base, and maintaining DoD’s technology advantage. This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, system maintenance /sustainment and component manufacturing.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security (e.g., implement cybersecurity standards on contractor information system networks, report cyber-intrusion incidents, manage deemed exports, and other mechanisms that result in the loss of this information) to protect this information from all loss mechanisms.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses, rethink how we safeguard our capabilities, and deter our strategic competitors. 

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action to include deterring our strategic competitors and identifying opportunities to promote our innovation base.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The JAPEC requires the ability to detect and characterize past technology losses, conduct damage assessments of lost information, and provide various insights with predictive value. Together with supporting organizations, the JAPEC enables comprehensive, detailed assessments of U.S. military technological vulnerability, as well as inform the development and application of effective policies, countermeasures, and enforcement actions to preserve U.S. technical superiority in all warfighting domains.

JAPEC, and supporting organizations, require an analytic capability to synchronize, integrate, coordinate and inform DoD efforts in order protect the acquisition and investment in sensitive U.S. technologies from adversaries and better exploit opportunities to deter, deny and disrupt adversary activities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense for research and engineering (R&amp;E) matters.  In this capacity, the USD(R&amp;E) has the responsibility to conduct analyses and studies; develop policies; provide technical leadership, oversight and advice; make recommendations; and issue guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) R&amp;E programs.  Additionally, the USD(R&amp;E) provides technical support on R&amp;E aspects of programs subject to review by the Defense Acquisition Board, to include assessments of technology maturity consistent with DoD acquisition policy.  The mission of the DoD R&amp;E program is to create, demonstrate, prototype, and apply technology that enables affordable and decisive military superiority.  Pursuing the R&amp;E mission requires attention to:  (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the USD(R&amp;E) (OUSD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the USD(R&amp;E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.

The PE provides engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the USD(R&amp;E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and to ensure that the technology being developed is affordable and helps minimize system development risk.  The Defense Technology Analysis project conducts assessments and analysis to ensure maximum utilization of research and development funds and to accomplish the overall objectives of the S&amp;T program.  Funds are required for technical, analytical and management support, equipment and supplies, travel, and publications.

The DoD's key expertise for reviewing and guiding R&amp;E programs resides in the USD(R&amp;E).  The USD(R&amp;E) staff augment their responsibilities through their connections to technology experts in various fields throughout academia, industry, and government.  The Defense Support Teams project supports the directed responsibilities by building teams of technology experts to conduct program technical assessments.  The teams analyze the key engineering problem areas and offer adjustments in the development and test plan; alternate technical approaches; or new technologies that could enable successful development.  The teams provide unbiased reviews and gather advice from the Nation's leading technical experts.

This PE also provides funding for Data Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis to establish a joint analysis capability to conduct comprehensive assessments of unclassified information losses, engaging acquisition and intelligence sources to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Most DoD technical information resides on unclassified networks where it is at risk of being targeted for cyber espionage campaigns.  Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base.  To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities.  DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result in the loss of this information.  These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary.  The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities.  This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.

In FY 2020, this funding is transferred to the Maintaining Technology Advantage PE 0605797D8Z, in accordance with the new OUSD(R&amp;E) re-organization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The project integrated the Department’s critical acquisition and technology list with a Joint Requirements Oversight Council critical technology and capabilities list.  For the remainder of FY 2018, the project will collocate the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) joint analysis capability with DoD’s Damage Assessment Management Office (DAMO).  The project will integrate collection efforts to produce one list of critical acquisition programs and capabilities that identify the Department’s critical acquisition programs that are tiered for proactive protection efforts.  It will continue to develop links to the security community and adjust to the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 901 mandated reorganization to develop enhanced protection for critical acquisition programs and technologies.  The project is linked with the DoD cross functional team (CFT) on Maintaining DoD Technological Advantage and will begin to adapt joint analysis capability to address any changes in the Department’s strategic direction.  In FY 2018, the program identified an initial set of resources for FY 2019 and will plan future resource requirements for enhanced protection of critical acquisition programs and technologies, adjusted for the FY 2017 NDAA reorganization.  The program will standardize projects to identify feasible protection and safeguards; develop dynamic links with program protection planning activities; and demonstrate advanced analytic tools, coupled with identification of additional information feeds/sources of data.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides resources to support Acquisition Program Managers, Chief Developmental Testers, and Lead DT&amp;E Organizations in the development of comprehensive, efficient, and innovative DT&amp;E strategies/plans to support key acquisition milestones and engineering/programmatic decisions.  This project also manages the Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) career field and curriculum for the DoD acquisition workforce, develops policy and guidance for the conduct of DT&amp;E within DoD, and prepares reports to Congress as required.  On behalf of the USD(R&amp;E) this project executes the following activities:

- Develop policy and guidance to ensure efficient and effective DT&amp;E across the DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- Review and oversee developmental test processes across the services, especially during the formative stages of programs, to include prototyping and experimentation.
- Ensures that developmental test strategies beginning at Milestone A, are documented in Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  Reviews and approves/disapproves the developmental test and evaluation strategy/plans within TEMPs.
- Provide DT&amp;E subject matter experts to assist programs in constructing Developmental Evaluation Frameworks (DEFs) for inclusion in the TEMP.
- Provide cybersecurity subject matter experts to assist programs in focusing DT&amp;E efforts to identify potential threat vectors and associated risks early in development.
- Provide independent DT&amp;E Sufficiency Assessments prior to Milestone B and C decisions with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle.
- When requested by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense, provide independent developmental test assessments in support of USD(A&amp;S) and Service Major Defense Acquisition Programs.
- Support the development of independent technical risk assessments and advise the Secretary on the progress toward meeting Key Performance Parameters, technology maturation, reliability growth projections, interoperability, and cybersecurity posture before any decision to grant Milestone A or B approval, or enter into low-rate initial production or full rate production for ACAT ID programs or when requested by the Secretary.
- Support rapid prototyping, rapid fielding, and technology demonstrations efforts in the development of tailored Middle Tier of Acquisition DT&amp;E strategies/plans.
- Serve as the Functional Leader for the T&amp;E acquisition career field.  Establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training, and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&amp;E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.
- Manage the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160M.
- Coordinate with the Test Resources Management Center (TRMC) to identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the TRMC strategic plan.
- Coordinate with the Deputy Director for Mission Engineering &amp; Integration (ME&amp;I) to ensure that the DT&amp;E activities of the DoD are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the ME&amp;I and development planning processes of the Department.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the National Defense Strategy. These RDT&amp;E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  


This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.

In FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&amp;E funding in FY 2019 described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.

The FY 2020 budget proposal includes additional resources to support the Enterprise Visiability and Maintainability of Operation and Support Costs (EVAMOSC). EVAMOSC supports CAPE's responsibility to develop and maintain a database of actual operating and support (O&amp;S) costs for major weapons systems, as required in 10 USC Ch. 137, Sec. 2337a and further refined by Sec. 832 of the 2019 NDAA.  Additionally, the EVAMOSC data capability will directly support development and reporting of readiness metrics associated with implementation of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

-	Improving cost analysis tools to inform program, budget, and Defense Acquisition Board reviews.
-	In support of the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA), independently assessing, analyzing, and where appropriate, updating cost indices, inflation rates, and escalation rates used in preparing the President’s Budget for major acquisition programs.
-	Developing, assessing, and enhancing databases that provide cost data for major weapon systems. This includes the development and maintenance of a database of actual operating and support (O&amp;S) costs for major weapon systems as required in Title 10 United States Code and further refined by the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.
-	Improving estimates produced by the Defense Employment and Purchases Projection System (DEPPS) and Defense Translator, which are used to support decision briefs to the President, Congress, Secretary of Defense, and Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
-	Modeling and analyzing aircraft survivability against various threat detection approaches and in various operational environments. Assessing the ability of aircraft and weapons to operation in anti-access/area denial regions.
-	Modeling logistical vulnerabilities against various threats and in various operational environments. Assessing the cost and mission effectiveness of proposed improvements.
-      Modifying and supporting a wargaming repository. 
-      Expanding analysis of OCO funding data to determine how funding was actually spent as distinguished from DoD base budget resources. Provide normalization information that can be applied to existing Defense Resources Data Warehouse (DRDW) data for the current budget position.</r2:Text>

Investments support DoD's current and emerging OPSEC capability gaps, including countering advances in non-U.S. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and denying the understanding of U.S. capability, capacity, and readiness from adversaries.  These investments spur Department innovation and preserve U.S. technology superiority.  DOSI analyses and engineering activities lead the community's ability to sustain and maximize technology advantages as they are transitioned to Service and Agency programs for sustainment, maintenance, and capacity programming.  Results of tests and evaluations enable the community to identify OPSEC measure and countermeasure effectiveness in current and emerging operational environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition, management, and contracting strategy involves the following:
• Adhere to guidance outlined in DoD 5000, Directive 7, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and FAR Supplement Policies and Procedures.
• RDT&amp;E OPSEC capabilities, systems, tools, products, and services through a disciplined, yet agile, process that ensures signature management and signature obfuscation capabilities are available for DoD components.
• Sustain an acquisition process that is responsive and responsible to internal and external customers and stakeholders.
• Continue to support the warfighter’s need for capabilities that dominate today’s dynamic, networked battlespace by providing strategy across the DoD for the planning and execution of OPSEC.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>
                                            <r2:PerformanceMetrics>RDT&amp;E performance metrics are used to establish baseline and assess progress toward enhancement and increase of OPSEC capabilities and capacities across the DoD’s assigned responsibilities. The following metrics are based on the ROI of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for OPSEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E successes across the Department:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered next generation capabilities address Combatant Commander and/or DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed capabilities include affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

The following metrics are based on the return on investment of RDT&amp;E investments and provide assessment to meeting:
1) operational requirements for MILDEC capabilities, 2) technical requirements for successful engineering, and 3) programmatic requirements for sustaining RDT&amp;E successes across the Department:
- Seventy percent of evaluations and tests on engineered next generation capabilities address CCMD and DoD Component requirements. The remaining thirty percent serve as the pivot to improve service level operational capabilities or to address alternate technologies. 
- One hundred percent of completed capability development includes affiliated specifications, architecture, raw material inventories, and documentation. They are maintained in a centralized database repository used to support feedback and future efforts.
- Fifty percent of next generation capabilities transition into DoD Component Program Management Offices and Program Executive Offices to fulfill DoD urgent needs, while the remaining fifty percent are reviewed for alternative operational utility and sent to the appropriate Service or Agency for application.</r2:PerformanceMetrics>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Intelligence Capabilities and Innovation (ICI) funds intelligence problem curation processes, commercial technology piloting, and the development, testing, prototyping and demonstration of innovative intelligence capabilities to integrate intelligence and counterintelligence activities across numerous domains and technical areas including Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurements and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), electronic warfare, cyber, Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), multi-sensor integration, biometrics, identity management, collection management, special communications, clandestine operations, and tagging, tracking and locating.  Innovation is the rapid experimentation and development of existing technologies (hardware, software, licenses, databases, analytics, etc.) to create new capabilities and demonstrate their intelligence value in support of warfighter operations.

ICI also funds Project Maven a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED)  for full motion video Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) ISR platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer/near peer competitor strategy. Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation.   Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within Full Motion Video (FMV) images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).  The MAVEN funding will move to the newly created Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team, Program Element (PE) 0307588D8Z beginning in FY 2020.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. The CWMD Systems program supports the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the trans regional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This Program Element (PE) funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD technologies, including situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. 

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This project funds research, development, test and evaluations efforts to support planning, development, and sustainment of CWMD technologies, including situational awareness information systems, or other systems as needed.

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team (AWCFT) funds Project Maven, a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) for Full Motion Video (FMV) Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer/near peer competitor strategy. Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team funds Project Maven which fields increasing amounts of automation to FMV ground exploitation stations for TUAVs, Medium Altitude, High Altitude ISR platforms and accelerates the development and deployment of AI capabilities across the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, including exploitation of CEM, ACINT, OPIR and PAI exploitation. Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from GEOINT. Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) was established in accordance with 10 USC Sec 2508 Industrial Base Fund direction to strengthen the force posture of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will in support of the Warfighter today and tomorrow.  The IBAS Program provides the Department with a unique capability to achieve the strategic goals within the 2018 National Defense Strategy for a strong, resilient, responsive and healthy US Industrial Base (IB) that improves the Departments force readiness posture.  This program is uniquely positioned to improve the US Industrial Base’s competitiveness and ability to respond to the Departments needs by applying focused investments to: 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities and, 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base.

Manufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge and sustain in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. 

IBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. 

IBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:
1) advancing and sustaining both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors, 
2) preserving critical and unique manufacturing and design skills, 
3) supporting and expanding reliable sources, and 
4) identifying and mitigating supply chain vulnerabilities</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>IBAS mission is to strengthen the force posture and readiness of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will to national security needs.

The IBAS program has a multi-pronged approach to identify projects: 1) assessments of the national technology and industrial base by the OSD Acquisition &amp; Sustainment (A&amp;S), Office of Industrial Policy (INDPOL) as directed by 10 U.S. Code 2505, and 2) working directly in partnership with defense programs, and 3) working directly with industry. INDPOL collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy and resilient defense industrial base:

1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities
2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers
3) Foreign Dependency from high risk sources or countries
4) Education and manufacturing workforce skills 

The continued corrosion on the industrial base is a direct and severe threat to National Security, especially with the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition of authoritarian peer nations.  

FY 2020 and beyond investment strategies will also be informed by, 1) the findings of Executive Order (EO) 13806, "Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States," and 2) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS). The EO assessment identified nearly 300 risks across 16 sectors; concludes the current state and trajectory of the U.S. industrial base and our capacity to support readiness is in question; and requires significant changes including increased investment for the industrial base.

Findings from the nine traditional defense sectors and seven cross-cutting sectors will be used to inform both product specific investments as well as developing enterprise-wide initiatives to mitigate and capture domestic capabilities. 

IBAS investments seek to ameliorate industrial base and manufacturing issues to strengthen the defense industrial base. All projects are evaluated for industrial base risks using fragility and criticality risk criteria, similar to the more familiar probability and consequence risk criteria.  Fragility examines characteristics that make a specific capability likely to be disrupted.  Criticality examines characteristics that make a specific capability difficult to replace if disrupted. 

IBAS currently focuses efforts and investments in four categories:  Radars, Sensors, and Electronics Sectors; Materials Sector; Munitions and Missiles Sector; and Cross-cutting Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation.

Cornerstone Other Transaction Agreement (OTA): Enhanced efficiency of IBAS program execution will be supported by a new non-Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) OTA procurement vehicle called Cornerstone, established February 2018 in partnership between ODASD (Industrial Policy) and the Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC). Cornerstone was specifically designed for industrial base investments to meet the Departments needs to improve readiness and sustainment through proactive engagement and investment within and across supply chains. Cornerstone provides the ability to access (18) different industry sectors under one agreement where all parties have agreed to one common management agreement and one intellectual property agreement, and it allows the Government to open or direct solicit tasks as legally appropriate against OTA statues. Cornerstone’s period of performance is “in perpetuity” with no overall ceiling, with task award ceilings. IBAS authorities coupled with Cornerstone enable the department to efficiently execute IBAS investments – positioning the industrial base to modernize at pace with our military.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Propulsion Foundry Improvement:
This effort addresses a critical issue by maintaining a unique and vital manufacturing capability at the only U.S. commercial producer of critical propulsors.  In 2014, the producer announced it was preparing to close its facility and relocate operations OCONUS.  Investing in casting equipment allows the producer to develop additional skills, which should drive revenue and increase the foundry's utilization rate.  Keeping the U.S. foundry operational is vital to maintaining and protecting domestic production of Navy submarine and surface ship propulsors.

Electron Beam Welding (EBW):
Alternative electron beam welding (EBW) processes are required to support critical path production timelines for large volume support structures.  EBW enables significant cost, schedule, and quality benefits over traditional, domestically available arc welding technologies.  Currently large volume EBW is only available at a foreign source.  This effort seeks to establish a U.S. capability via a phased approach, which includes: welding process development, small scale prototype demonstrations, acquisition, installation and commissioning of large scale capable equipment, and full-scale prototype demonstration.  EBW will enable the Navy to reduce the time required to produce large scale parts with significantly better repeatability, quality, and reliability, and at a lower cost.</r2:Text>

Expand manufacturing capability for Cold Rolled Aluminum $10.000: optimize the manufacturing processes for aluminum armor alloys that are enabled by cold mill upgrades, which include dynamic shape rolling, non-contact shape measurement, automatic gauge, profile and flatness controls.  The enhanced and upgraded cold mill will rapidly prototype aluminum armor manufacturing processes that not only optimize quality and throughput, but examine and mature processes to prototype mill products that enable more cost efficient downstream processing.


Large Scale Classified Electron Beam Welding $15.000: described above under Congressional Add FY 2018 Accomplishments.

Risk reduction for tungsten defense products $10.000: Defense applications for tungsten range widely: from consumables such as ammunition, bombs, and missiles to critical components in radar, communication equipment, tungsten carbide tooling inserts and ferrotungsten used in the production of super alloys in jet turbines. Several DoD programs have a supply chain vulnerability of either one domestic source or only foreign owned sources for tungsten. Dependence on a sole source results in higher costs to the DoD, inability to meet surge requirements, and creates a potential single point failure that could jeopardize the warfighter's access to an essential piece of material. This effort seeks to reduce risk and enhance the U.S. capability to produce tungsten through critical modernization investments in areas that support DoD, improve quality, efficiency and increase overall capacity.</r2:Text>

The objectives of this multiple fiscal years of effort include: analyze the MIB ecosystem (people, processes, and systems); empower the Manufacturing Industrial Base; monitor the dynamic threat environment; identify operational vulnerabilities and prevent the impact of cyber threats; and maintain resiliency and cybersecurity assurance.

Southeast Manufacturing Skills Challenge: Similar to STEM efforts such as First Robotics, the SMSC project seeks to close gaps in industrial capabilities, increase industrial base readiness, elevate the prestige of manufacturing, and identify future supply chain members by establishing a manufacturing skills challenge.  This effort across multiple fiscal years starting in FY 2017 is a collaboration between OSD and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to define and address strategic manufacturing value chain vulnerabilities and technologies, and strengthen workforce skills. This effort includes competitions with "Support for a prize”. The pilot effort will focus on welding and machining workforce in the Southeast corridor including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina where large ship, aerospace, and automotive growth have created workforce skills and supply chain challenges.  

Accelerator Pilot Project, continuing from FY2016, FY2017 and across multiple future fiscal years, is an effort that comprehensively addresses some of the discovery-to-transition infrastructure shortfalls, including both identifying emerging companies and increasing business viability for startup and other nascent companies focused on advanced manufacturing and application technologies. The Pilot Program will be uniquely focused on hardware and manufacturing based companies.  The comprehensive program will provide access to business strategy and development, mentors in their technology domain, DoD users, investors, and prototype manufacturing facilities.  The first cohort of six to ten startup teams in Phase 1, will encompass the following components: Curriculum and Faculty; Advisor/Mentor Network; Marketing coalition of public and private partners and sponsors; Solicitation and Selection Plan; “demo days” at the end of the program.</r2:Text>

Lack of awareness and prestige of the career opportunities stifled potential candidates from entering. Surging defense production budgets concurrent with rising U.S. manufacturing are placing significant pressures on states and companies to increase entrants and accelerate development.  Specialty defense skills such as those related to ship construction and precision optics are highly constrained.  The focus in FY 2019 is to coalesce past and ongoing workforce development efforts for engineering and trade skills into a structured framework to elevate the prestige of and need for the technical skills; accelerate entrants into the technical skills, and comprehensively accelerate training for the technical skills. . This FY 2019 initiative shall coalesce prior projects, Manufacturing Skills Challenge and ELEV8 Supply Chain Resiliency, and expand into precision optics and additional shipyard trade skills, into an industrial base enterprise level.

Specific Efforts:
Manufacturing Skills Challenge (MSC). This effort was initiated in prior years, and continues into FY 2020. MSC project description is addressed below for FY 2020 Plans.</r2:Text>

DoD is dependent on a single foreign source of unique and proprietary rayon-based carbon fibers for critical materials requirements in DoD strategic and tactical strike missile systems, ballistic missile defense interceptors, military and civilian space launch systems, and other hypersonic defense systems.  Current materials are either produced at a foreign sole source outside the United States or are no longer in production due to material obsolescence.  These materials represent a high risk to key DoD defense system supply chains.   The purpose of this project is to fund needed evaluation, demonstration, qualification and transition of potential substitute carbon fibers produced from domestically-produced commercial sources of poly-acrylic-nitrile (PAN)-based carbon fibers and therefore mitigate the supply risk of sole foreign and obsolete sources.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems program provides funding for research, development, integration, and deployment of CWMD capabilities. Funding is allocated to a portfolio of projects and activities in response to Combatant Command, joint, and Military Service capability needs and research initiatives. The CWMD Systems program supports the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”

The CWMD Systems program is organized to develop, enhance, mature and transition technologies across the RDT&amp;E continuum, from Advanced Technology Development through Operational Systems Development, as well as limited sustainment in unique cases. A focus area is investment in CWMD-related technologies that require additional development to transition to fielded capabilities, in response to validated, prioritized requirements. This effort fills a seam in which capability gaps are not being addressed adequately or sufficiently to meet warfighter needs. The CWMD Systems program closes gaps identified by specialized military units and leverages prior S&amp;T investments to continue development and fielding of operational systems to those units. 

The program’s legacy focus on CWMD situational awareness capabilities remains a significant component of the investment portfolio. U.S. Special Operations Command, which assumed CWMD mission responsibilities in January 2017 per the Unified Command Plan, is providing focus and guidance for development of CWMD situational awareness capabilities. The CWMD Systems program funds initiatives to close CWMD situational awareness gaps by leveraging mature technologies, modifying existing systems, and utilizing technology-enabled analytical cells to provide support to Combatant Commands and other joint and Service commands. These cells curate, synthesize, and contextualize CWMD information for end-users. This hybrid approach facilitates cross-organizational information sharing and collaboration, necessary for addressing the transregional character of WMD proliferation. 

During FY 2018 and FY 2019 the CWMD Systems program utilized four Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) program elements (BA-3 / PE#0303310D8Z, BA-5 / PE#0305310D8Z, BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z, and BA-7 / PE#0607310D8Z), as well as an Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) "CWMD Sustainment" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-2531).  Reallocation of resources beginning in FY 2020 will eliminate the BA-6 / PE#0306310D8Z program element and address O&amp;M requirements with the "Threat Reduction and Arms Control" line (PE#0901388D8Z ORC-3501).

This Program Element (PE) funds upgrades and improvements to fielded systems or system components or enhancements to prototype technologies that are designed for the CWMD mission or can be repurposed to support it.  Funding is used to integrate prototypes into existing systems or modify and enhance existing systems. 

This appropriation funds travel to support the requirements of this program, and work (including manpower) performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DoD CIO Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides for focused research, development, testing and integration of technology and technical solutions critical to the Defense Cybersecurity and Information (CS&amp;IA) Assurance Program to meet the requirements of 10 USC 2224 (Defense Information Assurance Program), 44 USC 3544, (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002), OMB Circular A-130, and DoD Directives/Instructions 8500, 8510, 8520, 8530, and 8540.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it integrates technology and technical solutions to the Defense CS&amp;IA Program.

ISSP RDT&amp;E funds support the DoD CIO and its mission partners: on architecting, engineering, and technical matters for developing governance processes and structures; on evolving and enabling a more integrated and synchronized Joint Information Environment (JIE) to provide the means for more integrated information sharing and collaboration that also endeavors to close identified gaps across all mission areas with a shared network of core enterprise services; on the continued development of the U.S. Government’s ability to prevent and defend against adversarial and/or commercial information and communications technology supply-chain attacks on its mission critical systems, networks, and devices; on improving oversight of the life-cycle management of cybersecurity risks; and on the integration of cybersecurity standards, methods, and procedures across the DoD for a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.
As specified below, the DoD CIO’s investments in: the information assurance scholarship program; the integration of policies with the risk management framework to strengthen cybersecurity controls; cyber secure cloud computing; inclusion of  cybersecurity considerations in hardware, software, and firmware early in the acquisition life-cycle; and analyses to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to model network behavior, improve cyber threat detection, and transform information security – these investments all directly support the National Defense Strategy affirmed need to continue to modernize our capabilities in resilient cyber defenses, in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the cultivation and development of workforce expertise in cybersecurity and information assurance to improve cyber capabilities across all military operations and support domains.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.
Assessments of the ability of future forces to achieve objectives at the campaign level. These assessments include wargaming, qualitative, and quantitative analytic methods. They will both inform and be informed by the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) defense planning scenarios (DPS). They will identify risk and potential trade-space among force structure, capabilities, and readiness to inform senior leader decision-making.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementNote>The FY2019 funding request was reduced by 2.655 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, communication, computing network, and Information Infrastructure (C4II) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.  

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C4II capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C4II capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance and mission assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).  
     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes initiating the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.In support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), rebuilding the warfighting readiness of the Joint Force (Lethality); Net Centricity improves strategic and tactical C2 and Communications, CIO is actively supporting the services to accelerate modernization of Command and Control and Communication (C3) systems.  As outlined in the NDS, the return of great power competition elevates the requirement for the Joint Force to dominate a highly contested conflict.  DoD cannot assume that the same robust, uninterrupted, tactical-to-strategic command and control network will remain intact against a peer-level adversary.  Rather than existing across a single domain, these new network paths must leverage space, air, land, surface, sub-surface, and cyber to ensure redundancy against attack.  To build confidence in our communication ability in a contested theater, DoD must make targeted investments that increase communication resiliency.  This resilient architecture leverages multiple waveforms carried across space, air, land, surface, sub-surface and cyber minimizes periods that C2 will be degraded when communicating in a highly contested environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>IMD project supports the Department’s governance process for balancing IMD supply and demand and addressing how to modernize IMD generation.  In order to support weapons systems with intelligence data, we need to improve the modeling, simulation and assessment process for weapon systems prior to material solutions to better understand investment needs for both platforms and intelligence data. IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following for weapon systems: to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In order to support weapons systems with intelligence data we need to improve the modeling, simulation and assessment process for weapon systems prior to material solutions to better understand investment needs for both platforms and intelligence data. IMD is all source intelligence derived data necessary to do the following for weapon systems: to identify and counter constantly improving threat weapons and radar systems; optimize sensor design and validate sensor functionality; and support system test, evaluation and deployment.  Modern weapon systems are reliant upon increasingly voluminous and precise IMD to meet performance requirements.  This demand signal for mission support data is increasing due to requirements for both analyst-evaluated, precise data and machine-processed data to be used by weapons and control systems with increasing autonomy.  This increasing requirement is highlighting the need to have a big data/data autonomy environment to support advanced weapon systems.  In order for the community to meet modern weapons system requirements, there needs to be a measured shift with balance and attention paid to legacy and new capability needs.  There are unacceptable gaps, compounded by non-assessed program office needs and requirements that may not be obtainable; therefore, balancing supply and demand is urgently needed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Will develop data algorithms and models for use by the Intelligence Community and operational forces on weapon systems and platform sensors to collect, generate, and utilize IMD autonomously.
- Will continue the development and evaluation of a holistic IMD architecture supporting the Department’s Third Offset effort and 5th Generation warfighting concepts.
- Will modernize the current architecture to increase efficiency for IMD reprogrammers to access, analyze, and produce mission data files for operational forces to support legacy and future machine-centric production.
- Will build better program plans for IMD demands by integrating full scale Cost vs. Capability Analysis (CCA) with blue and red
modeling and simulation modules to form a force-on-force campaign analysis capability to focus and prioritize IMD demands.
- Will increase efficiency and production balance for IMD supply by continuing the enterprise-wide dashboard tool to monitor IMD supply, demand, and workflow management.
- Will improve enterprise-wide access to IMD sources by continuing data and database standardization, increase data discoverability, and user access.</r2:Text>

Initiate addition of ground combat systems into the environments.

Complete the development phase of the Acquisition, Intelligence and Requirements Visualization of Enterprise Workflows (AIRViEW) dashboard tool that enables data-driven resource decision making at a Departmental level.  The tool captures and tracks extensive intelligence data requirements for combat systems in acquisition and operations, and the Defense Intelligence Enterprise production response to those requirements, along with valuable business analytics.

Complete the prototyping of enhancements to intelligence mission data enterprise databases (to include consumer elements) for the sake of enhancing and speeding data and information sharing, shrinking response times to adversary changes from months/years to days/weeks.

Complete the development of a prototype that accelerates accumulation of raw intelligence data about modern complex emitters that is a precursor to Electronic Warfare intelligence data.  The data is processed into a form that is more rapidly consumable and leads to a shorter response time from detection of new operating modes by adversary emitters to reprogramming centers’ creation of the updated mission data files for friendly aircraft that will enhance their survivability and lethality.

Complete efforts related to evaluating and improving the availability of an intelligence workforce that provides the Department with high quality support to acquisition programs.  Institute a first-ever acquisition-intelligence training course at Defense Acquisition University, and articulate a career occupation program path for professionals with suitable competencies.</r2:Text>

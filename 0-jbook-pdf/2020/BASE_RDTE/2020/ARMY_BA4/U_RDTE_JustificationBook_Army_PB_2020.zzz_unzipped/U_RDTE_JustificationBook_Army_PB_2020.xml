                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses on four major efforts: 1) High Power Microwave Lethality Prototype testing, testing and modeling will be performed to ascertain the vulnerabilities of critical electrical circuits and components in order to attack adversary systems, such as unmanned aerial systems, and to protect U.S. assets and infrastructure in use by the Warfighter; 2) Advanced Electronic/Environmental Control Unit Thermal Management Prototypes of different sizes will be built and tested to reduce the magnitude of fuel used at forward operating bases consumed by environmental control units to keep major electronic systems cool in austere environments.  Prototypes will be used to fully evaluate distributed cooling and legacy approaches; 3) Technology Complex Compound Materials for Thermal/Energy Management prototypes will be manufactured and tested for suitability in high velocity impacts.  The planned compound is Coordinative Molecular Bond Armor Material and has potential to provide ballistics and thermal protection; 4) Upgrades are planned for the Advanced Measurement Optical Range facility to support laser radar development and testing.  . 5) HardWare-In-the-Loop (HWIL) for both open-loop device characterization and closed-loop dynamic hardware-in-the-loop simulation to characterize guidance and track-loop performance.  Simulate trajectories, and engagement would be utilized to drive the HWIL simulations (e.g. 3DOF, 6DOF).  6) Integration of a Fire Control (FC) for the near-term Long-Range Weapon System requirements for initial operational capability. Long range hypersonic weapon analysis, integration and fielding support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project TR5 funds United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/ Army Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) efforts to develop the associated operational prototyping, experimentation, operational analysis, and modeling and simulation in support of missile defense capabilities for current and future Forces.

USASMDC/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for ground-based midcourse defense (GMD), the Army integrator for global missile defense, and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). Army Regulation (AR) 10-87 Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007 and AR 5-22 The Army Force Modernization Proponent System dated 19 August 2009 designates USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Global Missile Defense. As the Army proponent GMD, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conducting warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identifying capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and developing Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions to realize the GMD capabilities. As the Army integrator for global missile defense, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for reviewing programs managed by the Army, other Services, Defense agencies and National agencies to ensure that they are correctly synchronized and will ultimately provide the capabilities required by USSTRATCOM to execute its global missile defense responsibilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>In 2018, the following initiatives were completed: 

Maintained uninterrupted network communications for the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System (NCR IADS).  Implemented an enterprise-level risk management framework certification for the NCR IADS ground circuit initiative (GCI) communications network to support information assurance accreditation for the network that supports all weapons and sensor communications.
	
Integrated four wide area surveillance sensors into the NORAD surveillance architecture
		
Delivered the initial increment of capability and conducted a successful program review of the Digital Attack Surface Execution Environment (DASEE) capability development project with ASD R&amp;E.  ASD R&amp;E approved an installation at the Aerospace Defense Facility - Colorado (ADF-C) to enable processing of effective processing of large quantities of intelligence messages for incorporation in big data/artificial intelligence applications. 

Domestic Operations Awareness and Assessment Response Tool (DAART) was used extensively for all the major domestic events such as the multiple hurricanes, the Hawaii volcano eruptions, Western wildfires, and event monitoring around the national capital during the fourth of July celebrations.  The tool was also upgraded extensively to enable optical character reading of UAV video feeds with proprietary feeds, so that metadata for the event could be distributed with the video for improved use of the system. 
	
Cyber Warrior Training Capability provided Missile Defense Agency (MDA) with a virtual representation of the Network Intrusion incident Monitoring (NIM) system as part of a cyber defense training program to develop and maintain proficiency for MDA cyber defense operators responsible for monitoring the weapon system networks.  This system was verified and validated through independent assessment sponsored by MDA.

Coordinated fielding of a STRATCOM Strategic Instruction (SI) 538-02, BMDS Physical Security Program-compliant Integrated Electronic Security Systems (IESS) for Site 512 and Site K AN/TPY-2 Forward Based Mode (FBM) radar sites.

Coordinated implementation of an Authority to Operate (ATO) for the Integrated Electronic Security Systems (IESS) at Kyogamisaki Communications Site (KCS) and Site 4a AN/TPY-2 Forward Based Mode (FBM) radar sites to ensure compliance with DoDI 8510.01 Risk Management Framework.
3. 

Performed DOTMLPF analysis of GMD software version GS7A prior to hardware/software fielding.  GS7A software represents a major redesign and upgrade of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. Post GS7A fielding, conducted DOTMLPF analysis on Warfighter impacts from the development and fielding of a GFC 7A dot build implementing a new buffer zone paradigm.

ICW 100 MD BDE and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), identified requirements for and conducted a trade study the GMD Conduct of Fire Trainer (GCOFT) development effort.  MDA has since issued a Task Instruction to Boeing Corporation to develop Courses of Action and cost estimates addressing documented Warfighter's training deficiencies.

ICW MDA and USNORTHCOM, ensured Warfighter requirements were considered and included in the development of four construction packages required for the build-out of a new missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska (Missile Field 4), which will host an additional 20 interceptors, bringing the GMD inventory from 44 to 64 by 2024.

Developed and fielded an Army-specific C2BMC Planner Employment Concept.  The concept was subsequently validated at the MDA-sponsored Planning Exercise (PLANEX) in EUCOM in Aug 18.

Worked in concert with MDA to establish the requirement for a Military GMD System Trainer (GST) Operator Course.  The course was developed by Boeing and transitioned to SMDC for presentation to the Warfighter.  This course trains soldiers to operate the GST in the absence of prime contractor computer system operators, increasing training opportunities for the Warfighter.

Worked with MDA during the development of two unique AN/TPY-2 FBM Planner prototypes.  ICW MDA, developed the Military Utility Assessment (MUA) criteria and a FBM Planner Employment Concept.  Participated in EUCOM-centric MUA in Sep 2018 and will participate in INDOPACOM-centric MUA now scheduled for Jan 2019.

Developed and delivered Army requirements for an AN/TPY-2 FBM-specific training device to be developed by MDA.   Device must support individual and crew training and certification on FBM unique tasks through tables IV and VIII.

Completed commercial power project at the Kyogamisaki Communications Site (KCS) greatly reducing noise and improving Host Nation relations.

Completed contractor to Soldier conversion at FBM Site 512 in Israel.

                                        <r2:Text>1) Joint Embedded Messaging System (JEMS) Support to Army Experimentation - SMDC DSD supported Unified Challenge 18.3 providing Joint Embedded Messaging System (JEMS) support across the breadth of the event.  In order to support Mission Command, the SMDC BLCSE Node used JEMS to convert and communicate with all Mission Command systems.  JEMS monitored Blue force simulation messaging and turned that data into tactical messages used by the Command Post of the Future (CPoF).   Also, JEMS was used to fill intelligence reporting gaps providing some level of situational awareness to military role players.  JEMS also monitored health status of select Red force targets as those targets were neutralized and indicated those targets were destroyed (to mission command).
2) The Future Force Experimentation Air Defense Simulation (FFEADS) was installed in the SMDC S3I SiL to assist with HEL Studies and Analysis.  Also, FFEADS was used in support of Unified Challenge (UC-18.2) at the Fires Battle Lab by providing conceptual IAMD Weapons and C2 systems for the environment.  The simulation supported sites at Fires Battle Lab, Ft. Benning Lab, Ft. Rucker Lab and Ft. Leonardwood Lab and provided the only IAMD Tool for the environment and C2 system at multiple sites and echelons.  RTOS and FFEADS were used to test conceptual systems to battle the enemy of the future and determine how Commanders would utilize those capabilities.
Supported Nimble Fire 18A &amp; 18B at the JIAMDO Virtual Warfare Center supporting with conceptual IAMD Weapons and C2 systems. (JXX, LTAMDS and IAMD Integration).  Utilized the models to test conceptual systems to battle the enemy of the future and determine how Commanders would utilize those capabilities in a Joint Community.  Also tested Kill Chain procedures between Joint Systems and C2 authority.  Supported Agile Cutlass for JXX Advanced Engagement Concept (AEC) testing between the Marines and Army.  This was to test AEC concept between Army and Joint sensors and shooters.  FFEADS was installed at the US Air Force Distributed Missions Operations Center (DMOC) at Kirkland AFB, to replicate Patriot, THAAD, Threat Generation and IAMD C2 Operations.  This was to assist with Joint Kill Chain Events, Virtual Flag and other studies and exercises.  Software is supporting SMDC down select for the HEL-TVD Program where we are proposing to utilize a version of Integrated Fire Command and Control Environment (IFC2E) as a new system called BMC3 (Battle Management Command Control and Communications).

Provided simulation support to the IAMDC Abu Dhabi:  ? HawkEX ? Supported with Hawk Simulation, Patriot Simulation and THAAD Simulation.
? Falcon Shield ? Supported with Hawk, Patriot, THAAD and IFC2E ? Desert Flag - Supported with Hawk, Patriot, THAAD and IFC2E ? Moved consoles from IAMDC to Al Dhafra

3) Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM) was used to support a wide range of internal SMDC Studies and Analysis efforts to include Military Utility of HE Laser against UAV/ISR (SMDC), Adversary Centric Plans Assessment '18 (JFCC-IMD), Allied Partner Modeling Study-AMD, Directed Energy Analysis (SMDC), IBCS Capabilities Production  Document  II  (PEO-MS), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD)  Optimization (SMDC), EUCOM /CENTCOM Force Mix Analysis (JFCC-IMD), Upper/Lower Tier Regional Analysis (MDA), Joint Regional IAMD Capability Mix II (Joint Staff), Holistic Missile Defense (JFCC-IMD), and Allied Partner Modeling Study-AMD II (SMDC).

Additionally, EADSIM is being used by the SMDC Technical Center to virtually demonstrate the capabilities of the two competing High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL TVD) contractors.   Funding resourced EADSIM modifications needed to support this effort.  

EADSIM replaced DESIM in DTS S/S 6.4   DTS S/S is used to train the C2BMC crew.

Missile Defense Agency DTWX began using EADSIM to replace DESIM for modeling upper and lower tier BMDS systems in CCMD exercises.

EADSIM was used by Aegis BMD in an operator in the loop capability to support assessments of Pre-Planned Responses (PPR) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  Aegis BMD Block 5.1 capabilities were funded and implemented in 2018.   EADSIM was also used by Aegis for CCMD exercises over VACCSIM.

USSTRATCOM J5 and J8 used EADSIM for operational planning, ISR, and electronic warfare.  Most recent letter of support attached.

EADSIM was successfully used to identify, test, and refine courses of action for defending the Northern Approaches against air and missile threats in the FY18 Vista Rampart (VR) Wargame. 

EADSIM provided modeling capability for a new classified Army sensor, which will be used to demonstrate the sensor in CCMD events.

Completed CEMA enhancements in EADSIM to support analysis and experimentation.  The enhancements will increase the level of detail in EADSIM's EW modeling capabilities particularly in jamming and sensors.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Beginning in FY 2020, the Army Long-Range Persistent Surveillance (ALPS) system efforts transition to Program Element 0604741A, Project 126.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Funding in this Program Element (PE) supports Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) efforts to conduct operational realistic assessments of Army Air and Missile Defense (AMD) performance, identify system vulnerabilities, and develop mitigations against threats across the Cyber and Electromagnetic spectrum. Army AMD sensors, integrated air and missile defense mission command and fire control, Radio Frequency (RF) data and voice networks, and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) technology will be assessed against current and postulated threat systems and techniques. Potential solutions developed by the Army, other Services, and Defense agencies (for example Missile Defense Agency) to close identified gaps will be demonstrated and assessed in live and simulated CEMA environments. Assessment events will be conducted approximately every two years.  Implementation of potential solutions will occur between events using system-specific funding. The proposed solutions will then be assessed at the next event after implementation.

Included in this line are funds to plan and execute periodic CEMA activities with Army AMD systems, to include other Service and other Agency AMD systems as appropriate.  Upon completion of CEMA demonstration analyses, funding will facilitate initial recommendations for potential mitigations and solutions to Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data link vulnerabilities. Efforts in this program will also develop tools for use by Army AMD systems to improve overall system performance in contested environments, to include effects-based CEMA Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) to assess Army AMD CEMA concepts in Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) environment. Additionally, virtual models of critical hardware and software are being developed and implemented to allow for destructive testing with advanced CEMA threats in a lab environment. There will be continual interface with intelligence communities to maintain cognizance of emerging CEMA threats and incorporate these threats in future CEMA demonstrations. These activities follow a time-phased roadmap that identifies the investments needed to improve the resiliency of Army AMD sensors, C2, and RF data and voice networks in contested CEMA environments. 

FY 2020 funding of $15.648 million will be used to analyze P-12 event data, provide recommendations for rapid countermeasures and potential solutions, conduct destructive CEMA lab events, continue virtualization of additional AMD system of systems architecture for future CEMA assessments against advanced destructive cyber and electromagnetic threats. Funding will also be used to initiate planning and preparation for the P-13 event.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Concept Exploration and Refinement of Terrain Shaping Obstacles and develops alternatives to the Family of Scatterable Mines systems.

Project 606 enables component development of a new detection capability for explosive hazards, improvised explosive devices (IED), and components in support of route clearance operations.  These capabilities will enhance the effectiveness of the Route Clearance Platoon within the Engineer Company, the Brigade Combat Team as well as with other related Army missions.

Project BU5 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) provides an interim Anti-Vehicle (AV) capability to address the Army's directed close tactical obstacle capability gap. FY 2020 funding resources the initiation of the SAVO program. SAVO supports a U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) as well as a revision to the Multiple Delivery Mine System (Volcano) Joint Service Operational Requirement (JSOR). This capability will allow for the formation of pre-emplaced directed obstacles that can be initiated remotely via fielded wired or wireless initiation systems. If the emplaced obstacle is not initiated, SAVO can be recovered for future re-deployment. SAVO consists of a newly developed base from which the existing stock of National Landmine Policy compliant munitions (M87A1 Volcano canisters) can be launched. SAVO can be initiated through an interface with three fielded systems; the M7 Spider Networked Munition System, the MK152/M156 Remote Activation Munition Systems (RAMS), or the CD450-4J Blasting Machine.

Project EK7 Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  The obstacles will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battle space.  Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement and to actively detect and engage the enemy at all operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system and modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 606 Countermine/Barrier Advanced Development enables development and evaluation of technologies that will perform detection, neutralization, and clearing of landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at operational speeds. 

The Forward Reconnaissance and Explosive Hazard Detection (FREHD) system is a suite of four capabilities for use by route clearance patrols to provide standoff detection of explosive hazards:  vehicle-mounted anomaly detection; pinpoint explosive hazard detection; explosive hazard vapor and particle detection; and remote visualization.  FREHD increases the rate of advance of the route clearance formation while removing Soldiers and equipment from the proximity of blast and fragmentation.

There are no FY 2020 Base Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) funds requested for this project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach that delivers capability to the Warfighter by leveraging the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) currently deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). In FY 2018, as part Engineering Development activities, the program will execute an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to add a wire detection capability to address evolving threat, and Infrared illumination to enable nighttime operation. A second ECP to improve operational availability of the HMDS during inclement weather and address obsolescence and Cyber Security deficiencies will follow. As part of the Advanced Development activities, the HMDS Program will conduct additional development and evaluation of technologies to address a broader spectrum of emerging threats, interoperability with electronic countermeasures, and detection and neutralization of landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at operational speeds.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This is a new start project starting in FY 2020. Project BU5 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) provides an interim Anti-Vehicle (AV) capability to address the Army's directed close tactical obstacle capability gap. FY 2020 funding resources the initiation of the SAVO program. SAVO supports a U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) as well as a revision to the Multiple Delivery Mine System (Volcano) Joint Service Operational Requirement (JSOR). This capability will allow for the formation of pre-emplaced directed obstacles that can be initiated remotely via fielded wired or wireless initiation systems. If the emplaced obstacle is not initiated, SAVO can be recovered for future re-deployment. SAVO consists of a newly developed base from which the existing stock of National Landmine Policy compliant munitions (M87A1 Volcano canisters) can be launched. SAVO can be initiated through an interface with three fielded systems; the M7 Spider Networked Munition System, the MK152/M156 Remote Activation Munition Systems (RAMS), or the CD450-4J Blasting Machine.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development of Terrain Shaping Obstacles.

Area Denial Capability Development will evaluate integrated technologies and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment to expedite technology transition for Terrain Shaping Obstacles.  The obstacles will deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace.  Area Denial Capability Development provides controlled scalable effects against mounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, delay or block their ability to maneuver.  Area Denial Capability Development enables the Combatant Commander to shape the battle space without exposing friendly forces to enemy engagement and to actively detect and engage the enemy at all operational ranges.  Area Denial Capability Development will utilize an open system and modular architecture to facilitate future development, maintenance, repair, and product improvements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Dominating Mobility Through Terrain Shaping and Engagement (DMTTS&amp;E) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) on 3 October 2014.  The DMTTS&amp;E ICD documents Terrain Shaping Obstacle (TSO) capabilities at all operational ranges including those within line-of-sight and those that are beyond line-of-sight.  The Army awarded four concept prototype contracts/agreements to develop representative prototypes (hardware and/or models) which were used to assess the TSO concepts, technical risks, and costs of potential munitions systems and associated capabilities. The Army has awarded two initiatives to develop representative prototypes of top attack munitions to assess concept feasibility, maturity and technical risk. The Army intends to develop the TSO munitions system and associated capabilities. The TSO system will eventually be packaged into various delivery methods for employment at all operational ranges; however, the Army plans to initially develop and field the TSO capability at close operational ranges. The Army intends to competitively award up to two Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contracts/agreements in FY 2019 to develop competing prototypes of the TSO munitions and associated capabilities, which includes close-range delivery mechanisms.  As the munitions system matures, the items will be available for integration into additional delivery methods for employment across the entire range of operations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Screening Obscuration Module (SOM) will increase platform survivability and soldier protection levels of maneuver forces by degrading enemy forces ability to detect US targets.  The use of battlefield obscuration is a time-tested military tactic to protect personnel, vehicles, equipment, and structures from detection; and to screen the locations, activities, and actions of friendly forces. Commanders who employ obscuration enjoy greater tactical success, freedom of maneuver, and force protection. The SOM assists the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) in retaining freedom of maneuver, conducting breaching operations, breaking contact with the enemy during security operations, and deceiving the enemy of the BCT's intentions. The SOM accomplishes this by degrading enemy forces ability to detect US targets in the visual and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The SOM will provide a man portable mountable and dismountable medium area visual screening obscuration capability that can be applied to manned combat platforms and unmanned robotic systems. The individual Soldier or team will employ the SOM devices on open and complex terrain as part of cross-domain obscuration effects synchronized with land and air maneuver during cross-domain windows of advantage. 

JUONS CC-0557 provides an enhanced early warning, detection, and identification of Chemical Warfare Agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) to existing integrated base defense systems.  These capabilities are in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and will be fully integrated into the Integrated Base Defense-Kits at 10 Forward Operating Bases in Iraq.

Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Integrated Early Warning (IEW) requirements detailed in PACOM ONS 17-22580 (HQDA validated in Jan 2018). The capability developed in support of ONS 17-22580, will provide enhancements and integrated CBRN defense sensors to provide early warning of CBRN attacks and events, supplemented with decision support software. Increasing the level of confidence of information to the Commander, facilitating their ability to make critical, time sensitive decisions with high confidence and low regret to mitigate and manage the impacts of CBRN hazards.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2020, Program Element 0603639A, Project EU3, 50 Caliber All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge (APTC), is a New Start.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program Element (PE) encompasses a comprehensive program to develop, rapidly transition to production, and field advanced weapons and munitions for small, medium and large caliber munitions, tank ammunition, mortar ammunition, cannon artillery ammunition, and close combat system items.  These projects will ensure continued battlefield overmatch and lethality of U.S. maneuver forces against the full range of modern battlefield threats. To achieve this, the Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Program will identify and develop promising technologies through competitive development and streamlined acquisition procedures.

Project 694, Medium Caliber Ammunition: Develop 30x113mm self-destructing airburst munitions and qualify 30x113mm linked ammunition for ground vehicles. Increase precision and lethality capability to defeat personnel and materiel targets as well as support the Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON CC-0558) to counter the rapidly evolving threat of Unmanned Aerial Systems. This effort will qualify the links for use with existing M788 and M789 ammunition and develop self-destructing and airburst capable munitions fired from the Lightweight 30x113mm Link Fed Chain Gun.  There is no funding requested in FY 2020.

Project BQ4, 155mm Artillery Propulsion XM654: The XM654E2 Supercharge is a unitary top-zone 155mm propelling charge optimized and required for use with 58-caliber XM907E2 Extended Range Cannon with Slide-block breech for use with the XM1299 Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Self-propelled Howitzer (SPH).  It will achieve lethality overmatch at ranges of approximately 70km from XM907E2 Extended Range Cannon with developmental extended range projectiles, and will increase range with legacy projectiles by thirty percent.  The XM654E2 Supercharge is composed of combustible cases with integral metal Stub Case utilizing existing electrically initiated Tank Primer and advanced artillery propellant.  Knowledge points will determine compatibility with automated ammunition handling systems.  FY 2020 funds will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation towards Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support ERCA SPH Increment 2 to support of the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project EB8, OWL for Small Caliber: The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges. FY 2020 funding supports continued testing and evaluation of the 5.56mm OWL prototype solutions in order to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL).

Project EB9, Aviation Airborne Expandable Countermeasures: This project supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform program managers and with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0558 Counter - Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS). Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy. This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified. Conduct initial developmental/operational testing on XM215 and RF Countermeasures (CM).

Project EC2, The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) which outlines the requirements for new ammunition to support the rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under Section 804 Authority.   New ADVAP ammunition is designed to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.  The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158.  

The Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition has a similar objective to the 7.62mm ADVAP which is to defeat hard targets.  The NGSW ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP).  The nomenclature for the GP ammunition is XM1186 and the nomenclature for the SP ammunition is XM1184.  The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm.  

FY 2020 funding supports continuing rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) Special Purpose (SP) projectile, building prototypes and maturing prototypes to provide to the weapon system contractors for performance evaluation, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), and conducting prototype testing.  FY 2020 funding also supports conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the SP projectile and performing activities to increase prototype capacity to support planned weapon system testing.


Project EC3, Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2020 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system. FY 2020 funding will also be used to continue verification testing of a type two prototype next generation temperature/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.

Project EL7, Reduced Range Ammunition: The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of Reduced Range Ammunition is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. Reduce Range Ammunition  will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the surface danger zone. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The Reduced Range Ammunition cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  There is no funding requested in FY 2020.

Project EL8, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber: The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The goal of the LSCA Project is to reduce the total Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight. The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition Project will develop and field 7.62mm lightweight small caliber ammunition cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges. The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun. No funding requested in FY 2020.

Project EU3, .50 Caliber All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge (APTC): The All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge (APTC) project is a critical technology development in response to the .50 caliber Munitions Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge is to deliver a single round that replaces and improves current legacy .50 caliber ammunition. The All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge will be compatible with all Army .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M2 Machine Guns. FY 2020 funding supports Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) in preparation for a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, conducting a Materiel Development Decision (MDD), and conducting Design Verification Tests.

Project FA5, The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) -FA5 Project is focused on advanced risk mitigation, technology integration, prototyping, and product support to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems within a complex system of systems environment. The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping that increase lethality and ensure future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer/near-peer adversaries as well as improving program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code GPS coordinated efforts. The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions Project directly supports Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  Funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS and Army's Assured PNT programs. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, and maturation of alternative positioning, navigation and timing related technologies to enable informed Assured PNT related program of record milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions.

Project FG1, Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM): The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project is a two increment approach to provide U.S. ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area. An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018. The purpose of the C-DAEM AoA was to inform acquisition and investment decisions by the Army regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with Department of Defense policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements identified in the C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). The Army validated a two increment solution for C-DAEM. Increment I will destroy infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks. Increment II will destroy personnel, materiel, air defense artillery and rocket launchers. Increment I and II will be developed simultaneously. FY 2020 resources will fund the competitive demonstrations for Increment I, as well as early detailed design testing supporting the qualification of Increment II to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project XT5, 30mm Anti-Personnel and Counter UAS: Lightweight 30x113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6.  The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the Warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.  There is no funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The XM654E2 Supercharge is a unitary top-zone 155mm propelling charge optimized and required for use with 58-caliber XM907E2 Extended Range Cannon with Slide-block breech for use with the XM1299 Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) Self-propelled Howitzer (SPH).  It will achieve lethality overmatch at ranges of approximately 70km from XM907E2 Extended Range Cannon with developmental extended range projectiles, and will increase range with legacy projectiles by thirty percent.  The XM654E2 Supercharge is composed of combustible cases with integral metal Stub Case utilizing existing electrically initiated Tank Primer and advanced artillery propellant.  Knowledge points will determine compatibility with automated ammunition handling systems.  FY 2020 funds will support design risk reduction and prototype maturation towards Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) to support ERCA SPH Increment 2 and in support of the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2019, Budget Activity 4 (BA4) Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EB8, 7.62mm OWL transitions to Budget Activity 5 (BA5) PE 0604802A, Project EP4, 7.62mm OWL.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 caliber munitions CDD.  Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter.  The OWL project's objective is to develop and field a full day/night tracer round to replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability.  7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus followed by a similar development strategy for .50 caliber cartridges. FY 2020 funding supports continued testing and evaluation of the 5.56mm OWL prototype solutions in order to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) technology will be integrated into the M80A1 trace ammunition production.  The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts. A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was conducted in FY 2015 and FY 2016 to measure the progress of the designs. The FY 2017 and FY 2018 TRAs were conducted to evaluate the Industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with the 7.62mm Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in FY 2019. The 5.56mm and .50 caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) scheduled to commence in FY 2021 for the 5.56mm variant. The new 5.56mm tracer cartridges will replace the legacy 5.56mm M856A1 tracer.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the advanced development activities and technology demonstrations of the Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasure (AAECM). These advanced decoys are necessary to address emerging threats and capabilities deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. These efforts will evaluate integrated technologies and countermeasure prototype systems in realistic operating test environments. Prototypes will help expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use by demonstrating component and subsystem maturity prior to integration into major and complex Army aircraft platforms. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army RDT&amp;E efforts are coordinated with the PEO Aviation and its platform PMs with PM Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to address emerging Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0558 Counter - Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS).  Continue to develop and prepare documentation for Milestone A decision for the Radar Guided decoy. This decoy is designed to defeat specific threat types. Details of their operation is classified. Conduct initial developmental/operational testing on XM215 and RF Countermeasures (CM).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) technology has been under development since 2015 and applies to multiple calibers of ammunition.  In FY 2017, the funding transitioned from Budget Activity (BA) 04 Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EC2 to BA 05, PE 0604802A, Project EP5, Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) for Small Cal Ammo to continue the development of ADVAP 7.62mm ammunition.  A follow-on effort to support ADVAP ammunition calibers below 7.62mm commences in FY 2019 under the BA 4, PE 0603639A, Project EC2 Adv Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) Small Cal Ammo.  In FY 2021, PE 0603639A, Project EC2, ADVAP will be re-aligned to PE 0604601 Project EV9 prior to the PB 2021 submission to continue development efforts on ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm.  The effort is not a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Armor-Piercing (ADVAP) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and 5.56mm Family of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) which outlines the requirements for new ammunition to support the rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under Section 804 Authority.   New ADVAP ammunition is designed to provide overmatch capability to defeat advanced light armored threats within typical machine gun engagement ranges.  The nomenclature for the 7.62mm ADVAP is XM1158.  

The Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition has a similar objective to the 7.62mm ADVAP which is to defeat hard targets.  The NGSW ammunition is split into two initial variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP).  The nomenclature for the GP ammunition is XM1186 and the nomenclature for the SP ammunition is XM1184.  The overall objective of the ADVAP project is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) both 7.62mm XM1158 cartridge for the M240 machine gun and ADVAP ammunition in calibers below 7.62mm.  

FY 2020 funding supports continuing rapid prototyping/development of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) Special Purpose (SP) projectile, building prototypes and maturing prototypes to provide to the weapon system contractors for performance evaluation, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), and conducting prototype testing.  FY 2020 funding also supports conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the SP projectile and performing activities to increase prototype capacity to support planned weapon system testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ADVAP ammunition programs will use a Government developed design and manufacturing process. Multiple component contracts will be awarded to purchase raw materials and equipment. In FY 2016, the ADVAP effort accomplished design optimization, manufactured prototypes, and demonstrated TRL 6 for XM1158. Milestone (MS) B occurred in 1st Quarter FY 2017 leading to fabrication and testing of qualification hardware for the 7.62mm cartridge.  Follow-on developmental efforts for the ADVAP ammunition calibers below 7.62mm will utilize rapid prototyping acquisition strategy under Section 804 Authority.  The project will utilize Government developed projectile designs that will be delivered to development contractors as Government Furnished Material (GFM).  The Government will select up to three contractors for the weapon system development and down-select to a single contractor in FY 2021, prior to production contract award.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers.  These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield.  Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization.  The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield.  This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  FY 2020 funding will be used to complete verification testing and an operational demonstration for the environmental health monitoring system.  FY 2020 funding will also be used to continue verification testing of a type two prototype next generation temperature/humidity sensor with batch interrogation and historical data retention capabilities, which will be used for assessing munitions reliability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) technology applies to multiple calibers. As the technology matures in FY 2019, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL7, Reduced Range Ammunition for the 7.62mm variant transitions to PE 0604802A, Project EP3, Reduced Range Ammunition - Small Caliber. In FY 2020, the .50 Caliber variant will transition from PE 0603639A, Project EL7 to PE 0604802A, Project EP3.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions.  The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas.  RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ.  This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges.  The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns.  There is no funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) cartridge case technology will be applied to multiple calibers. The project involves developing and qualifying lightweight cartridge case, starting with 7.62mm ammunition, to replace current brass cartridge case. In FY 2019, Program Element (PE) 0603639A, Project EL8, Lightweight Cartridge Case for Small Caliber transitions to PE 0607131A, Project ER6, Direct Fire Technology.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lightweight Small Caliber Ammunition (LSCA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62mm Capabilities Development Documents (CDD).  The goal of the LSCA Project is to reduce the total Soldier load through reduction in ammunition weight.  The LSCA Project will develop and field 7.62mm LSCA cartridges that will provide the same capabilities as the M80A1 and M62A1 cartridges.  The LSCA cartridge will be designed to be compatible with all Army 7.62mm weapon systems, but optimized to work in the M240 Machine Gun.  No funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2021, the project will transition to Budget Activity 05 (BA05) Program Element (PE) 0604802A, Project EU5, .50 Caliber All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge (APTC) to continue development work and support Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge (APTC) project is a critical technology development in response to the .50 caliber Munitions Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge is to deliver a single round that replaces and improves current legacy .50 caliber ammunition.  The All-Purpose Tactical Cartridge will be compatible with all Army .50 caliber weapons but specifically optimized to work in the M2 Machine Guns. FY 2020 funding supports Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) in preparation for a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, conducting a Materiel Development Decision (MDD), and conducting Design Verification Tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions (APWM) -FA5 Project is focused on advanced risk mitigation, technology integration, prototyping, and product support to identify, evaluate, mature, test, and demonstrate various assured precision prototype technologies in weapon and munitions components and subsystems within a complex system of systems environment. The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions Project reinforces the National Defense Strategy's major lines of effort through technology development and prototyping that increase lethality and ensure future combat overmatch success of the Joint Force against peer/near-peer adversaries as well as improving program performance and affordability for multiple weapons and munitions Programs of Record (PoRs) via Joint Lethality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and Army M-Code GPS coordinated efforts. The Assured Precision Weapons and Munitions Project directly supports Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.  Funding will support engagement by Weapons and Munitions PNT experts in the development, evaluation, and technology delivery activities of the Air Force's M-Code GPS and Army's Assured PNT programs. Funding will also enable component and subsystem architecture input essential for precision weapons and munitions operating in a system of-systems environment, Army M-Code GPS technology integration and evaluation, and maturation of alternative positioning, navigation and timing related technologies to enable informed Assured PNT related program of record milestone and Army cross-functional modernization decisions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM) Project is a two increment approach to provide U.S. ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018.  The purpose of the C-DAEM AoA was to inform acquisition and investment decisions by the Army regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with DoD policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements identified in the C-DAEM Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).  The Army validated a two increment solution for C-DAEM.  Increment I will destroy infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks.  Increment II will destroy personnel, materiel, air defense artillery and rocket launchers.  Increment I and II will be developed simultaneously.  FY 2020 resources will fund the competitive demonstrations for Increment I, as well as early detailed design testing supporting the qualification of Increment II to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>In FY 2021, this Project will transition to Budget Activity 05, PE 0604802A Project FJ4, Cannon-Delivered Area Effects Munitions (C-DAEM).  A Procurement Ammunition, Army C-DAEM funding line will be established in FY 2023.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-DAEM will employ an evolutionary acquisition approach to efficiently transition the unique ammunition products as they become available.  The Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed on 31 January 2018 qualified a dramatic enhancement of operational Fires effectiveness, efficiency, and maneuver support when cannon artillery was equipped with a dedicated extended range, anti-armor projectile.  In FY 2019, C-DAEM is reducing risk by beginning prototype testing and evaluation in parallel to decomposing the AoA results into selection criteria.  C-DAEM will use the selection criteria to sponsor a competitive demonstration for this first increment (medium to heavy armor) to streamline the acquisition process by leveraging Section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2016.  C-DAEM will use the Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to commission the demonstration phase in FY 2020.  For following increments to address personnel to medium armored targets, C-DAEM will use DOTC OTA to execute risk reduction testing in FY 2020 in parallel to the Increment I demonstrations.  C-DAEM will then be in position to proceed to qualification testing of the next promising candidates to update plans for the next capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Lightweight 30x113mm (LW30) Airburst is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Production Document (CPD), AH-64E Helicopter, Increment 1, Version 6.  The LW30 airburst cartridge improves the ability of the warfighter to effectively engage anti-personnel/materiel targets due to increased lethality. Airburst capability provides the user with a much higher probability of achieving a first burst kill against enemy personnel targets in the open. The LW30 will retain its dual purpose warhead, allowing it to continue to defeat light armored threats through point detonation. The cartridge provides increased lethal effects against personnel and soft-skin vehicular targets increasing Soldier Survivability on the ground during troops in contact engagements and decreases the required number of rounds to reach the desired lethal effects.  There is no funding requested in FY 2020.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Prototyping provides focused investment for the development of combat vehicles for future battlefields.  The purpose of this Program Element's (PE) funding is to integrate the next generation of technology enabled capabilities developed in the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio to demonstrate new capabilities to meet emerging military needs, provide hardware for Soldier operational experiment/feedback, determine integration potential across the current Army portfolio of ground vehicles, and develop platform level prototypes.  The primary efforts in this line include maturing and experimenting with Manned Un-Manned Teaming (in conjunction with Robotic Combat Vehicle) and maturing and experimenting with a variety of technologies that could potentially be added to the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) or legacy combat vehicles (such as Abrams and Bradley) in future incremental upgrades.  

Prototyping allows for aggressive innovation (provides a bridge from S&amp;T investment to vehicle integration and operational use), informs requirements through User Evaluations, ensures requirements are met, mitigates capability gaps and reduces integration risks. The strategy for NGCV will be to focus on delivering incremental experimental prototypes to the warfighter to demonstrate Manned Un-Manned Teaming (MUM-T) in conjunction with Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCV), to integrate technologies to maintain overmatch while demonstrating crew task reductions through crew augmentation enabled by optimized Warfighter Machine Interface (WMI) and sensor fusion.

Additionally, funding will support concept development, trade studies, technical/operational/affordability analyses to assess future concepts and designs for the Next Generation Tank (NGT). The analysis of these concepts will assist in targeting and maturing the correct S&amp;T technologies to provide the next generation capabilities to the warfighter. This funding will also support the integration of a powertrain system in a high fidelity and realistic operating environment to buy back lost mobility due to increased combat vehicle platform weight. The effort will be focused on maturation of the engine and transmission for production. In addition, this funding will support technology maturation, integration risk reduction, and qualification of key lethality/weapon system and sensor technologies to support current and future increments of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The prototype is utilizing latest off-the shelf technologies and have the capability to upgrade to the Combat Vehicle Prototyping (CVP) technologies as they become available. Acceleration of the contract will require modification of the current contract.

NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT)/PM is using the OTA to submit a call for white papers to Industry for concepts that will show technologies that will improve a combat vehicle (IFV or Tank) in the areas of mobility, survivability, lethality, situational awareness, sensor fusion and demonstrate a path to autonomy. The white papers will be used to award 1 to 2 contracts to build a prototype which will be delivered by 1Q FY2021. Information from the prototypes (both organic and from Industry), along with the parallel modeling and simulation will inform the development of the NGCV requirements.

Demonstrating Sensor Fusion/Crew Station requirements for manned and unmanned systems. Continuing to provide integration support and technology procurement for the software system integration laboratory (SIL). Providing integration support and user evaluation for the crew station SIL. These SILs will allow the integration team to simulate integrated system functionality prior to the actual physical integration of the system. Work performed in these SILs is critical to the successful mitigation of risk for the integrated systems experimentation by identifying any system integration-related errors as early as possible. Identifying errors early in the integration process will allow the team to develop solutions in a timely and effective manner. Continuing to mature the system level integration of the powerpack (engine, transmission, integrated starter generator, exhaust, air inlet, and thermal management system) along with working new projects in the areas of sensor fusion, which may include, but not limited to, data inputs from Global Positioning System (GPS), Light Detection and Raging (LIDAR), SOund Navigation And Ranging (SONAR), RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR), optical Infrared, UltraViolet (UV), etc. Procuring specialty tooling and long-lead items, and continuing to provide software support that is needed for system integration, for the accelerated experimentation.</r2:Text>

Efforts funded in this Project support all four Services, the Special Operations Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency.  The Army serves as the Executive Agent for this Department of Defense (DoD) program, with oversight and coordination provided by the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Board as required by DoD Directive (DoDD) 3235.02E. Centralized execution of the DoD Combat Feeding Research and Engineering Program (CFREP) with Joint Service review and approval eliminates unnecessary duplication of efforts across the Services and maximizes use of common materiel solutions. Prototypes validated within this effort transition to 0604713A/Project 548 for System Development and Demonstration.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The REF FY 2020 RDT&amp;E request is $2.793 million (Base) and $3.000 million (OCO) and is for system integration, testing, and evaluation to support project requirements

The REF is the Army's Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) with the ability to acquire, integrate and sustain Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS), Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), and Non-Standard Equipment (NSE) solutions to meet urgent combat requirements for globally employed forces.  It inserts selected future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate materiel solutions into deployed, deploying, select-prepared to deploy, and transformational forces for operational evaluation, assessment, and evolutionary development.  The REF assesses the provided capabilities to improve future solutions to inform materiel development for the future Army capability requirements and to potentially transition the capability to an Army acquisition program.

The REF is an enduring organization (Base funded) per Memorandum, Under Secretary of the Army, 30 Jan 2014, subject:  Implementation Plan for Stabilization of the Rapid Equipping Force (REF).

The REF bridges the gap between the Army's traditional acquisition process and immediate equipping needs.  The REF pursues tangible solutions that can be equipped rapidly with a goal of 180 days.  The REF focuses on finding immediate and effective game-changing capabilities to increase Soldier Readiness, effectiveness, protection, and lethality in any operational environment.  The REF 10-Liner process provides the ability to react quickly to an ever-changing enemy who changes in days and months, not years in a complex world.  The REF coordinates with the Combatant Command (COCOMs) and Army Service Component Command (ASCCs) in theater to fully understand their urgent needs, for which the REF acquisition capability may identify, procure, deliver, and sustain solutions to the deployed units.  Although the REF works directly with Operational Commanders at all levels, it focuses on Brigade level and below to equip solutions to identified capability gaps.

The Army Acquisition Executive designated Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier as the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to institutionalize the acquisition authorities in support of the REF and to provide proper acquisition oversight while enhancing visibility of these efforts.  The MDA will ensure flexibility and speed focused on the Soldier's needs serviced by the dedicated REF Program Management Office (PMO).  This establishes a formal acquisition reporting chain that leverages existing reporting venues to ensure appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) visibility, oversight, and direction.  

The REF capabilities cross all Warfighter Functions:
1.	Mission Command
2.	Movement and Maneuver
3.	Intelligence 
4.	Fires
5.	Sustainment
6.	Protection 

The RDT&amp;E funding also provides the REF the flexibility to invest in near-term, and innovative solutions.  RDT&amp;E funds are necessary in the majority of all REF projects.  Most importantly, REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to conduct safety certification (testing) for non-standard equipment before it is equipped to the Soldier.  This critical requirement exists to ensure that REF-provided equipment is safe for Soldiers to use and that any risks are identified and documented.  The REF also requires RDT&amp;E funds to integrate several different COTS/GOTS and NDI technologies into one capability that solves the tougher and more complex problems.  RDT&amp;E funds maybe used to further develop high (>6) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) systems or advanced technologies in conjunction with industry and Other Governmental Agencies (OGAs).  Frequently, these technologies only need small amounts of funding to help them achieve a maturity level that is suitable to solve deployed U.S. Army Forces problems.  

The REF requires RDT&amp;E funds to modify, test, and evaluate existing technologies that were developed for one purpose, however may be suitable to solve another problem.  REF will also fund deliberate projects in support of technology-solution-scouting to meet anticipated Army needs and to mitigate operational gaps.  These efforts measure and identify current technologies, and provide information to better inform Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and other communities of interest, with the intent of enlightening future Army requirements.  Example efforts that may require RDTE include the following projects:  Tactical Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and communications systems; tactical and small Combat Out Post/Forward Operating Base (COP/FOB) Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Force Protection systems; Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS); Electronic Warfare (EW) systems; Non-Tactical Vehicles (NTV); Persistent Duration UAS, and Subterranean (SubT) Operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The REF anticipates increased uncertainty regarding the future of OIR and other operations in the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) requiring additional flexibility to develop technological solutions supporting the reduced numbers of Soldiers operating globally in order to fill force protection gaps in the face of a smaller and more lethal terrorism threat.  The REF expects to continue our engagement with the ASCCs in order to address capability gaps generated by geographical and environmental constraints and improve our understanding of evolving threats and operating conditions within the respective ASCC areas of operations. The REF also expects to play a much more deliberate role in providing support to the Global Response Force (GRF) as they prepare for a wider range of response missions.  In accordance with REF?s participation in the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) led quick reaction capability effort, the Army determined the REF would provide the Army?s warm base capability at ~600 (Base/OCO) requirements in FY18 and beyond.

For FY18 the REF projects ~600 (Base/OCO) requirements in the following REF Warfighter Functions:

1.	Mission Command:   $93K (15.06%)
2.	Movement and Maneuver:  $186K (29.95%)
3.	Intelligence:  $74K  (11.98%)
4.	Fires:   $6K  (1.09%)
5.	Sustainment:  $86K (13.97%)
6.	Protection:  $172K  (27.95%)

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Rapid Equipping Force (REF) harnesses current and emerging technologies to provide rapid solutions to the urgently required capabilities of U.S. Army Forces employed globally.   The REF focus is on rapidly placing capabilities into Soldiers' hands.  This mission is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) rapidly adapting COTS/GOTS/NDI equipment to meet operational needs, and 2) developing emerging deployable capability via interaction with research and development organizations and academia.  All capabilities are safety tested prior to insertion into operational environments.  Training and sustainment are provided for every capability until it is transitioned to an approved acquisition program or terminated through an approved Army process.  Operational assessments are conducted to provide feedback in support of Army requirements generation and future capability development.  REF capabilities routinely serve as a bridge to specific ONS, JUONS, and JEONS gaps to meet urgent operational requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures.  TENCAP: (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to the Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near real-time support to contingency operations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) program serves as the Army's centralized lead to perform National Intelligence cross-agency engineering to evaluate, enhance, prototype, and transition Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies/capabilities developed by Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and other activities across the National Intelligence Community (IC) into Army systems and architectures. TENCAP: (1) ensures continued access to current National and Theater sensors and supporting tactical architectures; and (2) exploits new developments that focus on improving the Analysis and Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination and Feedback (TCPEDF) of intelligence data.  This includes efforts to: (1) shorten targeting timelines down to the Platoon level; (2) enhance target identification; (3) provide better target location (accuracy); (4) provide continued coverage of a target; and (5) develop in-theater analytic tools to enable data exploitation in near real-time support to contingency operations.  

FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $34.890 million provides: (1) engineering and collaborative development on multiple validated National Intelligence Community (IC) advanced software and prototype developments that leverage National IC investments for Army use and ensure continuous Army interoperability with National IC assets and architectures, e.g. Information Store (iStore), Scalable User-Defined Real-time GEOINT Environment (SURGE), ADV Pilot, GETS-Cedalion Transition, MERIT project management and transition; (2) Advanced Miniaturized Data Acquisition System (AMDAS) 'Next' system development; (3) advanced development of more effective intelligence collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED); (4) advanced development of capabilities for Air Vigilance (AV) Army Program of Record; and (5) development of TENCAP Radio Frequency Exploitation (TRFE) effort to support future synchronization of SIGINT, Cyber and Electronic Warfare operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP) mission is a Congressionally-mandated and chartered enduring requirement to leverage National Intelligence capabilities useful to the tactical Army.  The Army TENCAP acquisition strategy is driven by an annual TENCAP General Officer Steering Group (TGOSG), co-chaired by the Army G2, Army G8, Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology [ASA(ALT)], and includes representatives from the Army G3, Army G6, Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), and the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S).  The TGOSG reviews, validates, prioritizes, and guides Army TENCAP efforts, according to Army and Defense strategy. Based on the TGOSG guidance, Army TENCAP invests BA 6.4 RDTE in Intelligence Community (IC) developments during the more cost-effective advanced development phase to ensure Army requirements are met with minimal redundancy to Army investments.  Army TENCAP then uses BA 6.5 RDTE to manage the transition of these advanced development efforts through system development and integration into Army Programs of Record (POR).  This strategy ensures these leveraged investments remain viable through multiple budget cycles, significantly increasing successful transition to recipient Army PORs.  With acquisition discipline and oversight provided by PEO IEW&amp;S, Army TENCAP executes the TGOSG approved efforts through use of multiple contracts and agreements with the military, National Intelligence agencies, labs, industry partners and academia for the full duration required to complete development and transition these national capabilities into enduring Army programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element focuses on efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems that facilitate the development of Soldier-borne sensor devices transitioning from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide enhanced Soldier products, giving them superiority on the battlefield.

Project BQ5 (Visual Augmentation System-Advanced Development) focuses on developing the next generation vision system that provides the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi-domain environment now and tomorrow".   Funded efforts will accelerate the development of components, algorithms and demonstrations in support of the next generation day/night vision system.  Provide Rapid Target Acquisition capability with the Family of Weapon Sights-Individual and next generation End User Device (EUD), to include advanced EUD applications.  The focus is to integrate external data sources and advanced processed imagery with overlay data display.  This project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This project includes associated costs for efforts associated with integration and interface of products on the Soldiers' head, body, and weapon. This is a priority of the Secretary's Close Combat Lethality Task Force.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project VT7 (Soldier Maneuver Sensors-Advanced Development) focuses on developing integrated and enhanced products to provide the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi-domain environment now and tomorrow". Products include maneuver capabilities to detect, recognize and identify targets, and to provide target acquisition capabilities to mitigate threats prior to being engaged. The integration of higher performing multispectral sensors with smart processing will provide automatically adjusted weapon sight reticles and leverage network connectivity to enable improved situational awareness/understanding. Additional capabilities include signature management and resiliency across the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of a modular design structure for laser target acquisition applications including support for wireless data transfer, and mitigation of manned and unmanned threat sensor systems. This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This Project includes associated costs for efforts associated with integration and interface of products on the Soldiers' head, body, and weapon.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.

Project VT8 (Soldier Precision Targeting Devices - Advanced Development) focuses on developing component technologies and representative prototype systems for Soldier portable precision targeting devices to continue improvements to system performance while reducing size, weight, and power required by those systems. Efforts will improve the Soldier's ability to precisely locate and designate targets across a broader range of operating environments, including all weather conditions and GPS-contested environments. Component technology development will precede integration into specific systems and will include improved Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices; solid-state, improved lasers for range finding/designation/marking; electro-optical sensors such as infrared, near-infrared, ultra-violet, and visible spectrum imagers; sensor and data fusion; laser designator spot detection and imaging; integration of advanced power management technologies.  Funding in this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project focuses on developing integrated and enhanced products to provide the Soldier with the ability to "fight, win and survive, day and night, in a multi-domain environment now and tomorrow". Products include maneuver capabilities to detect, recognize and identify targets, and to provide target acquisition capabilities to mitigate threats prior to being engaged. The integration of higher performing multispectral sensors with smart processing will provide automatically adjusted weapon sight reticles and leverage network connectivity to enable improved situational awareness/understanding. Additional capabilities include signature management and resiliency across the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of a modular design structure for laser target acquisition applications including support for wireless data transfer, and mitigation of manned and unmanned threat sensor systems. This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative prototype systems for development of Soldier sensor devices, transitioning from the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) stage to operational use. This Project includes associated costs for efforts associated with integration and interface of products into the Soldiers' Adaptive Architecture.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>FVMC provides the next generation vision capabilities for day and night that will reduce Soldier's load and allow hands free operation. The FVMC will provide spatially-aligned imagery from the weapon sight to the heads-up display. FVMC supports Nett Warrior by fusing sensor video and data sources using smart processing to provide improved situational awareness/understanding in the Soldier vision system. The FVMC will provide day/night Rapid Target Acquisition capability by wirelessly interfacing with all variants of the Family of Weapon Sights. The FVMC will serve as the Soldier's digital platform for displaying augmented reality data. FVMC will integrate with future digital combat optics. FVMC provides capabilities that support overmatch against threats documented in the New Generation Warfare study, OSD Close Combat Strategic Portfolio Review and the Small Arms Ammunition Configuration study. These capabilities are captured in the Maneuver Force Modernization Strategy and Squad and Soldier Modernization Deep Dive strategic plans.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The LSS is the next generation weapon targeting sensor for use on the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) which provides additional situational awareness and lethality by wirelessly interfacing to other Soldier devices.  The increased LSS Soldier capabilities include providing heads up Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) though the wireless interface with the head mounted Soldier vision systems and interface to the Next Generation Rifle through the Intelligent/Powered Rail.  LSS will also interface wirelessly with the Nett Warrior End User Device (NW EUD) to exchange Mission Command information and provide through sight augmented reality for enhanced situational awareness.  Additionally, LSS will provide day and night capabilities to image in multiple spectral bands, interrogate potential targets, provide facial recognition capabilities at tactical ranges, perform target handoff, provide distance to target through laser rangefinder interface, and calculate and adjust for displaced reticule using advanced fire control algorithms.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project focuses on developing component technologies and representative prototype systems for Soldier portable precision targeting devices to continue improvements to system performance while reducing size, weight, and power required by those systems. Efforts will improve the Soldier's ability to precisely locate and designate targets across a broader range of operating environments, including all weather conditions and GPS-contested environments. Component technology development will precede integration into specific systems and will include improved Precision Azimuth and Vertical Angle Measurement (PAVAM) devices; solid-state, improved lasers for range finding/designation/marking; electro-optical sensors such as infrared, near-infrared, ultra-violet, and visible spectrum imagers; sensor and data fusion; laser designator spot detection and imaging; integration of advanced power management technologies.  Funding in this project aligns with Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>There is broad potential application for environmental quality technology (EQT) to be applied to multiple Army weapon systems and installations. However, technology must be demonstrated and validated (total ownership cost and performance data identified) before potential users will consider exploiting it. This Program Element (PE) includes Projects focused on validating the general military utility or cost reduction potential of technology when applied to different types of infrastructure, military equipment or techniques. It may include validations and proof-of-principle demonstrations in field exercises to evaluate upgrades or provide new operational capabilities. The validation of technologies will be in as realistic an operating environment as possible to assess performance or cost reduction potential. EQT demonstration/validation is systemic and applicable across Department of Army sites and installation problems (e.g. unexploded ordnance detection and discrimination). This PE supports the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment. All work is endorsed by potential users and supported by a state-of-the-art assessment to determine when the technology can transition to the user for implementation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE) was established by Congress in 1990 with a directive to "serve as a national leadership organization to address high priority environmental problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), other government organizations, and the industrial community." The NDCEE Program is a national resource for developing and disseminating advanced environmental technologies. The NDCEE is used to: demonstrate environmentally acceptable technology to industry; validate new technology prior to transferring that technology; and assist in the training of potential users as part of that technology transfer process. The NDCEE is a DoD resource for environmental quality management and technology validation. This Project is managed by the Army on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment.  In May 2008, the Project name was re-designated from the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence to the National Defense Center for Energy and Environment to ensure that the Center's mission recognizes and addresses the strategic interdependence of energy and environmental technology requirements within an overall sustainability framework in support of our installations, weapons systems and war fighters. This name change also directly supports the DoD's proactive implementation of Executive Order 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management."

The United States (U.S.) Army's broadly encompassing and growing mobile, personal and stationary advanced energy technology requirements include infrastructure, alternative and synthetic fuels, surety, renewables, storage, distribution, advanced power, micro-grids, transportation, systems integration and others. Further, to train as we fight, validated energy and environmental technologies need to be available and implemented at Army installations. The NDCEE will continue to demonstrate, validate, and transfer these technologies supporting our integrated environment, safety, occupational health and energy objectives in consideration of mission, readiness, innovation, lethality and modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Executed eighteen demonstration/validation efforts across the environment, safety, occupational health, and energy functional areas.  These projects are on target to provide valuable end products (tangible or intellectual) to transition partners, as stated in each project?s transition agreement.  Technologies transitioned this year include:
Environmental Toolkit for Expeditionary Operations (ETEO): The toolkit is an environmental technology enabling mission success in increasingly contaminated operating environments. The ETEO detects hazardous contaminants through a suite of sensors able to rapidly identify chemical and biological contaminants in air, soil and water.  The toolkit will be available to users through the Instrument Set, Reconnaissance and Surveying program of record and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reachback Operations Center. 

Live-Round Interrupter (LRI): Over the past two years, NDCEE has supported the demonstration and validation of the effectiveness of the LRI in training scenarios.  The LRI prevents loading live rounds into a weapon during blank-fire training and has the potential to save lives and prevent injuries to Soldiers.  The LRI proved successful in preventing a live round from being chambered and allowed a weapon to cycle more closely to its design when firing blank rounds.  After the successful National Training Center (NTC) demonstration, the LRI was briefed as an emerging best practice during the FORSCOM Commander's Risk Reduction Council Video Teleconference, on 13 February 2018.  FORSCOM senior leaders observed an LRI demonstration at NTC and were very pleased with its functionality.  The ODASA(ESOH) staff will work with the appropriate Army proponents to meet final compatibility and safety requirements and pursue the LRI's formal adoption as a replacement for the current Blank Fire Adapter.

NDCEE successfully transitioned the outcome of project: Replacement Refrigerant for Environmental Control Units (R438A replacement for R22), through our transition partner at Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), to support the CECOM Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) managed systems.
Sulfur Tolerant Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC): This technology improves operating capabilities of sulfur tolerant SOFCs to promote increased ground vehicle range, autonomy, and power generation for external devices. This project, which provided development of sulfur tolerant SOFCs, lays the foundation for unmanned and manned aerial vehicles? increased range and additional power for increased electronic capabilities in commercial and military applications.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NDCEE is a national asset focused on DoD applications that include technology transfer to appropriate DoD transition partners. The management strategy for the NDCEE ensures that all projects have a potential multi-service benefit and have a high potential for transition success. At the strategic level, the NDCEE Executive Advisory Board (EAB) is chaired by the DoD NDCEE Lead Agent on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and is representative of the services and DoD. The EAB and the Program Director are supported by the NDCEE Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to help ensure that NDCEE investments are maximized across DoD and the Services. At the tactical level, the three Focus Groups (environment, safety/occupational health, and energy) cultivate and recommend priority projects to the TAG and Project Selection Committee for funding. Transition Partners ensure that NDCEE's investments are carried forward in the next phases of the Research Development Test and Evaluation process, as identified in each funded project's Technology Transition Agreement.

NDCEE projects enable readiness for the Services under increasingly complex and demanding scenarios. The interdependency of national security with energy supply and costs, water supply and costs, environmental resiliency, and human health and safety are clear and NDCEE projects provide forward-looking solutions to these challenges. Failure to further fund and validate promising technologies that are at the mature or Commercial-off-the-Shelf stage, would result in lost modernization opportunities and validation before they go into a military environment. These initiatives need to be carried forward into an operational/realistic testing environment so that they can support mission readiness and training when ultimately fielded to the Services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Project implements the provisions of Title 10 United States (U.S.) Code, Section 2350a, Cooperative Research and Development (R&amp;D) Projects: Allied Countries. The objective is to improve, through the application of emerging technologies, the conventional defense capabilities of the U.S. and our cooperative partners, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), U.S. major non-NATO allies and Friendly Foreign countries through technology sharing and joint equipment development, thereby reducing U.S. acquisition costs. Cooperative efforts also improve multinational force compatibility with potential coalition partners through the development and use of similar equipment and improved interfaces. The Project focuses specifically on international cooperative technology demonstration, validation, and interoperability of Army weapon and command, control, communications and information (C3I) systems, including the NATO Defense Against Terrorism initiatives. Activities are implemented through international agreements with foreign partners that define scope, cost and work sharing arrangements, management, contracting, security, data protection and third party transfers. Funds are used to pay for only the U.S. work share that occurs in the United States at U.S. Government and U.S. contractor facilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisition Strategy: 
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing  per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the of the U.S. Army. 
All projects are test or technical demonstrations to feed into potential new requirements in support of Army Transformation to the Future Force or as product improvements to the Current Force.

List of the programs curently in place:
Communications, Interoperability, and Electronics Technologies
The goal of this project is to develop technologies that enable interoperability among partner countries' command, control, communications, sensors, and information systems.   Efforts under this project include development of a single solution standard avoiding development of multiple unique solutions and leverage existing interoperability standards developed by NATO. Such standards include common doctrine, technical and procedural specifications to make better use of existing information, shared data, leverage national operating picture capabilities and enable the development of interoperability of data, databases, applications, security domains and national networks architectures.  Includes projects formerly titled Multi-National Network Enabled Capabilities, Low Level Air Defense Interoperability, JTRS, Combat Identification, and Multilateral Interoperability Program.

Aviation Systems Technologies 
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly improved aerodynamics, aeromechanics, avionics, weapons and sensor integration, propulsion, and aviation autonomy technologies that improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for vertical lift aviation systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Ground Systems Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve survivability, weapons, ground platforms (manned and unmanned), and mobility and counter-mobility to provide soldiers with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities in weapons and military vehicles.   Areas of cooperation include ground systems design, propulsion, structures, robotics, alternative fuels and lubricants, systems integration, electronics, and power management.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Weapons and Munitions Technologies
The goal of this project is to cooperate with partner countries to increase interoperability and develop jointly technologies to improve range, payloads, speed, survivability and lethality to maintain U.S. technical superiority and combat overmatch for Army weapons systems and associated munitions.   Areas of cooperation include fuzing and warhead systems, guidance systems, counter improvised explosive device neutralization, directed energy, and fire control systems.  Such cooperative development will be done under the auspices of international agreements established among the participating countries for the purposes of improving defense capabilities of the U.S. and partner countries.

Armaments Cooperation Enterprise Support
The goal of this program is to expand worldwide allied standardization and interoperability through cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) and technology sharing per SECDEF guidance and especially in support of the U.S. Army. This program will fund the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate internationally, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This program will also include:  the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U. S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill); the Technical Cooperation Program, and Army armaments cooperation working groups with many nations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is an initiative to develop a family of vertical lift aircraft for the United States Armed Forces. FVL was established by the Secretary of Defense to focus all Department of Defense (DoD) vertical lift capabilities and technology development as well as retain long-term engineering capabilities. The Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach for the next generation vertical lift aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of vertical lift aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. In 2017, FVL was identified as one of the Army's eight Cross Functional Team Pilots, derived from the six Chief of Staff of the Army modernization priorities. The development and fielding of FVL will significantly improve vertical lift capabilities providing critical aviation support to the Joint warfighting community.  Increases in maneuverability, range, speed, payload, survivability, reliability, and reduced logistical footprint can only be achieved through the FVL approach of developing new aircraft designs.  FVL will integrate advancements in technologies and design configurations balanced with appropriate trades to ensure affordability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2018 funding request was reduced by $4M due to a delay in the FVL Project B47's Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) Analysis of Alternatives.

The FY 2019 funding request was increased for the Army's future vertical lift program to initiate the Capability Set One Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) competitive prototyping effort. In FY 2020 and beyond, FARA funds are requested under Project F12 Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft.  
          
The FY 2020 funding request increase ($10.300M) in PE 0603801A B47 for Future Long Range Attack Aircraft is the funding required to support the Army's opportunity to accelerate the FLRAA program schedule.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Future Vertical Lift Project's funding provides for the development of a Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) Capability Set Three (CS3) aircraft system within the FVL family of systems.  FVL FLRAA (CS3) aircraft will conduct Air Assault, Amphibious Assault, Urban Assault/Security, Attack, Maritime Interdiction, Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR), Tactical Resupply, Direct Action (DA), Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) operations in support of Army, including Army Special Operations Command, Marine Corps and Joint forces.  The FVL FLRAA (CS3) platform will significantly increase speed, range, mobility, and payload over current US Army H-60 and US Marine Corps H-1 aircraft and provide Combatant Commanders with tactical capabilities at greatly increased operational and strategic distances.  The FVL Capability Set 3 Materiel Development Decision was approved October 2016.  FY 2018 funding continued to support FVL AoA modeling, simulation and analysis to include risk, cost and affordability, sustainment and trades and initiation of the Test Evaluation and Master Plan (TEMP), Draft Capability Development Document (CDD), Acquisition Strategy, Life Cycle Cost Estimate, and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP).  FY 2019 funding will complete the AoA efforts, Acquisition Planning and Strategy Development and LCSP, conduct Initial Readiness Assessments, prepare Systems Engineering decomposition and translation of Draft CDD into Weapon System Specification, and initiate the balance of Milestone A documentation and Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Contract Requirements Package (CRP).  FY 2020 funding will support the completion and staffing of key Milestone A documentation to include the Acquisition Strategy, the Weapon System Specification, the Systems Engineering Plan, and the LCSP and will support the continued development of the TEMP and the CRP.  The Army is continuing to seek opportunities to accelerate the FLRAA program schedule.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was initiated in 3rd Quarter FY 2017 to assess the technical feasibility, operational feasibility, technical risk, and affordability of potential materiel solutions.  The AoA will be informed by previous studies, ongoing Advanced Technology Development S&amp;T projects, and input from government, industry and academia.  The results of the AoA and Initial Readiness Assessments will be available to support a projected Milestone A decision in 4th Quarter FY 2021 and a Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Request for Proposal (RFP) Release in 1st Quarter FY 2022.  After a successful Source Selection Evaluation Board, the Army will award competitive TMRR contracts to complete preliminary design and risk reduction testing.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Project's funding provides for the development of a Capability Set 1 aircraft system within the FVL family of systems. FVL Capability Set 1 aircraft will conduct attack/reconnaissance missions in support of the Army. The FVL Capability Set 1 platform will fill the gap in capability for light weight attack/reconnaissance while significantly increasing speed, range, survivability, and lethality over the previously used OH-58 and provide Combatant Commanders with greatly increased tactical, operational and strategic capabilities. The FVL Capability Set 1 Initial Capabilities Requirements Document was approved in July 2018 under the name Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) received a Congressional plus up ($75.4M) in FY 2019 within the Project B47 FVL line.  A streamlined acquisition approach is planned by executing a competitive prototyping effort thru FY 2023 leading to entry to a formal program of record, potentially at MS B, in 2024 for an EMD phase and production. Four to six vendor solutions will be evaluated starting in FY 2019 thru FY 2020 resulting in a downselect to two vendor solutions for final design, build, and test, which will provide the required data and information to downselect to one solution for the EMD phase.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports efforts and studies for advanced component development, including prototypes of equipment and sub-systems which provide critical capabilities for Unified Land Operations (ULO), by extending the Commander's available maneuver space into and throughout the littorals, inland waterways and near coastal regions.  Army watercraft equipment enables the conduct of riverine, Logistics-over-the-Shore (LOTS) and Joint Logistics-over-the-Shore (JLOTS), inter and intra-theater transport, movement and maneuver, mission command and sustainment, as identified in DODD 5100.01 (Functions of the Department of Defense and it's major components).  Army Watercraft exploit the inland waterways and littoral regions as waterborne maneuver and supply routes, conducting operations through littoral entry points (developed, undeveloped, and austere access points) and in non-permissive, and/or denied access scenarios.  The Army uses a spectrum of Army Watercraft systems, from heavy sustainment ocean going landing craft capable of intra-theater and ship to shore transport and undeveloped beach or harbor access, to oceangoing and harbor utility tug boats and barge derricks for transport and denied port/salvage operations, and modular causeway systems for (LOTS/JLOTS).  The funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, survivability, supportability, energy efficiency, environmental, regulatory compliance and reliability of existing systems.  Funded efforts will address critical gaps in these areas for the current fleet, while at the same time researching, developing and testing emergent technologies. To support future acquisitions and future fleet planning, funding efforts which will include conducting trade studies, Business Case Analyses to inform the requirement development process, and support Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The funding enables Army's compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 and 502(6) of the Clean Water Act and compliance with Environmental protection Agency (EPA) emission standards.

FY20 funding supports modernization of the Legacy fleet wide systems by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vessel electronics, Victory Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AME will replace the M9 Armored Combat Earthmover and will be primarily a mobility asset, enabling maneuver units during attacks and movements to contact.  The AME will provide hasty survivability and counter-mobility capabilities to the maneuver units until more survivability and counter-mobility assets can move forward to support the maneuver force?s defenses.  It will operate with primarily medium and heavy mechanized forces but will be capable of supporting all combat forces and the full range of military operations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post (CP). The technologies in this portfolio are specifically designed to target CP challenges to enable power resilience across the operational spectrum and to resolve issues with setup and tear-down times and with the CP mobility and footprint. Additionally, this project supports enablers of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) which is a priority technology for the Network and Soldier Lethality CFT's.

As the DoD's Lead Standardization Activity for Tactical Electric Power (TEP), Project Manager Expeditionary Energy &amp; Sustainment Systems (PM E2S2) matures and integrates technology that will improve the next generation of standard tactical power sources in support of all Services. It supports technical maturation of TEP systems that will extend Army operational mission reach and duration in support of the Army Operating Concept and Multi-Domain Battle. 

Funding supports modernization of the current Tactical Electric Power capability by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to hybrid capabilities, light-weight power solutions, vehicle/tactical microgrid interoperability.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment an operational energy concepts.  

FY20 funding will continue to support the Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP), Power Distribution Illumination System, Electrical (PDISE) and Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports development of critical cargo aerial delivery capabilities. These systems will fill identified theater distribution and services capability gaps, improve unit sustainability, and increase combat effectiveness. This Project supports Advanced Component Development and Prototyping of Critical Distribution Capabilities which provide improved safety and accuracy while increasing survivability of aircraft, personnel, and equipment. This Project develops critical enablers that support the Army in executing future movement and maneuver operations and distributed sustainment support by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment. This Project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment through aerial delivery initiatives and reduces sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Rapid Rigging and DeRigging Airdrop System (RRDAS) Phase I</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Effort to reduce rigging times while also providing the capability to rapidly de-rig loads on the drop zone. This will reduce the lead time to prepare Low Velocity Airdrop System (LVADS) loads while also increasing the survivability of receiving ground forces by ensuring the airdrop loads (to include weapon systems, prime movers, trailers, etc.) are quickly de-rigged and made operational. RRDAS is a three phase Research, Development, Testing and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) effort, Phase I will focus on loads up to 20,000 pounds and platform lengths up to 20 feet and will include prime movers such as HMMWV.</r2:Description>

The mission includes developing fuel quality analysis systems; achieving greater capabilities in the removal of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) and other contaminants from water sources; reducing the logistics footprint; alternative source water acquisition, reutilization and disposal systems to reduce the requirement for transport of water into the theater; water purification and waste water treatment and material systems to decrease the logistics footprint and employment time for the transfer of liquid logistics in joint operations area.  This vital equipment enables the Army to achieve its mission by providing the the means to be highly mobile and self-sustaining in very hostile joint operations areas.  Future Force operations demand that combat systems be rapidly deployable to the theater, rapidly emplaced upon arrival, and rapidly relocated to support a fast moving non-linear battlefield.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Early Entry Fluid Distribution System (E2FDS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Early Entry Fluid Distribution System (E2FDS) is a rapidly emplaced, high-throughput petroleum distribution conduit system.  The E2FDS consists of 5-mile systems that can be connected to each other to form a pipeline trace up to 50 miles long.  It can throughput 850,000 gallons of petroleum or 650,000 gallons of raw/non-potable water per day.  E2FDS is emplacement at a rate of 25 miles per day and retrieved at a rate of 10 miles per day.  The components are configured in stackable International Standards Organization (ISO) 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) for deployment and is Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck-Load Handling System (HEMTT-LHS), Palletized Load System (PLS) and PLS Trailer transportable.  It includes a Command and Control Module (C2M) that allows for central control of the pipeline trace from a single location.  The E2FDS complements the Inland Petroleum Distribution System (IPDS) by adding an early entry capability as well as a means for rapidly extending existing pipeline.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Reduces the resource, operational energy and logistics footprint of critical soldier support and sustainment systems while maintaining or improving operational effectiveness.  The goal is to significantly reduce fuel, water, and power requirements to sustain multi-domain operations in addition to reducing maintenance and spare parts requirements. Systems such as Command Posts, Expeditionary Operating Bases, and Combat Support Hospitals require a significant amount of logistics and sustainment support which cost valuable resources, require extra human effort (that means a risk in the form of Soldiers on the road), limit endurance, restrict agility, and increase vulnerability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Expeditionary Waste to Energy System reduces the operational energy and logistics footprint of the expeditionary base camp system with the goal of providing an integrated waste management and disposal process add-on capability that can safely process up to two tons of mixed solid organic waste in a single day on site with the energy associated with the management process being converted to usable energy in the form of fuel, heat and/or electric power. This capability will provide a safe and suitable means to dispose of waste in remote expeditionary base camps while reducing the fuel and power requirements to sustain operations in the field. This capability provides a substantial improvement over the current practice of burn pits and backhaul with associated vulnerabilities and safety issues.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for infectious diseases of military relevance. These efforts are in: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and studies to determine if insects infected with pathogenic organisms are capable of infecting service members/preventive medicine measures. These funds support human clinical effectiveness (capacity to produce a desired size of an effect under ideal or optimal conditions) trials of the drug/vaccine in larger groups that are designed to assess how well the drug/vaccine works and continue safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers. Funding supports both technical evaluations and human clinical testing to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical diagnostic kits and devices. This work, which is performed in military laboratories or civilian pharmaceutical firms, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and accelerated recovery time once diagnosed to enhance battlefield readiness. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members. Product development priorities are determined based upon four major factors: (1) the extent and threat of the disease within the Combatant Commands theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development and production). Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 849.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of militarily relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. It provides for the planning and conduct of human clinical trials in a group of healthy volunteers to assess for safety and tolerability of medical countermeasures, how the drug/vaccine is distributed through, metabolized in, and excreted from the body, and to investigate the appropriate dose. Development efforts are focused on militarily unique needs affecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. The cumulative cost of treating HIV-positive DoD personnel is estimated to be $16.6 billion for 3000 personnel over a 50-year lifetime. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations. Products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 812.

Research efforts are coordinated with the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Global Vaccine Candidate: Developed human safety study test plan for new HIV vaccine components. Initiated regulatory and scientific reviews of human safety study test plan. Prepared clinical safety study sites in Africa to execute the study of the global vaccine. Global vaccine has moved up in priority because it meets the manufacturing capability requirement and can meet the Capability Development Document threshold in one step as opposed to incrementally.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the demonstration and validation of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. This Project funds human clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of biologics (products derived from living organisms) and devices necessary to meet medical requirements. When available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for transition to engineering and manufacturing development. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical logistics footprint through smaller weight, volume, and equipment independence from supporting materials. All clinical trials are conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA regulations. Products from this project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project 832.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Drug Testing Program - Client Collection System (DTP-CSS) is comprised of several variations of a desktop application used to select service members for random drug testing, prepare labels for urine specimen bottles, and print corresponding chain-of-custody documents. This Project will standardize DTP-CSS across all services and migrate it to a Web-based system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project is funded to achieve the required operational capability and common capability across the MEDEVAC fleet. The MEDEVAC MEP program modernizes and retrofits MEDEVAC legacy helicopters to achieve the medical capability provided by a limited number of mission specific MEDEVAC helicopters, model HH-60M. The Medevac Mission Equipment on the Army MEDEVAC helicopters is critical to maintaining high US troop survival rates during current and future conflicts by evacuating wounded troops quickly while providing good care enroute.  To better meet operational needs, in 2009 the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA) approved the force design update increasing the number of air frames for MEDEVAC companies. In 2010, the Army Medical Department (US Army) accepted life-cycle management of the MEDEVAC MEP from PEO Aviation.  Ongoing research and design efforts are required to prepare and optimize the MEDEVAC fleet with mission equipment. All products from this Project will transition to PE 0604807A/Project VS8.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE), Advanced Component Development and Prototypes, manages the Soldier as a system to increase combat effectiveness, test and deliver tangible products that save Soldiers lives and improve combat capability.  The PE provides funding for evaluating, developing, and testing emerging technologies and critical Soldier support systems to reduce technology risk.

CF2
The Integrated Squad effort includes the completion of the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA) and Squad Performance Model (SPM) programs.  Both of these efforts are Program Executive Office-Soldier (PEO-S) led and will develop a full system architecture for the Soldier and the Squad.  This will be accomplished by developing Interface Control Documents (ICDs) in order to provide common established interfaces for internal and external stakeholders who will interface on or with the Soldier platform.  A critical part of this effort is development of the "Squad as an Integrated Platform" vision based on threat, operational environment and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to inform investment decisions out to FY2050.  The ASA will develop a metric-based approach that will include live, virtual and constructive evaluations and tools across the DoD, academia and industry which will be used for senior leaders to make deliberate decisions based on the analysis of Soldier/ Squad performance

ET8
Personnel Airdrop System, supports efforts to improve Low Altitude and High Altitude personnel parachutes and associated equipment to include canopy improvement based on integration of new technology with the goal of enhancing the insertion capability of the airborne Soldier and increasing the performance, safety, and durability of personnel airdrop equipment.

S53
This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe. It funds efforts to transition new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistant (FR), moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in jungle/tropical and arctic environments. New technologies are indentified to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments. Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.

S54
The Small Arms Improvement Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) program provides funds to mature, demonstrate, test and evaluate emerging technology from Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP), Project 627, Program Element 0603607A, (Budget Activity 3), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Department of Energy National Laboratories, Research Development &amp; Engineering Centers (RDECs) and other domestic and foreign sources for small arms weapon systems and technology. Small arm weapon systems include weapons ranging up to 40 millimeter in caliber. Current and future efforts focus on improvements designed to enhance lethality, target acquisition and tracking, fire control, usability, training effectiveness and reliability of weapons to include ammunition when developing and/or evaluating standard and non-standard weapons. Focus areas include the maturing of technology through testing and evaluation of sub-system or system prototypes which demonstrates light weight materials, wear resistant/protective/anti-reflective coatings, observation/situational awareness improvements, human-systems integration, robotic armament capability, non-lethal capability, and equipment enhancements.  Benefits include continuous improvements to small arms weapon systems, fire control equipment, optics, gun barrels, training devices, suppressors, component mounts, weapon mounts, and weapon/ammunition interface. Includes costs associated with efforts for integration and interface of products on Soldiers' head, body and weapons.

VS4
This Project supports efforts to evaluate integrated technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) technology transition from the laboratory to operational use.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Project CF2 is a new start beginning in FY 2020.  This program supports the Cross Functional Team (CFT).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Integrated Squad effort includes the completion of the Adaptive Squad Architecture (ASA) and Squad Performance Model (SPM) programs.  Both of these efforts are Program Executive Office-Soldier (PEO-S) led and will develop a full system architecture for the Soldier and the Squad.  This will be accomplished by developing Interface Control Documents (ICDs) in order to provide common established interfaces for internal and external stakeholders who will interface on or with the Soldier platform.  A critical part of this effort is development of the "Squad as an Integrated Platform" vision based on threat, operational environment and collaboration with internal and external stakeholders to inform investment decisions out to FY2050.  The ASA will develop a metric-based approach that will include live, virtual and constructive evaluations and tools across the DoD, academia and industry which will be used for senior leaders to make deliberate decisions based on the analysis of Soldier/ Squad performance.
      FY20 RDTE funding in the amount of $1.959M will finalize an initial ASA and SPM, consisting of 3 critical products: the Configuration Database (CD), the Architectural Assessment Tool (AAT) and the SPM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports efforts to evaluate and integrate technologies and representative or prototype systems that help expedite Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. Efforts focus on proving out commonality across as broad a spectrum of users as possible to provide a modular, integrated uniform/clothing system from skin out and head-to-toe. It funds efforts to transition new technologies and domestically available fabrics with Flame Resistant (FR), moisture wicking, insect protection and camouflage technologies, including integration of fabrics appropriate for uniforms and equipment used in jungle/tropical and arctic environments. New technologies are indentified to monitor health and improve Soldier survivability, reduce weight, and improve affordability, mobility and comfort in combat and training/administrative environments. Includes integration and interface on the Soldier system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020 funding within this Program Element will transition/realign as follows:
 - Project FD9 Robotics Systems: Robotic Combat Vehicle - Experimental Unit Prototypes (TARDEC) effort will remain in this PE but realign to Project CF4 Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) NGCV-CFT.
 - Project FD9 Robotics Systems: Leader Follower efforts will transition to PE 0604622A Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles Project EZ8, Leader Follower.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 

FY 2020 funding in the amount of $1.258 million will support program management activities to include salaries and travel, conduct Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) on Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP) programs, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), and payload technology maturation efforts.

The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier and reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just 3. Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.

Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits. RDTE funds enable support to capability development of Tactical Wheeled Vehicle - Leader Follower (TWV-LF), Automated Convoy Operations (ACO), Dismounted Engineer Mobility System (DEMS), modular mission payloads, Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type II. Funds prepare these capabilities for entrance into the Defense Acquisition System (i.e. Milestone decision). RDTE Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems funding supports Leader Follower and Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitions from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development and initial prototype testing. This will stress the autonomy systems and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations.

Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of providing vehicles that Soldiers will use to develop new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. Within RCV there are two major lines of effort executed in 3 phases: RCV Surrogate Experimental Unit Prototyping (Phase 1 &amp; 2) and RCV Purpose Built Experimental Unit Prototyping (Phase 3). These efforts provide the basis for the Army to make the decision to move forward with a  Robotic Combat Vehicle program transitioning from Technology Demonstrations to Program of Record through Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) development and initial prototype testing and iterative Soldier evaluations. This will stress the autonomy systems developed within the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) base and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations in addition to helping the Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team (NGCV CFT) refine their RCV requirements and develop the CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for Manned / Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) in combat relevant missions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This will stress the autonomy systems developed within the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) base and ultimately reduce Program of Record testing requirements, technical risks, and costs through studies and validated simulations in addition to helping the Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team (NGCV CFT) refine their RCV requirements and develop the CONOPS and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for Manned / Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) in combat relevant missions.

In order to accelerate user involvement with RCV platform capabilities, the RCV Surrogate Experimental Unit Prototyping effort will be executed through a two (2) phase activity.  The RCV surrogate platform build (Phase 1) was initiated in FY19 under 0604017A Robotics Development, Project FD9 Robotics Systems and will conclude in this project with test and demonstration. This project will finalize Phase 1's rapid prototype build of surrogate RCV platforms using existing robotized vehicles and conduct Soldier evaluations at the platoon level (4 RCVs) through MUMT evaluations. Lessons learned from the platoon experiment will inform development of the purpose built RCV platforms (Phase 3) as well as inform S&amp;T investment to help close gaps identified in unmanned vehicle performance. In order to conduct larger scale MUMT maneuvers and to continue to advance the autonomous performance of the robotic platforms, two additional platoons of surrogate RCVs will be built leveraging existing contractor unmanned platforms for a total of a company set (12) RCV.  The surrogate company of RCVs (Phase 2) will be used for a second round of Soldier experimentation building off of the platoon exercises and providing additional refinement of CONOPs/TTPs with a representative operational formation and will provide a test bed for the latest autonomous capabilities developed in S&amp;T.

The RCV Purpose Built Experimental Unit Prototyping line of effort (Phase 3) will develop and produce innovative, unmanned platforms that take advantage of being designed specifically for unmanned combat operations such as reduced platform size and improved mobility. The intent is to award a minimum of two contracts to design and build up to a company of twelve (12) RCV platforms for user evaluation and experimentation starting at the end of FY 2022. The  RCV platforms will incorporate mature technology capabilities transitioned from S&amp;T as they become available to include the latest autonomous mobility capability, improved user control interfaces and advanced sensing and aided target recognition.  The Purpose Built RCV platform requirements will be informed by the initial surrogate platoon experimentation (Phase 1) and Soldier feedback.  The surrogate company experimentation (Phase 2) will inform how the purpose built RCVs will be used in a representative formation as well as reducing risk on critical software enabled capabilities such as the latest autonomous behaviors, mission command of multiple RCVs in an effective MUMT formation and Soldier control stations for RCV.  Ultimately the purpose of this line of effort is to determine if RCV is ready to enter a rapid acquisition program of record or if the capability needs more development before it is operationally effective.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) ? Prototype Platforms effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of creating an experimental unit that Soldiers will use to create new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. Several variants of prototypes will be created, starting first with surrogate platforms which adapt existing platforms into surrogate RCVs for early experimentation in several different weight classes.  Based off of lessons learned from the surrogate vehicle builds, platforms optimized to be RCVs will be built which maximize the capability advantages that unmanned platforms can offer such as reduced platform size and weight. The platforms will be built with the purpose of going through ATEC safety release and ultimately for Soldier evaluation through iterative User experimentation.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Soldier Robotics Systems for Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing/transitioning technology. Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives/Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation/transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for robotic systems that are transported by vehicle and maneuver under their own power. 
Funding supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies.   Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts."

FY 2020 funding in the amount of $1.258 million will support program management activities to include salaries and travel, conduct Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) on Enhanced Robotic Payload (ERP) programs, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), Common Robotic System (Light Reconnaissance) Robot (LRR) (CRS(LR)), and payload technology maturation efforts.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Note: Project Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization complete in FY19.

The Battery Modernization &amp; Interface Standardization (BMIS) program was established to help bring greater power efficiency and effectiveness to the dismounted Soldier and to reduce the proliferation of proprietary batteries across the Army. BMIS will develop the Army Standard Family of Batteries (SFoB), a central acquisition management authority, and reduce 38 Communications-Electronics (C-E) battery types, currently in use, to just 3. Expand to include batteries for generators and hybrids, robotics, vehicles, and low density/usage systems.  Battery standardization and policy enforcement will support Operational Readiness at a reduced cost to the Army while maintaining configuration management, life cycle support, safety standards, and technological upgrades.

Funding supports modernization of the current battery types.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Robotics Systems for Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (ALUGS) Robotics Development (RD) improves robotic and autonomous program acquisition schedules by supporting the development of integrated and synchronized capability documents (e.g. JCIDS, Department Directed, etc.) and by maturing / transitioning technology.  Activities include studies, assessments, and document development such as Technology Readiness Levels, Manufacturing Readiness Levels, Analysis of Alternatives / Letter of Sufficiency determinations, draft acquisition documents, and draft contract documents. Efforts include robotics and autonomous systems technology maturation / transition from Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) projects and Robotic Enhancement Program (REP) initiatives, Milestone Decision Documentation (MDD), and activities leading up to formal program initiation at Milestone B or C. The pre-acquisition activities conducted under this line intend to reduce acquisition cost, schedule, and performance risk by conducting market surveys, technical risk assessments, developing performance specifications, scopes of work, acquisition strategies, systems engineering plans, test and evaluation master plans, lifecycle sustainment plans, engaging in early test planning, and prototype development activities. This line is for large robotic systems that are transported by vehicle, maneuver under their own power, or are installed as robotic applique kits.

Funding will expand Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) including CASTLE capability to test and evaluate Manned Unmanned teaming, combat scenarios or other emerging Robotics program needs.  RD funding will utilize the M&amp;S environment to mature and evaluate S&amp;T for inclusion to program requirements, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and/or technical insertions, utilize gaming technology in conjunction with Autonomy Software to develop Training, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs), requirements and CONOPS.

Funding also supports modernization of the current Ground Robotic fleets by investigating technology insertions including, but not limited to: condition based maintenance, vetronics, Robotic Architecture, autonomous operations and other emerging technologies. Funding will also support developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping effort will produce unmanned combat vehicle prototypes with the purpose of creating an experimental unit that Soldiers will use to create new Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), and new requirements for unmanned combat vehicles to support Army Modernization priorities. Effort will leverage a three phase approach to promote multiple industry partners to provide innovative, armed unmanned platforms for soldier experimentation with the intent of defining requirements for future RCV program of record.  The first two phases will focus on surrogate RCV platforms to get armed unmanned systems into Soldier?s hands for experimentation as quickly as possible. Phase 1 delivers a platoon set of modified M113s with remote weapons stations in order to start to define how an RCV can augment combat capability and to help refine requirements based on user feedback for a follow-on purpose built RCV effort which will start in Phase 3.  Phase 2 adds an additional two platoons of surrogate RCVs to enable soldiers to execute company level maneuvers to better understand how RCVs will be used in the future fight and to refine software behaviors and control strategies of the RCVs.. Lessons learned from the phase 1 soldier experimentation will directly shape the requirements for the Phase 3 purpose built RCV effort which will competitively deliver up to a company set of RCVs through at least 2 industry partners for an extended Soldier evaluation.  CONOPs and TTPS developed under Phase 2 will inform extended operations experiment in phase 3 and ultimately form the basis for a decision point to move forward with a procurement of RCVs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Robotics Development (RD) is designed to facilitate the transition of robotics and autonomous systems technology from Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects into emerging programs of record.  It informs the acquisition process early in the development cycle allowing key stakeholders the ability to make integration decisions and affordability trades while writing requirements.

Product Manager Applique and Large Unmanned Ground Systems (PdM ALUGS) builds upon the TARDEC Expedient Leader Follower (ELF) Operational Technology Demonstration (OTD) to provide a limited autonomous vehicle capability to Tactical Wheeled Vehicles including the Palletized Load System (PLS) A1. Efforts include Capabilities Document input, close monitoring of OTD activities that feed cost estimates, capture technical and test data, provide test support, develop Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities, and develop a Software Integration Lab (SIL). Efforts may support Rapid prototyping to inform emerging programs. A "buy/lease, try and inform" methodology may be used to evaluate Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS), Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) robotics products that have the potential to enhance Soldier combat effectiveness. Actual operational user feedback and evaluation results obtained will inform emerging capabilities and requirements documents in support of a return on investment to support future Army decision making.
  
Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) funding supports Systems Engineering, Requirements, Cost Analysis, Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) support, and technology transition plans.  

Tank Automotive Armaments Research Development &amp; Engineering Center (TARDEC) funding allows the Army to demonstrate and operationally assess an unmanned vehicle capability with operational units and users to validate the technology.  The Army will build, and test prototype systems for safety release, Soldier use, and further technology maturation.  

Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) Experimental Unit Prototyping will provide unmanned combat vehicles to enable users to assess the capability of the platforms and created new CONOPS and doctrine for manned/unmanned teaming based operations.  Efforts will inform new CONOPS, identified system limitations and benefits and provide an achievable, analytically backed basis for future RCV requirements documents to drive future acquisition programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program was a FY 2019 new start.  FY 2020 and out funding supporting CFT Network efforts has been realigned to 0604541A Unified Network Transport.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and technical demonstrations of selected technologies conducted by Cross-Functional Teams (CFT) in order to inform and refine the development of initial capability documents in support of Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), Future Vertical Lift (FVL), Network Command, Control Communication, and Intelligence (NC3I), Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (APNT), Air and Missile Defense (AMD), Soldier Lethality, and Synthetic Training Environment (STE). Funding facilitates the experimentation and demonstration of priority technologies to ensure that planned capabilities are technologically feasible, affordable, and available to Soldiers. Benefits include the narrowing of capability gaps by developing capability documents and rapidly transitioning leader-approved capability requirements to the Army Acquisition System. In project CF1, CFT will conduct pre-Materiel Solution Analysis Phase experimentation and technical demonstrations to enable capability document development and improve the decision making for potential programs of record.

This investment supports the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) six modernization priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These efforts will be used, but are not limited to identify, develop, prototype, evaluate, analyze, and demonstrate potential enhanced capabilities and extended range alternative solutions. These efforts will quantify the respective maturity and effectiveness to mitigate capability gaps against changing near peer representative enemy target sets and operational scenarios. Enhanced capability, extended range and other technologies to provide overmatch capabilities will be evaluated for merit and will provide increased performance for production of TLS systems in FY2022.The TLS program will leverage all authorities to accelerate delivery.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funding for analytical support of Analysis of Alternatives.  Analyses of Alternatives are statutory requirements for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and regulatory for all other programs. Based on Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Analyses of Alternatives are required to be completed for a new start program prior to its first Milestone Decision.  The Program Element (PE) provides analytical capability for Pre-Milestone A programs that emerge outside the normal budget or POM cycles.  Normally these programs are without program managers and require analysis to support Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's requirement and acquisition needs and priorities.  The Analyses of Alternatives support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds values and tradeoff analysis.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plans.  Work in this Program Element (PE) is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.  The Army is projecting to start work on multiple Analyses of Alternatives beginning in FY 2020, and will assess and fund the highest Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's priorities during the year of execution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Normally these programs are without program managers and require analysis to support Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's requirement and acquisition needs and priorities.  The Analyses of Alternatives support the preparation of the Capability Development Document, Key Performance Parameters and Thresholds values and tradeoff analysis.  The cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy and Plans.  Work in this Program Element is performed by analytical agencies such as U.S. Army TRADOC Analysis Center and U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity.  The Army is projecting to start work on multiple Analyses of Alternatives beginning in FY 2020 and will assess and fund the highest Congressional, Defense and Army Senior Leader's priorities during the year of execution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2019 funding supports Analysis of Alternatives for new start programs that do not yet have a Program Manager assigned and to augment PM funds where requirement decisions drive changes in scope or increased fidelity to achieve Congressional intent and interest.  Analysis of Alternatives initiation, scope, and fidelity are determined through the AROC process prior to the materiel development decision. Current projections indicate multiple new start programs will need to start their Analysis of Alternatives in FY 2019, including Unified Network Operations, Common Operating Environment, Cyberspace Situational Understanding, Offensive Cyberspace Operations, Mobile Armored Combat Earthmover, and Synthetic Training Environment.  In addition, several Analyses of Alternatives started in FY 2018 will continue to require analysis funding into FY 2019, to include Vehicle Protection Suite, Terrestrial Layer Intelligence Support for Multi-Domain Battle/Joint Combined Army Maneuver, Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System, and Advanced Threat Detection System.  In the Spring of 2018 (on or about 1 May) we will provide the Committee an updated listing of projected FY 2019 new start program Analyses of Alternatives.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) is a critical system in the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO)battle concept that will employ MDO capabilities at all echelons and allow ground based forces to project power from land into other domains to defeat highly capable enemies, secure terrain, and consolidate gains. FUAS encompasses an array of capabilities from platoon soldiers to Division Commanders. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the FUAS Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) on 12 OCT 2018. The ICD includes requirements for Scalable Control Interface (SCI), Air Launched Effects (ALE), and Purpose-Driven UAS (to include Future Tactical UAS and Advanced UAS).

The Future Unmanned Aircraft System (FUAS) will be comprised of multiple components including the Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS) for the Brigade Combat Team (BCT), the Advanced UAS (AUAS) for the Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB), and Air Launched Effects (ALE). The FTUAS seeks to replace the RQ-7 assets within the Brigade Combat Teams. Key attributes of the FTUAS focus on Rapid Deployability, Expeditionary Maneuver, and Mobility for adaptive and agile operations. FTUAS will consist of an aircraft subsystem that will include the airframe, propulsion, avionics, communications, navigation, and software systems; aircraft-specific ground support equipment including power generation, transportation, or command and control equipment; aircraft software; and required engineering, logistics, and programmatic support. FUAS will penetrate defense-in-depth environments by employing Air Launched Effects (ALE) with teaming and swarming effects to detect, decoy, jam RADAR and communications, conduct cyber-attack, spoof and jam GPS, and kinetic engagement.


Justification: FY 2020 FTUAS RDTE Base funding of $40.745 million (M) will be utilized for the following: 1) $18.079M to support the USARPAC Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) Demonstration, 2) $20.000M to support ALE Early Systems Analysis, 3) $2.666M provides Systems Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) to support of FTUAS and ALE development and preparation of pre-milestone decision documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TRADOC Capabilities Manager (TCM) - Future Vertical Lift (FVL) has prepared an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) that is in JROC staffing. PM TUAS will follow that approval with an MDD in FY 2021 and a subsequent Analysis of Alternatives phase.

The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) Cross Functional Team (CFT) is overseeing a demonstration effort in FY 2019 and FY 2020 that will inform the Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) requirement to develop capability that will ultimately replace the RQ-7B (Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System) within the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) formation. Demonstration effort will focus on conducting analysis and obtaining field data that will be used to write the Capabilities Development Document that will serve as the formal requirement to replace the RQ-7B within the BCTs. As part of the program development, a Materiel Development Decision will be conducted in FY2021 followed by an Analysis of Alternatives and ultimately a decision that will identify the appropriate entry into the Milestone Decision process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Lower Tier Air Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program will provide the required sensing capabilities, surveillance and fire control in the lower tier portion of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) of the ballistic missile defense battlespace. The acquisition program will competitively select the sensor/radar set (RS) to replace the baseline PATRIOT RS (AN/MPQ-65A) due to threat changes and the growing obsolescence and high Operational &amp; Support (O&amp;S) cost of the existing RS. The LTAMDS capability will address critical capability gaps, modernize technology, reduce O&amp;S costs, mitigate obsolescence, and increase reliability and maintainability. The LTAMDS capability will increase sensor/radar performance to maximize the inherent PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhanced (MSE) Interceptor capabilities to engage threats.

FY 2020 base dollars in the amount of $427.772 million supports acceleration of the Lower Tier Air Missile Defense (LTAMDS) Sensor program.  FY 2020 tasks include purchase of prototypes, purchase of test equipment, and supports programmatic and engineering activities needed to select the best technical approach that meets accelerated fielding timelines and facilitates incremental capability enhancements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

CFT Supported, LTAMDS.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) satisfies the Warfighter's capability requirements in the Integrated Air and Missile Defense domain. The program provides the required sensing capabilities in the lower tier portion of the air and missile defense battlespace and expands the battlespace for the PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor. The Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved LTAMDS requirements in April 2016.

The Army will competitively select the LTAMDS to service Air and Missile Defense threats using state of the art technology, reduce Operating and Sustainment, mitigate obsolescence, and increase reliability and maintainability.

LTAMDS FY 2020 funding will be utilized for procurement of prototypes, integration of LTAMDS technology into prototypes, further development of system performance specifications, and to initiate contractor verification testing. FY 2020 activities support the FY 2018 NDAA requirement to accelerate LTAMDS Initial Operational Capability to not later than December 2023.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To enhance the Warfighter's lethality, survivability, and combat effectiveness, the Army is using full and open competitive processes within Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements for rapid prototyping, qualification, and initial fielding efforts to meet the intent of FY 2018 NDAA Congressional language. Middle Tier Acquisition approach (Section 804, FY 2016 NDAA) authorities will be leveraged in conjunction with the OTA to facilitate and accelerate the LTAMDS program. OTA promotes non-traditional defense contractor involvement, cost sharing arrangements, and accelerates schedules.  A FEDBIZOPS announcement and subsequent LTAMDS Industry Day generated government-contractor dialogue, provided contractor cost and schedule estimates, verified industry technology and manufacturing readiness, and informed stakeholders on design approaches and potential materiel solutions. This approach also provides senior leader decision points along the way to make informed decisions based on industry ability to meet threshold requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds experimental prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to support advanced ground systems, aviation systems, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of advanced technologies and systems in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios as well as the maturation and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Benefits include maturing technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, informing emerging requirements for future programs of record, and reducing technology risk in order to transition of leap-ahead capabilities into acquisition programs. Technology Maturation Initiative efforts mature and integrate advanced component technologies into system and sub-system technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes, which are then validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation efforts and programs of record. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This PE provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishes a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts and acquisition programs.  

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this PE is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC), the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the development and demonstration of a robust Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) for rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping of major Army platforms. Computation Prototyping Environment (CPE) provides the ability to validate platform design variations in a VPG, in a way that identifies potential performance and design failures, and assesses mitigating solutions and trades prior to cost-bearing production and manufacturing. Activities under this Project include the maturation and integration of physics-based, computational modeling with new advances in deep learning in order to provide the ability to virtually explore design tradespaces and understand possible defeat strategies. This Project leverages recent Department of Defense (DOD) advancements in large data tradespace analytics, high-fidelity physics-based modeling, deep learning techniques, high-performance computing capabilities, and inverse modeling approaches to enable rapid computational prototyping to inform emerging acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures, integrates, and demonstrates protection and survivability technologies as part of active protection systems (APS) prototyping for the Army's combat fleet of vehicles. Activities integrate complimentary survivability technologies to enable layers of enhanced protection capability, providing greater survivability against current and emerging advanced threats. This Project demonstrates a suite of technologies on a fielded combat vehicle platform using an APS common architecture, and defines component interface standards and specifications that will enable adaptive APS solutions. Activities support the Army's APS strategy to maintain or reduce vehicle weight by reducing reliance on armor with other means such as sensing, warning, hostile fire detection, and active countermeasures.  

Work in this Project is coordinated with PE 0603462A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Advanced Technology) and transitions to PE 0604852A (Suite of Vehicle Protection Systems - EMD). 

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Will validate the integrated APS system function on the demonstrator, and test and evaluate the platform vehicle to ensure the added suite of technologies does not introduce unintended degraded performance to the vehicle?s mission. Upon completion of testing, results will inform vehicle Product Manager?s acquisition planning for the APS protection suite. Will continue the vehicle protection layering approach and select additional (mature) APS component technologies for integration, offering incremental improvement options for protection and survivability for the vehicle platform. Will design and begin integration of additional layered protection technologies.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, this effort was funded in Program Element (PE) 0604115A (Technology Maturation Initiatives) / Project DS3 (Technology Maturation Initiatives).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and demonstrates an integrated a 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system into a Stryker platform, providing a system-level, High Energy Laser (HEL) experimental prototype for demonstration in realistic operating environments. These demonstrations will inform requirements, decrease risk for future Army HEL acquisition programs, and support the future development of warfighter Tactics/Techniques/Procedures and Concept of Operations. HEL weapon systems are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to stockpile ordnance. A 50 kW-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); sensors; and optics for maneuvering Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Demonstrations will also inform potential future capability to defeat both fixed- and rotary-wing manned aircraft. Leveraging Government investments and Industry technology advancements, will review and select existing HEL subsystem designs for integration into a Stryker combat vehicle; will conduct integration and demonstration of a system-level HEL experimental prototype; and will provide assessment of technical performance in an operational environment.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT).

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and to support Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and integrates next-generation 50mm weapon system technologies transitioned from under the Advanced Lethality and Accuracy System for Medium Caliber (ALAS-MC) advanced technology development effort into a vehicle-agnostic combat turret to inform requirements for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV). This Project integrates and assesses critical ALAS-MC 50mm technology components for on-the-move engagement of moving personnel and materiel targets, bringing the subsystem to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Under Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System (ATLAS), this Project matures and integrates advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to enable aided target detection/recognition capability for NGCV using next generation, multi-spectral electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) targeting sensors. AI/ML algorithms are integrated with real-time intelligent fire control and mission planning interfaces to demonstrate automated turret capabilities, and provide overmatch via reduced target acquisition and engagement timelines.

Work in this Project is related to and fully integrated with the efforts funded in PE 0603462A, Project BF5, Advanced Lethality and Accuracy System for Med Cal; and PE 0603462A, Project BG1, Sensors for Autonomous Operations and Survivability Advanced Technology.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project will mature and demonstrate Manned Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) technologies in a realistic operating environment to drive down risk in three critical areas for ground MUMT: remote lethality, unmanned maneuver and network. These major technical hurdles will be addressed by integrating mature technologies into the MUMT Campaign of Learning through three, synergistic integration efforts: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/ground platform integration, a transportable MUMT simulation environment and an advanced interface for the Warfighter.  

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. Work in this Project is performed by the U.S. Army Futures Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project matures and integrates long-range armament technologies for both weapons and munitions to demonstrate potential deep strike objective capabilities from future cannon artillery systems. It will demonstrate revolutionary performance to support Long Range Fires by further developing, integrating, and demonstrating enhanced lethality and range extension solutions for cannon system performance with maximum effects.  Strategic Long Range Cannon activities include integrating component technologies into sub-system and system-level experimental prototypes for novel cannon, munition, and fire control, including guidance and propulsion. Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) activities mature, integrate, and demonstrate a novel sub-system for ammunition handling and a long-range artillery projectile to support prototyping and experimentation of a next-generation, extended range armaments system that will provide significantly increased range and accuracy without an increase in platform weight. This Project also demonstrates and experiments with emerging and commercially-available technology components to demonstrate improved Stinger capabilities when used in a Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) configuration.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the maturation, integration, and demonstration of advanced technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes to support advanced ground systems; aviation systems; command, control, communication &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment; precision weapons, High Energy Laser (HEL) systems; and Soldier equipment. Technology Maturation Initiative (TMI) efforts mature and integrate component technologies into early system and sub-system experimental prototypes for demonstration in relevant environments and tactical/operational scenarios, taking technologies to a goal of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Technology demonstrators and experimental prototypes are validated and transitioned to priority Army experimentation and acquisition efforts to inform requirements for future programs of record and reduce the risk of technology insertion. These efforts are typically 2-4 years in duration, and are approved by Army senior leadership based on priority and opportunity, to ensure that demonstrations have high potential for filling capability gaps and transitioning. Activities include the maturation, integration, and demonstration of HEL prototype weapons performance on a combat platform in realistic operational environments in support of the Army's objective capability for Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD). A 50 kilowatt (kW)-class laser weapon system has the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial systems(UASs), sensors, and optics for maneuvering brigade combat teams (BCTs). Activities also include sub-system prototyping and integration of leap-ahead ground combat vehicle powertrain technologies; and integration and demonstration of key Active Protection System (APS) components to provide modular and layered vehicle protection effects (hard-kill and soft-kill), enabling power projection and enhanced survivability. Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) efforts include demonstration of physics-based, computational modeling integrated with new advances in deep learning to explore design tradespaces and understand defeat strategies for prototype platforms. This Project provides the Army with an improved mechanism for enabling greater competition in the latter stages of technology maturation and establishing a closer alignment between Science and Technology (S&amp;T) efforts and acquisition programs.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  Work in this Project is performed by the Army Futures Command (AFC); the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT); and the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC).

Funding has been realigned to reflect the FY 2020 financial restructure and Army Modernization Priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Computational Prototyping Environment (CPE) effort creates an integrated, robust, and verified system that leverages recent Department of Defense advancements in large data tradespace analytics, high-fidelity physics-based modeling, deep learning techniques, high performance computing capabilities, and inverse modeling approaches. The CPE demonstrates the early developmental verification and validation of selected weapons platform variations in a way that accurately identifies potential performance and design failures, while also testing and mitigating solutions and multiple trades in a Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) prior to cost-bearing production and manufacturing. CPE efforts facilitate rapid, accurate, and computational prototyping in a robust VPG for early performance verification of new capabilities.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>M-SHORAD is an Air Defense weapon system consisting of multiple ground-to-air missile launchers, sensors and a gun on a Stryker A1 combat vehicle. M-SHORAD provides the Army improved capabilities for defense of maneuver formations and other tactical echelons from low altitude air attack and surveillance. Adaptive threats have developed a suite of airborne threat capabilities, supported by an integrated mix of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface shooters that threaten the ability of maneuver forces to conduct operations. Specifically, maneuver formations require the improved M-SHORAD air defense identification and defeat capabilities to counter Fixed Wing (FW), Rotary Wing (RW), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.  

The M-SHORAD capability will be provided through a multi-phase approach with a rapidly fielded Initial M-SHORAD system (supported by an Army Approved Directed Requirement) and an enduring M-SHORAD (supported by a Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved Capability Development Document (CDD) or Capability Production Document (CPD)) that will field the full capability. First, the Army will field the Initial M-SHORAD solution based on a FY 2018 Directed Requirement, which was informed by the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration. This system will provide the capability to identify, track, and neutralize or destroy low-altitude air threats to include FW, RW, and Group 3 UAS while keeping pace and surviving with the maneuver Brigades. The Initial M-SHORAD will be fielded to four M-SHORAD battalions. In addition, M-SHORAD will transition the Multi-Mission High Energy Laser (MMHEL) from Science and Technology into the M-SHORAD Program of Record. With the increased capability provided by the MMHEL technology, M-SHORAD will provide the long term capability to counter a broader range of FW, RW, UAS, and indirect fires (RAM) threats.

FY 2020 dollars in the amount of $39.100 million ($33.100 million base and $6.000 million OCO) will complete the Initial M-SHORAD capability development and integration into existing maneuver formation equipment. Efforts will include: completion of testing to achieve Urgent Materiel Release and Safety Certification; continuation of the development; and finalization of the required program documentation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>M-SHORAD procurement is funded through C14301. This includes Initial M-SHORAD procurement (FY 2020 through FY 2022).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition approach begins with the Initial M-SHORAD. The Initial M-SHORAD uses the FY 2017 M-SHORAD Demonstration as the initial basis to identify near-term initial solutions. The Program Office uses Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transactional Authority (OTA) agreements for the development and purchase of five Initial M-SHORAD prototypes according to the content of the Directed Requirement. The OTA efforts include: Mission Equipment Package (MEP); Platform Integrator effort to procure the Stryker vehicle and integrate the MEP; and the Stinger Launcher.

In addition, the Program Office will use FY 2021-2024 funds for an M-SHORAD with the MMHEL capability. The Program Office plans to award a single competitive OTA agreement. In FY 2021-2024, the Program will conduct development activities, component qualification, Operational Performance Assessment and Logistics and Safety Certifications. An Urgent Materiel Release and First Unit Equipped are planned for FY 2024.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) will provide the Army's ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied.  Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 Apr 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on 30 Jul 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on 28 Jul 2014.  The Assured PNT Cross Functional Team is drafting individual Capability Development Documents for each product.

PNT is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats, and field conditions (e.g. urban, dense vegetation), which means Warfighter assured access and integrity to PNT is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

Assured PNT consists of one project (ED5) Assured PNT and four separate and interdependent PNT products; (EH8) Dismounted A-PNT System, (EH9) Pseudolite, (EJ2) Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS), and (EJ3) Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS).  These interdependent PNT products assure access to and integrity of PNT information.  Each product provides a degree of standalone capability that can be leveraged across the solutions and enterprise enablers to raise the capabilities in all environments and across all formations and warfighting functions.  Project Manager (PM) PNT manages these four products (Dismounted A-PNT System, Pseudolite, Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS), and AJAS) constructed to develop, test, field, and sustain the A-PNT materiel solution.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) provides resiliency and software assurance processes that mitigate risks in a Global Positioning System (GPS)-challenged environment until future Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) solutions are fully implemented.  RSAM will result in software security updates for Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)-based GPS receivers including the dismounted/mounted Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and the embedded Ground Based-GPS Receiver Applications Module (GB-GRAM)/MicroGRAM,  RSAM will coordinate integrated software testing with host platforms and support client systems in synchronizing RSAM deployment to combat forces.

The Assured PNT Enterprise Enabler requirements will be refined by conducting technical demonstrations including Alternative Navigation (ALT NAV) and net-enabled GPS solutions that leverage commercial capabilities, existing contracts, industry, academia, and the warfighter in an iterative process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

The Dismounted Assured PNT (A-PNT) System acquires, protects, and distributes secure PNT to the Dismounted Soldier. Dismounted A-PNT System will be used in conjunction with the PEO Soldier Nett Warrior System. Dismounted A-PNT System is planned to be modular, scalable form-factor that paces the threats and includes development and integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensors. Dismounted A-PNT System includes receiver software capable of acquiring Pseudolite signals resulting in additional integrity for military GPS in denied environments and includes a Military-Code (M-Code) receiver solution with other future technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Dismounted A-PNT program is to provide the Soldier conducting operations outside of vehicles unhindered access to trusted PNT under conditions where space based PNT may be limited or denied as well as a means to maintain accurate position, velocity, and time information in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or degraded/denied environments.  The Dismounted A-PNT capability will provide improved performance and reliability, availability, and maintainability over the currently fielded Defense Advanced GPS Receiver.

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps.  Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units to support the capability development document requirements. This will be implemented by utilizing a competitive Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) contract vehicle to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct laboratory and performance testing.  The findings from these test efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to test-fix-test events. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

Highly accurate Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army forces to execute their mission. The Army requires ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field conditions.

Pseudolite (satellite-like transmitters) assure GPS access and integrity by providing PNT via terrestrial and airborne-based radio navigation GPS transmitters in electronically or physically challenged environments using a higher power signal. Area protection is provided through the deployment of Pseudolite transmitters supporting a Brigade Combat Team area of operations. Pseudolite supports continued operations of PNT-enabled systems such as Blue Force Tracker, Communications Networks and Precision Guided Munitions. Pseudolite consists of three segments:
1. Pseudolite Transmitter segment provides terrestrial and airborne radio navigation (GPS-like) service in electronically or physically challenged environments using a high power signal.
2. Command and Control (C2) segment to control the Pseudolite transmitters on the battlefield.
3. Receiver segment, which will develop software upgrades to current and future military GPS receivers to receive and process the Pseudolite signals.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Pseudolite Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) acquisition strategy was approved by the Milestone Decision Authority and Milestone A was successfully completed in May 2015. The Pseudolite product is finalizing the TMRR Phase of the acquisition life-cycle.

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units to support the capability development document requirements. This will be implemented by utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) competitive contract vehicle to obtain prototypes. The Government will conduct laboratory and performance testing. The findings from these test efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to test-fix-test events. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS) provides positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) data and is a key enabler and a cross cutting capability for Army ground maneuver forces to execute their mission in support of the Network Enabling Function. Army ground maneuver Forces require access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT may be limited or denied to maintain its Global Positioning System (GPS) military advantage on the battlefield. The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

The MAPS is a scalable, upgradable system mounted on Army ground force platforms.  It fuses GPS with complimentary navigation and timing technologies to provide trusted PNT to client systems and platforms. The MAPS distributes PNT data to multiple systems directly and via the network, reducing the dependency on multiple GPS receiver devices on a single platform. In order to achieve performance requirements in the highest threat level conditions, an Anti-Jam Antenna will be integrated with the MAPS. These two products each provide a degree of A-PNT protection.  Integrated together, however, these two products will close the capability gap and achieve the desired performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Mounted A-PNT program is to deliver distributed A-PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner.  The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps.  Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units to support the stand-alone requirements of Requirements Definition Package (RDP) 1.  This will be implemented by utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) competitive contract vehicle to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL) and anechoic chamber testing.  The findings from these test efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to test fix test events and begin platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Network Enabling Functions (Assured PNT).

The Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) provides point protection by steering electronic nulls at interference sources or beams at valid signal sources. This enables continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) signal acquisition and tracking in a navigation warfare (jamming) environment. The AJAS is deployed as a scalable component accessory to the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS).

The MAPS is a scalable, upgradable system mounted on Army ground force platforms. It fuses GPS with complimentary navigation and timing technologies to provide trusted PNT to client systems and platforms. The MAPS distributes Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data to multiple systems directly and via the network, reducing the dependency on multiple GPS receiver devices on a single platform. In order to achieve performance requirements in the highest threat level conditions, an Anti-Jam Antenna will be integrated with the MAPS. These two products each provide a degree of Assured-Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) protection. Integrated together, however, these two products will close the capability gap and achieve the desired performance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) program is to deliver distributed A-PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner.  The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps.  Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units to support the stand-alone requirements of Requirements Definition Package (RDP) 1.  This will be implemented by utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) competitive contract vehicle to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct partial Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL) and anechoic chamber testing.  The findings from these test efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to test-fix-test events and begin platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations. STE will be a common synthetic environment enabled by a core of Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT); common authoritative data and models; Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (Home Station, Armories, Institutions, Shipboard, Deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs) and a Soldier/Squad Virtual Training (S/SVT) close combat training capability. The first increment of the SSVT is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability and the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 which comprises the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.

FY 2020 base funding of $136.761 million will continue to develop and demonstrate prototype designs to reduce technical risk, validate designs, validate cost estimates, evaluate processes, and refine requirements for STE, support development and integration of the first increment of the S/SVT, which is an embedded STE training capability that includes OWT, TSS, TMT, into the operational capability of the IVAS. Based on these refined requirements and demonstrated prototype designs, integrated systems design of the end-item system can be initiated. Additionally, these efforts ensure the level of expertise required to operate and maintain the capability is consistent with the force structure. Increments 2 and 3 of SSVT provides the NEXTGEN Marksmanship and the NEXTGEN Call For Fire Artillery Virtual Training capability into the STE baseline. The SSVT system also combines individual Soldier and squad training capabilities (STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF)), into a single capability.

Funds were realigned from PE 0604715A in FY 2019 and 2020 for the first increment of the SSVT which is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability and the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 which comprises the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations. STE will be a common synthetic environment enabled by a core of Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT); common authoritative data and models; Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (Home Station, Armories, Institutions, Shipboard, Deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs) and a Soldier/Squad Virtual Training (S/SVT) close combat training capability, and a live training capability. The first increment of the SSVT is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability and the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 which comprises the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.

FY 2020 base funding of $41.676 million will continue to develop and demonstrate prototype designs to reduce technical risk, validate designs, validate cost estimates, evaluate processes, and refine requirements for STE, support development and integration of the first increment of the S/SVT, which is an embedded STE training capability that includes OWT, TSS, TMT, into the operational capability of the IVAS. Based on these refined requirements and demonstrated prototype designs, integrated systems design of the end-item system can be initiated. Additionally, these efforts ensure the level of expertise required to operate and maintain the capability is consistent with the force structure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Synthetic Training Environment (STE) is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations. STE will be a common synthetic environment enabled by a core of Global Terrain/One World Terrain (OWT); common authoritative data and models; Training Simulation Software (TSS), and Training Management Tools (TMT). The STE will be available where training occurs (Home Station, Armories, Institutions, Shipboard, Deployed) and will include Air and Ground Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainers (RVCTs) and a Soldier/Squad Virtual Training (S/SVT) close combat training capability, and a live training capability. The first increment of the SSVT is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability and the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 which comprises the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). The STE will be cloud-enabled, compatible with the Army Enterprise Network, and service-based through the Common Operating Environment, including Live and Constructive. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.

FY 2020 base funding of $95.085 million will continue to develop and demonstrate prototype designs to reduce technical risk, validate designs, validate cost estimates, evaluate processes, refine requirements, and support development and integration of the first increment of the S/SVT, which is an embedded STE training capability that includes OWT, TSS, TMT, into the operational capability of the IVAS. Based on these refined requirements and demonstrated prototype designs, integrated systems design of the end-item system can be initiated. Additionally, these efforts ensure the level of expertise required to operate and maintain the capability is consistent with the force structure.

The first increment of the SSVT which is the Squad immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) capability and the Heads Up Display (HUD) 3.0 which comprises the integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Increments 2 and 3 of SSVT provides the NEXTGEN Marksmanship and the NEXTGEN Call For Fire Artillery Virtual Training capability into the STE baseline. The SSVT system also combines individual Soldier and squad training capabilities (STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon    Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF)), into a single capability.

S/SVT is not a New Start for FY2020.  The program was previously funded under PE 0604715A.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Project HX1: Funds USASMDC/ARSTRAT to prototype a Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) System is to provide the Army with a prototype strategic attack weapon system to defeat Anti Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities, suppress adversary Long Range Fires, and engage other high payoff/time sensitive targets.  The LRHW Integrated System contractor will integrate Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies (CHGBs) with 2 stage boosters into canisters to create LRHW All Up Rounds (AUR) as detailed in the following sections and a build a prototype LRHW System. A leave behind prototype LRHW system is expected as an Early Operational Capability (EOC).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) will provide a ground-based weapon system designed to acquire, track, engage, and defeat the Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Rockets, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats. The IFPC Inc 2 requirement consists of a launcher, integrated fire control, sensor, and an interceptor to support the Threshold CM and UAS defeat mission and Objective counter-RAM mission with alternative kinetic and non-kinetic defeat solutions. The EMAM program supports IFPC Inc 2 by providing a kinetic interceptor capability against CM, UAS, and enabling an initial counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) capability. The IFPC Inc 2 and EMAM systems will be integrated with the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) Command and Control (C2) architecture.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funds supporting CFT Network efforts were previously requested in program Cross Functional Team (CFT) Advanced Development &amp; Prototyping, OSD PE 0604020A.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT) narrows assigned Army capability gaps using Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities - Policy (DOTMLPF-P) enhancements to enable overmatch. The N-CFT engages in expert analysis, focused experiments, and technology demonstrations to narrow capability gaps. Subsequent to a materiel development decision, the N-CFT develops and refines capability documentation aligned with the appropriate phase of the program. The N-CFT will inform technology transitions, research and development, and user assessments, and then rapidly transition Operational Requirements into the Army Acquisition System.  The N-CFT will integrate and synchronize activities across the Army, tied to Joint requirements, focused to improve speed, capability, and cost of materiel solutions to meet the Chief of Staff of the Army's (CSA's) first order principles, characteristics, and Warfighting requirements.

Unified Network Transport supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network; LOE 2 - Common Operating Environment (COE); LOE 3 - Interoperability; and LOE 4 - Command Post Mobility and Survivability. Funds will (1) identify and acquire technologies to address identified gaps across the Lines of Effort in the Integrated Tactical Network/Enterprise Network, Tactical Network Transport, Computing Environments, Interoperability and Command Posts, and (2) conduct demonstrations and experimental testing in lab and operational environments on the technologies. Successful solutions identified through the experimentation will be transitioned to Programs of Record for integration and fielding. Funds for experimentation will also support integration with solutions identified in the other Modernization CFT efforts to ensure their network dependencies are addressed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>LOE 3 (Interoperability) enables Unified Action Partner Interoperability through integration into the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Mission Partner Environment (MPE). Interoperability is the ability to routinely act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational, and strategic objectives. Interoperability between disparate forces allows coalitions to produce greater combat power than the sum of their parts by leveraging relative strengths while mitigating relative weaknesses. 

This funding is used to identify and acquire technologies to enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 3, Interoperability, solutions for experimentation that will incorporate abilities to leverage common commercial standards and/or widely recognized military interoperability standards. This funding will support demonstrations and experimentations, in a relevant operational environment, of key research and development (R&amp;D) and science and technology (S&amp;T) initiatives related to this effort, to include communications, information systems and information management; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; intelligence fusion; digital fires; and sustainment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Also, this funding initiates identifying multiple classification levels and access on Mission Partner Environment (MPE) solutions for experimentation. FY20 funding supports joint interoperability assessment during JWA 20 and DEFENDER 20. Subsequent funding support enables the Army to identify potential solutions for the following: enabling technologies to support the Army operating in an MPE; a deployed Army solution to extend episodic MPEs into the tactical network; and implementing solutions to UAP information exchange gaps (data, message and waveform Interoperability). Technologies with successful results will be transitioned in FY21-25 to a rapid acquisition initiative or into an existing PoR strategy.</r2:Text>

Project BT1 is Interoperability which supports N-CFT LOE 3
Project BT2 is Command Post Mobility/Survivability which supports N-CFT LOE 4
Project BT3 is Common Operating Environment which supports N-CFT LOE 2
Project BT4 is Network Technology Maturation Initiatives which supports N-CFT LOE 1 through 4
Project BT5 is Integrated Tactical Network/Integrated Enterprise Network which supports N-CFT LOE 1</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>LOE4, Command Posts (CPs), establishes capabilities that enable the ability to employ CPs for operations from early entry to major combat operations.  This LOE includes the ability to develop and disseminate a common operating picture, conduct planning and collaboration, synchronize operations, and modify and reduce the electronic and physical signatures. Solutions to solve current issues of lengthy set-up and tear-down times, survivability, mobility, suitability and physical size are also resolved in this LOE.  A key deliverable is an integrated body of requirements that meet operational needs in all aspects of CP operations. 

This funding is used to identify and acquire technologies for experimentation that enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 4, Command Post, in the overall Integrated Tactical Network. The Command Post LOE will focus on developing and obtaining approval of requirements for integrated command posts, then delivering these integrated command post designs to Army units.

                                        <r2:Text>FY20 funding initiates survivable command post solutions that enable dispersed CP footprint, reduced CP EM vulnerability, and extensible CP decoys for deception. Also, subsequent funding will support experimentation that identifies potential solutions for the following: Expeditionary tactical servers, integrated roll-on/roll-off kits, automated management and monitoring software to provision and manage command post; enhanced hardware operating at multiple classification levels pending availability of cross domain solution; technology enhancements addressing gaps discovered through the delivery of CP Directed Requirement capabilities, and the development and delivery of Integrated CP Designs that provide agility, mobility, and protection.  Technologies with successful results will be transitioned in FY21-25 into an existing PoR strategy for integration and fielding.</r2:Text>

Project BT1 is Interoperability which supports N-CFT LOE 3
Project BT2 is Command Post Mobility/Survivability which supports N-CFT LOE 4
Project BT3 is Common Operating Environment which supports N-CFT LOE 2
Project BT4 is Network Technology Maturation Initiatives which supports N-CFT LOE 1 through 4
Project BT5 is Integrated Tactical Network/Integrated Enterprise Network which supports N-CFT LOE 1</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>LOE 2, Common Operating Environment (COE), creates an approved set of standards, computing technologies, integrated data and databases, common graphics and a unified set of mission command applications.  It allows warfighters to adapt and configure the network as conditions change. 

Funding enhances Common Operating Environment Interoperability by enabling integration into the Joint Information Environment (JIE) and the Mission Partner Environment (MPE).  N-CFT COE enhancements will demonstrate a simple and intuitive single mission command suite (single common operating picture of common unified data and geospatial standards) installed, operated and maintained by soldiers, and standardized mission command applications and knowledge management capabilities that support leaders and Soldiers across echelons to enable all warfighting functions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This funding is used to identify and acquire technologies to enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 2, Common Operating Environment, in the overall Integrated Network. This LOE creates an approved set of standards, computing technologies, integrated data and databases and common graphics and a unified set of mission command applications. It will also support collaboration using a common picture with joint and coalition mission partners. This LOE delivers an integrated body of requirements that meet operational needs. The decisive action within this LOE is informing the next version of COE in FY21.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unified Network, enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. This effort has three components: Integrated Tactical Network, Network Enablers and Integrated Enterprise Network. It includes the development of a standards-based network architecture that unifies enterprise and deployed network capabilities and features a unified transport layer, network operations and other enabling functions that allows integration of disparate networks. The Army network will provide resiliency through path diversity and dynamic routing to ensure tactical units can communicate in hostile environments. It will provide multiple ways to communicate and give commanders the ability to choose their communications methods and tools during operations. It fully incorporates cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that support the employment of the network as a weapon system.

This funding is used to identify and acquire technologies to enhance or address gaps associated with LOE 1, Unified Network, for experimentation and demonstration in the overall Integrated Network. The Unified Network LOE enables a converged Mission Command Network that operates seamlessly worldwide and in any environment. It will increase bandwidth and range; improve mobility and network security; and harden the network. This will require the creation of a standards-based network architecture that effectively integrates enterprise and deployed network capabilities across domains and environments, and features a unified transport layer that permits "plug and play" for specific network capabilities. LOE 1 addresses the following operational requirements: Converged Mission Command Network, Network Augmentation / Extension, and Synthetic Training Environment.

LOE 1 enhancements include Aerial Tier (WGS Ka Band Surrogate), CEMA resiliency, and cyber hardened communications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FY20 funding supports identifying solutions for network fail-over in a contested environment to enable PACE (Primary, Alternate Contingency &amp; Emergency) and demonstrate rapid restoration capability for a denied WGS NCW tactical communications network which supports BLOS communications  between Division, Brigade, Battalion and Company echelons with high altitude balloon satellite surrogates. Restoring the NCW network provides resiliency to communications, including LRPF. Also, this funding supports demonstration and acquisition plans for experimentation of potential solutions for the following: Accelerate Next Generation Tactical radio, Air to ground integration, Secure LTE capabilities for mounted/ dismounted soldiers, and Tactical Network Operations (NetOps), Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) and Tactical Identity and Access Management (IdAM).Technology enhancements will provided Integrated Multi-Transport Capabilities, High Capacity Line of Sight Backhaul Radios, Line Of Sight Communications Range Extension, Electronic Protection of Tactical Communications, Network Gateways,Tactical NetOps Tools, Distributed Computing Tools, and High Capacity Transport for Heavy Mobile Platforms. Technologies with successful results will be transitioned in FY21-25 to a rapid acquisition initiative or into an existing PoR strategies.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Integrated Base Defense (IBD) provides integration of software and analytical capability to support the integration of systems in the field.  IBD employs an enterprise approach to enable IBD capabilities across the operational spectrum by leveraging interoperability efforts in support of the Integrated Unit, Base, and Installation Protection framework focused on system engineering and software development.

Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is an integrated suite of systems developed in response to CENTCOM JUONS CC-0540. CVBIED provides an early VBIED detection capability prior to vehicles reaching entry into Forward Operating Bases. Additional sensor systems are being integrated into the current Force Protection infrastructure as part of CVBIED.

Counter Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (CVBIED) is not a new start, the program was moved from Program Element 0605033A in FY18 and 0205402A in FY19.

Request for FY2020 OCO is $2.000M to support continued integration of CVBIED technologies into the current Force Protection infrastructure to address capabilities gaps within JUONS CC-0540.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability with access to existing Cyber Training Ranges (CTR) and available training resources and content. The current environment does not have the capacity to maintain a persistent environment and is primarily used for major exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag). The service cyber components have established their own training environments but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, "Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations," dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE. Program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645.

FY 2020 will focus on the requirements of the PCTE fielded capabilities, the build out of Technical Operations Management, and the extension of the PCTE to the National Guard and Reserve Cyber Mission Force teams.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) will provide the Department of Defense (DoD) cyber forces with a standardized training capability with access to existing Cyber Training Ranges (CTR) and available training resources and content. The current environment does not have the capacity to maintain a persistent environment and is primarily used for major exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag). The service cyber components have established their own training environments but do not have standardized capabilities or content. PCTE system approaches are aligned to the outputs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD AT&amp;L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) J6 led, "Cyber Range Evaluation of Alternatives (EOA) Findings and Issue Paper Deliberations," dated 17 November 2015. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) was designated as the DoD Acquisition Lead for the PCTE. Program is directed by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1645.

FY2020 will focus on the requirements of the PCTE fielded capabilities, the build out of Technical Operations Management, and the extension of the PCTE to the National Guard and Reserve CMF teams.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) program will employ an incremental acquisition strategy. The strategy leverages the use of existing cyber contract and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) vehicles to provide specified capabilities that will be integrated into a cohesive training platform. PCTE will provide iterative capability in prototypes provided to the Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) in drops that either improve or add features. These capability drops will be based on requirements contained and further developed as part of the PCTE Information System Capability Development Document (IS CDD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan - Line of Effort 1, 17 Apr 2018.

Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) will provide the Army's ground maneuver forces access to trusted PNT information under conditions where space-based PNT Global Positioning System (GPS) may be limited or denied.  Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memo (JROCM) 049-10, dated 05 Apr 2010, approved the Positioning, Navigation and Timing Assurance Initial Capabilities Document and designated the Army as the Lead Component for Assured PNT. The Material Development Decision (MDD) was approved on 30 Jul 2013.  The Assured PNT draft Capabilities Development Document was validated by the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) on 28 Jul 2014.  The Assured PNT Cross Functional Team is drafting individual requirements for each product.  The Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) Directed Requirement was approved 13 Jan 2019.

Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) is a critical enabler of many Army systems. The current Global Positioning System (GPS) capability is a fixed frequency system vulnerable to current and emerging threats, and field conditions (e.g. urban, dense vegetation), which means Warfighter assured access to and integrity of the PNT signal is not guaranteed.  This situation degrades mission performance to an unacceptable level. Therefore, current Army systems cannot operate in an electronically contested or degraded environment at the required PNT Assurance Levels with GPS alone.

A-PNT consists of five projects; (FJ8) Assured PNT, (FJ9) Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS), (FK1) Pseudolite, (FK2) Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS), and (FK3) Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS).  These A-PNT projects support access to and integrity of PNT information.  Project Manager (PM) PNT manages these five project (Assured PNT, DAPS, Pseudolite, MAPS, and AJAS) constructed to investigate, prototype, experiment, model, asses, develop, test, modify, field, and sustain A-PNT solutions.

Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) consists of:
(FJ8) - The Assured PNT project funding line is for: PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing to validate performance of end-to-end system performance; Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) upgrades to legacy GPS systems.  In addition, this line supports the development of complementary and adjacent A-PNT technologies as well as Enterprise Enablers including the Alternative Navigation (ALT NAV) signal Enterprise Build-out.  These technologies will be integrated into future products, strategies, concepts of operation, architectures, and platforms to assure PNT.

(FJ9) - The Dismounted A-PNT System (DAPS) provides assured PNT data to Soldier borne equipment (e.g. Nett Warrior, and other Soldier architecture compliant systems). DAPS is a Size, Weight, and Power, optimized military GPS, fused with other sensors.

(FK1)  - The Pseudolite project was terminated by the Army on 12 Feb 2019 after the Fiscal Year 2020 submission lock.  Therefore, the Army will realign FK1 funding within the existing PE 1206120A.  The requirements addressed by the Pseudolite solution are still valid capability gaps.  Pseudolite funding and activities will pivot to support the broader mission of Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection to mitigate threats in Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).  For FY21 a new project line will be established to transition the effort of Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection.  These technologies provide agile and adaptive mechanisms for integrating sensors, signals and software to provide Radio Frequency (RF) and non-RF threat mitigation.

(FK2) - The Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS) provides assured PNT data under conditions where space-based PNT (e.g. GPS) may be limited or denied by fusing non-RF sensors with GPS.  It distributes assured PNT data to tactical command, communication and control systems on Army tactical and combat vehicles.  

(FK3) - The Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) provides protection against jamming threats.  The AJAS is tightly coupled with the MAPS to provide GPS signal protection and assured PNT in challenged environments on Army tactical and combat vehicles.  

FY 2020 Base funds in the total amount of $192.562 million are provided to continue the development of the Assured PNT program. The FJ8 funding line accounts for $42.379 million for PNT System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) Testing, Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM), ALT NAV Enterprise Build-out and continued development of Assured PNT Enterprise Enablers. The FJ9 funding line accounts for $32.360 million to continue prototype development and testing for the DAPS. The FK1 funding line accounts for $42.452 million to continue to fulfill the assured PNT information gap by pivoting to Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection, accelerating the Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS), and aligning to Army Modernization priorities.  As a result, this funding will be realigned to FJ8 ($18.139 million) and FK2 ($24.313) million. The FK2 funding line accounts for $66.471 million to continue integration, training and Soldier assessment of MAPS on selected combat vehicles and command, control and communication systems. The FK3 funding line accounts for $8.900 million to continue integration, training and Soldier Assessment of AJAS, fielded with MAPS on selected combat vehicles and command, control, and communication systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The planned acquisition strategy for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System of Systems Architecture (SOSA) testing and Resiliency and Software Assurance Measures (RSAM) implementation is to award sole source contracts to the original equipment manufacturers and leverage the Communications Electronics Research Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) to develop and evaluate solutions to enhance the resiliency of Global Positioning System (GPS)-dependent systems operating in evolving contested environments. PNT SOSA testing and RSAM implementation will complete software development for Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), Ground Based GPS Receiver Applications Module (GB-GRAM), and MicroGRAM to include engineering build testing and formal qualification testing, as well as integration and integration testing, for platforms utilizing DAGR, GB-GRAM and MicroGRAM engineering builds.

The Assured PNT Enterprise Enablers project will conduct market research, prototyping, experimentation, and technical demonstrations of Alternative Navigation (ALT NAV), emerging situational awareness capabilities and net-enabled GPS solutions. These solutions will leverage commercial capabilities, existing contracts, industry, academia, and the warfighter in an iterative process, that will be integrated into future products, strategies, concepts of operation, architectures, and platforms to assure PNT.

The Assured PNT Enterprise Build-out will conduct network integration, installation and testing of the assured timing/location modular enterprise capability for ALT NAV.  ALT NAV provides positioning, navigation and timing data in a denied or degraded environment.  Enterprise Buildout will be completed to enable ALT NAV capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan - Line of Effort 1, 17 Apr 2018.

The Dismounted Assured PNT (A-PNT) System (DAPS) acquires, protects, and distributes secure PNT to the Dismounted Soldier. DAPS will be used in conjunction with the PEO Soldier Nett Warrior System Ensemble (e.g., Nett Warrior and other Soldier architecture compliant systems). DAPS is planned to be a size, weight and power (SWaP) optimized form-factor that paces the threats and includes development and integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and non-GPS sensors. DAPS includes receiver software capable of acquiring alternative PNT signals resulting in additional integrity for military GPS in denied environments and includes a Selective, Availability, Anti-Spoof module (SAASM) and or Military-Code (M-Code) receiver solution with other future technologies.

FY 2020 Base funds in the amount of $32.360 million are provided to deliver DAPS prototypes, conduct product verification testing as well as a series of testing events to include performance and reliability. In parallel to these activities, ongoing integration with the Nett Warrior End User Device will occur.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Dismounted A-PNT program is to provide the Soldier conducting operations outside of vehicles unhindered access to trusted PNT under conditions where space based PNT may be limited or denied, as well as a means to maintain accurate position, velocity, and time information in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged or degraded/denied environments. The Dismounted A-PNT capability will provide improved performance and reliability, availability, and maintainability over the currently fielded Defense Advanced GPS Receiver.  

The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units. This will be implemented by utilizing competitive Other Transaction Authority (OTA)'s to obtain prototypes. The Government will conduct laboratory and performance testing. The findings from these efforts will provide technology viability and allow for the transition to limited production. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan - Line of Effort 1, 17 Apr 2018.

The Pseudolite project was terminated by the Army on 12 Feb 2019 after the Fiscal Year 2020 submission lock.  Therefore, the Army will realign FK1 funding within the existing PE 1206120A.  The requirements addressed by the Pseudolite solution are still valid capability gaps.  Pseudolite funding and activities will pivot to support the broader mission of Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection to mitigate threats in Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).  For FY21 a new project line will be established to transition the effort of Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection. These technologies provide agile and adaptive mechanisms for integrating sensors, signals and software to provide Radio Frequency (RF) and non-RF threat mitigation.

FY 2020 Base funds in the amount of $42.452 million will continue to fulfill the assured PNT information gap by pivoting to Alternative PNT &amp; Area Protection, accelerating the Mounted A-PNT System (MAPS), and aligning to Army Modernization priorities.  As a result, this funding will be realigned to FJ8 ($18.139 million) and FK2 ($24.313 million).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan - Line of Effort 1, 17 Apr 2018.

The Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) System (MAPS) provides assured PNT data, is a key enabler, and a cross cutting capability for Army ground maneuver forces to execute their mission in support of the Network Enabling Function. Army ground maneuver Forces require access to assured PNT under conditions where space-based PNT (e.g. Global Positioning System (GPS)) may be limited or denied by fusing non-Radio Frequency (RF) sensors with GPS.  It distributes assured PNT data to tactical command, communication and control systems on Army tactical and combat vehicles.  The current GPS capability is a fixed frequency system which is vulnerable to current and emerging threats and field condition.

The MAPS is a scalable, upgradable system mounted on Army ground force platforms.  It fuses GPS with complimentary navigation and timing technologies to provide assured PNT to client systems and platforms. The MAPS distributes PNT data to multiple systems directly and via the network, reducing the dependency on multiple GPS receiver devices on a single platform. In order to achieve performance requirements in the highest threat level conditions, an Anti-Jam Antenna will be integrated with the MAPS. These two products each provide a degree of A-PNT protection.  Integrated together, however, these two products will close the capability gap and achieve the desired performance. 

FY 2020 Base funds, in the amount of $66.471 million, are provided for integration, installation, training and Soldier assessment of MAPS on selected combat vehicles and command, control and communication systems. Integration activities are required for 81 unique platforms and 27 client systems based on the current basis of issue (BOI).  In addition, FY2020 Base funds under PE 1206120A (project FK1) in the amount of $24.313 million are to be realigned to support MAPS acceleration and to align MAPS to Army Modernization priorities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) System (MAPS) program is to deliver distributed assured PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization.  The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps.  Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units.  This will be implemented by utilizing a competitive Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing, as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL), anechoic chamber testing and a Military Feasibility Assessment (MFA).  The findings from these tests and assessment efforts will determine whether or not to begin platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan - Line of Effort 1, 17 Apr 2018.

The Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) provides point protection by steering electronic nulls at interference sources or beams at valid signal sources. This enables continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) signal acquisition and tracking in a navigation warfare (jamming) environment. The AJAS is tightly coupled with the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS) to provide GPS signal protection and assured PNT in challenged environments on Army tactical and combat vehicles.  The AJAS integration with the MAPS will achieve performance requirements in the highest threat level conditions.  These two products each provide a degree of A-PNT protection.  Integrated together, however, these two products will close the capability gap and achieve the desired performance. 

FY 2020 Base funds in the amount of $8.900 million provide integration, installation, training and Soldier assessment of AJAS fielded with MAPS on selected combat vehicles and command, control and communication systems. Integration activities are required for 81 unique platforms and 27 client systems based on the current basis of issue (BOI).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The goal of the Anti-Jam Antenna System (AJAS) program is to deliver distributed A-PNT capabilities to mounted platforms over time in an iterative, affordable manner that allows for future modernization. The first iteration of capabilities will employ tailored processes to identify and close key technology gaps. Technologies available from Industry today will be evaluated for performance and operational suitability and equipped to select critical units. This will be implemented by utilizing a competitive Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to obtain prototypes.  The Government will conduct partial Electromagnetic Interference and Environmental Testing, as well as performance testing in the System Integration Lab (SIL), anechoic chamber testing and a Military Feasibility Assessment. The findings from these test and assessment efforts will determine whether or not to proceed to platform integration. Providing initial equipment to specified units will result in an assessment to determine production and fielding readiness of the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Friendly Force Data Integration and Management (FFDIM) Capability Definition Package (CDP), a Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) requirements document (October 2017) validated the Joint Friendly Force Tracking (JFFT) Testbed's development, testing and integration capabilities and Friendly Force Tracking (FFT) System Expert support provided by U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) as U.S. Strategic Command's (USSTRATCOM's) Army Service Component Command (ASCC). In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3910 (FFT Operations Guidance) directs USSTRATCOM's ASCC to execute eight specified FFT mission support responsibilities that include providing a testing and development capability to support joint, interagency and coalition partners FFT operations.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT: Headquarters, Department of the Army General Order 37, dated 16 October 2006, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army proponent for space, the Army integrator for global missile defense (GMD), and the Army Service Component Command (ASCC) of the USSTRATCOM. Army Regulation (AR) 10-87, Army Commands, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units, dated 4 September 2007, and AR 5-22, The Army Force Modernization Proponent System, dated 19 August 2009, designated USASMDC/ARSTRAT as the Army specified proponent for Space/High Altitude capabilities. As the Army proponent for space and high altitude, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is responsible for developing warfighting concepts, conduct warfighting experiments to validate those concepts, identify capabilities needed to implement the validated concepts, and develop Doctrine, Organizations, Training, Material, Leadership &amp; Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) solutions.

Project FE5 funds USASMDC/ARSTRAT efforts to develop, analyze and mature warfighting concepts, and conduct warfighting experiments for space and high altitude capabilities. USASMDC/ARSTRAT is the proponent for space/high altitude capabilities and is responsible for determining and integrating DOTMLPF-P for the Army.  The program also funds development and integration of new data sources and services into the JFFT Mission Management Center (MMC), providing users FFT information system services at the highest Mission Assurance Category level (MAC 1). Software products developed and deployed by the JFFT Testbed into the MMC enable the receipt, integration and dissemination of real-time FFT information to the Common Operating Picture (COP) displays for Combatant Commanders, Joint Task Forces and coalition partners.  JFFT Subject Matter Expert support to critical FFT interoperability assessments and development activities with coalition partners are supporting DOD's priority of strong alliances and partnerships.  Integrated FFT data solutions developed by JFFT Testbed enable FFT data for COP display and Situational Awareness between Army forces and Unified Action Partners.  The JFFT Testbed will continues to leverage FFT systems expertise and reduce Department of Defense costs by supporting numerous efforts, including the joint Personnel Recovery community response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement to resolve critical issues in isolated persons reporting and locating.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

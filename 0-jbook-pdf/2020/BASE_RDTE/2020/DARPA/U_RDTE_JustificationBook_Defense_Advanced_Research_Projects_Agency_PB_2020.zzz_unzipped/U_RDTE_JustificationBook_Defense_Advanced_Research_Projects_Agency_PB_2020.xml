            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.

The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security requirements.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national security and homeland defense.

The Cyber Sciences project supports long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grow in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project will produce breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.

The Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.

The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.

The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security.  Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health, as well as create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD.  However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.  The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges:  (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; and (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at city scale and will significantly improve DoD ability to assess intent, deception, and other social behaviors.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program is developing data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models.  Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits.  In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models.  The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.  SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design, which will impact future DoD capabilities in areas such as chemical and biological defense, and warfighter readiness.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales.  The world is highly interdependent, and disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have severe consequences.  The World Modelers capability is focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings of impending catastrophe.  Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts.  The World Modelers program is developing techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs.  Advances in machine reading and learning, semantic technologies, big data analysis, geo-spatial and economic modeling, and environmental simulation bring this strategic capability within reach.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust will develop foundational mathematical, computational, and multi-physics theories, approaches and tools to better represent, quantify and model complex DoD systems from multimodal data analysis through part/system design and fabrication.  One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets.  Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.  Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available.  Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems. Another focus area of this thrust is multi-physics models for predicting behavior and non-intuitive failure pathways for complex, dynamic physical systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Communicating With Computers (CWC) program is advancing human-computer interaction by enabling computers to comprehend language, gesture, facial expression and other communicative modalities in context.  Since the very beginning of the field, artificial intelligence has sought to create machines that can use language, interact naturally with humans, and form abstractions and concepts.  Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend strongly on perception of the physical world and shared context to communicate efficiently.  CWC will provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense the physical world, encode the physical world in a perceptual structure, and link language to this perceptual encoding.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding, which are essential for human communication.  CWC will also extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts and virtual constructs.  These CWC advances in foundational areas of artificial intelligence will contribute to future military capabilities in robotics and command and control.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continued operation.  BRASS will create tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.</r2:Description>

Concurrent with the recent explosion of interest in ML, deception attacks that manipulate a ML system into an erroneous response have also emerged.  While such deception attacks against ML have become sophisticated and varied, the development of defensive capabilities for ML systems has not been maintained.  The GARD program will address the growing need for defensive ML capabilities by developing techniques to establish robustness properties of ML systems, and to defend against possible attacks.  The techniques developed under RAIAD will be essential if the DoD is to rely on ML systems in contested environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program will explore approaches to enable commonsense reasoning by machines.  Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in exciting new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and two-person strategy games such as Chess and Go.  In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation.  General machine commonsense reasoning, on par with human cognition, remains elusive.  MCS will develop computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; develop simulated interaction and learning environments to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and develop a commonsense knowledge repository to support AI system development.  AI systems that are capable of more human-like reasoning will be able to behave reasonably in unforeseen situations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) program, addressing a key issue encountered by the Data-Driven Discovery of Models program (budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13), will develop technology to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required to train machine learning (ML) systems.  In supervised ML, the system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech.  Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data.  With enough labeled data on which to train ML systems, it is generally possible to build useful models, but training accurate models currently requires large amounts of labeled data that can be costly to obtain.  LwLL will address this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation.  LwLL-based ML systems will be easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments.</r2:Description>

One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse and noisy data.  Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems.  A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated molecular discovery.  The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, and other DoD relevant applications.</r2:Description>

The world is moving faster than humans can assimilate, understand, and act.  At present, we design machines to handle well-defined, high-volume or high-speed tasks, freeing humans to focus on complexity.  If successful, HMS will bring forth technologies that enable machines to do more than execute pre-programmed instructions.  Rather, HMS-enabled machines will: 1) understand speech; 2) extract information contained in diverse media; 3) learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; 4) identify and work to fill knowledge gaps; 5) extrapolate causal phenomena to anticipate predictable outcomes; and 6) respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.

                                <r2:Description>The Alternative Computing thrust will explore and develop new computational primitives for modeling and simulating complex systems.  Despite decades of rapid advancement in electronic computing, there remain important national security relevant challenge problems that do not lend themselves to achieving tractable solutions under size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained conditions.  For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources.  Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust, also in this PE/Project, the goal of the Alternative Computing thrust is to develop novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to enable fast and accurate simulations for problems that are practically intractable using electronic computers.  Approaches considered under this thrust include the following: (1) analog computing substrates for efficiently simulating systems governed by complex non-linear phenomena; (2) multi-functional spin-based devices for scalable, efficient neuromorphic computing; (3) computing approaches that exploit the capacity of nonlinear systems to simulate nonlinear dynamical systems; and (4) quantum enabled simulations of complex phenomena in physics, chemistry and materials.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program will research and develop fundamentally new machine learning mechanisms, enabling machines that learn continuously as they operate.  Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.  The L2M program moves to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

Mastering these domains requires the capability to create abstract, causal models from massive volumes of diverse data.  Current modeling approaches are heavily reliant on human insight and expertise, but the complexity of these models will soon exceed the capacity for human comprehension.  Big Mechanism created technologies to: extract and normalize information for incorporation in flexible knowledge bases; build reasoning engines that can infer general rules from a collection of observations; and develop knowledge synthesis techniques to create models of extreme complexity consistent with huge volumes of data.  Big Mechanism applications accommodate an operator-in-the-loop to clarify ambiguities and reconcile detected inconsistencies.  The program focused on cancer modeling due to the availability of experimental data.  The complexity of this problem is representative of challenges facing the DoD in areas such as cyber attribution and open-source intelligence.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program is developing techniques to detect algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities and side channel attacks in software.  Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks, so cyber adversaries are now finding new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws.  The STAC program seeks to develop analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these new attacks in the software on which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The SafeWare program developed new code obfuscation techniques for protecting software from reverse engineering.  At present, adversaries can extract sensitive information from stolen software, which could include cryptographic private keys, special inputs/failsafe modes, and proprietary algorithms.  Today's state-of-the-art in software obfuscation adds junk code (loops that do nothing, renaming of variables, redundant conditions, etc.) that is not resilient against automated tools.  Recent breakthroughs in theoretical cryptography have the potential to make software obfuscation into a mathematically rigorous science, very much like what the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm did for the encryption of messages in the 1970s.  In its present form, cryptographic obfuscation incurs too much runtime overhead to be practical.  The SafeWare program took this very early-stage obfuscation theory and increased its practicality and efficiency.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.

Within this project, Beyond Scaling programs will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling).  Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems.  Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon.  Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through vertical circuit integration for improved computation or non-volatile memory devices that combine computation and memory.  Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Beyond Scaling programs move to Project ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW).  Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry.  This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the Size, Weight, And Power (SWaP) of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials and provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications.  For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including hard-to-jam wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The SHort Range Independent Microrobotics Program (SHRIMP) will develop microrobots with the ability to enter constrained disaster areas such as collapsed buildings for search and rescue operations.  These sugar cubed-sized microrobots could obtain local sensing data to assist with location of injured persons or critical infrastructure failures.  The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of Olympic-themed events at the end of the program.  The primary technical developments needed are in the efficiency, robustness, and control of millimeter-scale actuators, which allow the robots to move using new materials, processing, and sensor integration techniques, and in the power and energy capacity of batteries, which provide the power required for the microrobot to move and sense stimuli.  Complete platforms will require access controls for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size.

                                <r2:Description>The Atomic-Photonic Integration (A-PhI) program, building on technology developed in the Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program, aims to reduce the complexity of atomic clocks and gyroscopes by using integrated photonics for Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications.  A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device.  PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.  While PNT needs are usually met by using the Global Positioning System, GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential.  Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term.  However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications, sensing, and radar systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  HAVOC will fund basic research in vacuum electronics to improve understanding of the various phenomena governing vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at mm-wave frequencies above 75 GHz.  Focus areas will include modeling and simulation techniques, advanced manufacturing methods, novel beam-wave interaction structures, high current density and long-life cathodes, and other relevant topics.

                                <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to identify, investigate, and demonstrate inertial sensor technologies for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Applied research efforts are funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Signal Processing at RF (SPAR) program will investigate advanced analog components to process radio frequency (RF) signals for communications, radar, and electronic warfare applications.  Today, electronic components are limited in their ability to distinguish between two or more signals operating at the same frequency when one signal is strong enough to jam the others.  The jamming signal, in this case, saturates the receiver electronics much like loud music drowns out a quiet conversation.  By using advancements in new semiconductor materials, processing, and novel signal interaction mechanisms, SPAR components will be able to pick out friendly RF signals from both intentional and unintentional jamming signals, even when those signals sit on top of one another in frequency.  This capability would enable a range of new applications including communications in contested battlefield RF environments, jamming the RF spectrum while maintaining communication, and full-duplex radio communication.  Other potential applications include equipping mobile radios with SPAR-enabled front ends for simultaneous jam-resistant two-way communication and electronic warfare.</r2:Description>

Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS leveraged recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program led to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.

Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Design program will investigate the design of application-specific circuit architectures that ensure continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of continued scaling in silicon transistors (Moore's Law).  Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware.  Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.  The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Design program moves to ES-02, Beyond Scaling Sciences, in FY 2019.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Beyond Scaling Sciences project will support investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will investigate new materials to support next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  These basic explorations include, novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program moved from Project ES-01, Electronic Sciences, in FY 2019.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-02.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Design program will investigate application-specific circuit architectures that ensure continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of continued scaling in silicon transistors (Moore's Law).  Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  Further research would also develop tools to create exact representations of physical hardware.  Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create specialized hardware and provide benefits by improving electronics systems that do not depend on continued rapid improvements in silicon transistors.

Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  Areas of research will include network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.

The program recognizes that the densely interconnected microsystems of the future will be built through the use of groundbreaking materials, revolutionary devices, advanced architectures, and unconventional computing.  JUMP will therefore sponsor academic research teams focused on related key technology areas that will impact future DoD capabilities and national security.  The JUMP program will not only push fundamental technology research but also establish long-range microelectronic research themes with greater emphasis on end-application and systems-level computation.  By discovering the science underlying new technologies and overcoming engineering challenges, JUMP will enable DoD applications to exploit the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) and to employ both distributed and centralized computing with embedded intelligence and memory.

Complex biological materials and systems have unique properties (e.g., controlled porosity and high strength-to-weight ratios) not only because of the inherent components but also because of how those components are assembled together across length scales.  Engineering biology tools and techniques are now at a stage to pursue the organization and function of multi-cellular systems for a new class of improved capabilities.  This program will develop underlying technological platforms to enable information-driven assembly of hierarchical multi-cellular systems for the development of advanced materials.  Advances in this program will impact military approaches to infrastructure design in austere environments as well as established methods for manufacture and maintenance of military platforms (e.g., tanks, planes, ships).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Based on initial research conducted under the Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program, the Biology for Security (BIOSEC) program seeks to investigate novel approaches to address the DoD need for rapid detection of unknown and/or emerging biological threats from state actors or violent extremist organizations (VEOs).  This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Native Bioelectronic Interfaces effort will address the DoD need for improving warfighter recovery from injury by developing technologies that can accelerate the restoration and repair of complex tissues.  This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed.  The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue.  The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing.  Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program was to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale and adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries developed the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries provided game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Living Foundries developed tools to simplify, abstract, and standardize the biological production pathway optimization process.  Additionally, Living Foundries identified the fundamental design rules that govern the construction and organization of underlying genetic elements in the production pathways.  Research thrusts included development of the fundamental tools, capabilities, and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  This resulted in rapid design, construction, implementation, and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality.  Applied research for this program was budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

An emerging field, engineering biology is focused on developing the tools to harness the powerful synthetic and functional capabilities of biology.  These tools facilitated design and biological production of new chemicals and materials, sensing capabilities, therapeutics, and numerous other applications.  This rapidly developing technological capability opened the door to new applications that have previously been out of reach, and offers substantial potential advantages in terms of cost and novel functionality.

Fundamental work in this area focused on understanding the underlying principles for engineering robust and safe microbes and microbial communities that perform as designed over the long-term.  This program also had applied research efforts funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02.</r2:Description>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring and preventing the spread of infectious disease.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling, and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  To enable in-theater, continuous analysis and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including the use of bacterial predators as therapeutics against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; developing techniques to enable rapid transient immunity for emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and leveraging fundamental biological mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Advances in this area may be used as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members.  Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance.  Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness.  The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust will investigate fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen.  Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses.  This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants.  Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a National Security risk as a potential pandemic.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Many emerging infectious disease outbreaks have origins in animal reservoirs and occur in areas where DoD personnel are deployed, putting them at high risk of endemic and emerging diseases.  The Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) program will investigate how animal pathogens are transmitted to humans and explore novel approaches to prevent these events.  Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans.  Promising intervention approaches will be developed to prevent viral species jumps from animal reservoirs to humans. Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs.</r2:Description>

Research efforts will apply advances in molecular and cellular biology, cell signaling, and biomaterials to develop new tools to alter the time course of pathological processes associated with infection and tissue damage.  This tactic is a departure from traditional therapeutic approaches that seek to control symptoms associated with active infections or innate physiological responses to tissue trauma.

                                <r2:Description>The Improved Interventions program seeks to develop novel pharmacological interventions to quickly and holistically optimize the performance of the healthy warfighter.  The status quo for pharmacological intervention is one drug, one target, which often has many undesirable side effects. This program will create a platform to develop pharmacological interventions capable of modulating multiple targets within biological systems of the body, which will reduce side effects and promote safety.  Research will focus on the integration of novel bioinformatics approaches, high-content physiological model systems, and new bio-orthogonal chemical synthesis methods to treat the system in order to achieve desired physiological effects. Progress in this area will lead to new pharmacological discovery and design principles that will lead to products that can be used to augment physical fitness training and maintenance for military populations.

                                <r2:Description>The Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program will explore new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases.  Research efforts in this area will apply recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness.  One approach to achieve this goal is identifying the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults.  Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species may be combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival.  By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, one may formulate a survival blueprint to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection.  This approach is orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention.  Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Biomedical Technology Program Element focuses on applied research for medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices.  Successful battlefield medical and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges to ensure warfighter readiness, including both resilience to infectious disease and neurotechnology for improved warfighter performance.  To maintain warfighter health, battlefield medical technologies research in this project will investigate disease forecasting, detection, and therapeutic response.  Example programs include a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak, identification of early infection biomarkers to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater, new methods to rapidly develop medical countermeasures in response to an emerging biothreat, and in-theater manufacturing capabilities for field-relevant pharmaceuticals to reduce the logistical burden and infrastructure requirements.  To improve warfighter performance, this project will develop new neural architectures and data processing algorithms to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Additionally, advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These tasks could be made less difficult with advanced neurotechnology platforms, but all such devices currently require invasive surgery to implement.  The Neural Signal Interfaces and Applications (NSIA) program will develop non-invasive neurotechnologies able to interface with the nervous system with high resolution and precision without surgery.  NSIA will utilize recent advances to transduce neural signals through tissue.  Resulting technologies will facilitate standard human-machine interfaces for improved workload balance between man and machine.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Military personnel are deployed all over the world for traditional operations, and are often specifically called upon in response to emerging or re-emerging disease outbreaks with pandemic potential (e.g., Ebola).  In both instances, the DoD needs effective countermeasures to protect its deployed forces and maintain warfighter readiness.  The Pandemic Prevention program is focusing on novel methods to rapidly accelerate countermeasure discovery, pre-clinical testing, and manufacturing.  This program seeks to advance and integrate newly developed approaches including bioinformatics assessment of genetic sequencing and nucleic acid-based vaccines and to address technology bottlenecks associated with each stage of medical countermeasure development.  Additional research will investigate new methods improving the manufacturability, distribution, and delivery of novel therapeutics.  Pandemic Prevention will enable an integrated therapeutic development platform that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to prevent disease outbreaks.</r2:Description>

FITE will investigate the ability to characterize epigenetic signatures in an individual's genome caused by specific exposures.  The program will create the framework for modular technology capable of performing forensic analysis using epigenetic information to provide high specificity of the type of exposure and when it occurred.  This novel capability could serve as a field-forward forensic tool for use by the DoD to assist in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat detection and response.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Wounded warriors often suffer from neural injury due to spinal cord injury or amputations.  Military personnel with amputated limbs get limited benefit from recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the user interface for controlling the limb is low-performance and unreliable.  Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor &amp; sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.  Research in this area will also address similar interface technologies with other nerve pathways such as the spinal cord.  The anticipated transition partner is the Army.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program is exploring and developing advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity.  One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies is the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior.  Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders.  Efforts under this program examine the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determine how to best ameliorate these disorders.  The objective for this program is to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices.  These tools will allow for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and will enable new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel.  Technologies of interest under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need, such as in a barracks or in a confined environment (e.g., submarine).  Research in this program will investigate new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure.  Additionally, this program will develop new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread.  Technologies developed in this program will enable clinically actionable information, even when an individual has no awareness of symptoms, and extend infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Restoration of Brain Function Following Trauma program exploited recent advances in the understanding and modeling of brain activity and organization to develop approaches to treat traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Critical to success was the ability to detect and quantify functional changes that occur in the human brain during the formation of distinct new memories, and to correlate those changes with subsequent recall of those memories during performance of behavioral tasks.  This program also developed neural interface hardware for monitoring and modulating neural activity responsible for successful memory formation in a human clinical population.  The ultimate goal was identification of efficacious therapeutic approaches that could bypass and/or recover the neural functions underlying memory, which are often disrupted as a consequence of TBI.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program was to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection by providing centralized laboratory capabilities at non-tertiary care settings.  ADEPT focused on the development of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-based vaccines, potentially eliminating the time and labor required for traditional manufacture of a vaccine while at the same time improving efficacy.  Additionally, ADEPT developed methods to transiently deliver nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, and kinetically control the timing and levels of gene expression so that these drugs will be safe and effective for use in healthy subjects.  ADEPT also focused on advanced development of key elements for simple-to-operate diagnostic devices.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

     The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications. Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.

    The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems. Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry.

   The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas could allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, should help develop new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program seeks to catalyze the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics.  SC2 will address the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 will address this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants will be challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 will conduct two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program is addressing the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications.  The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity by, for example, recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program is pursuing new hardware architectures and algorithms for improving the efficiency of graph and sparse data analytics.  When developing operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today are forced to reduce the scope of the problems that they can address and the tempo of their analyses due to the limitations of currently deployed hardware.  Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time.  The HIVE program moves to PE 0602716E/ Project ELT-02 in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Electronic Globalization effort aimed to develop advanced capabilities for validating the function of digital, analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits (IC) given limited design specifications.  These ICs are critical to nearly all military systems.  Globalization and rapid growth in the commercial electronics industry have limited DoD's ability to influence and regulate IC fabrication.  DoD today accounts for a relatively small portion of the overall IC market and the vast majority of IC manufacturing capacity lies overseas.  As a result, parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet the stated specifications for performance and reliability.  Electronic Globalization pursued the technologies required to address this and other risks to DoD IC's, such as reverse engineering, counterfeiting, and the theft of U.S. intellectual property.  The effort supported the development of key risk-reduction techniques including advanced imaging and computational methods for identifying an IC's functional elements.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks for DoD-scale information networks.  For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from a great many devices.  CHASE is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and automatically disseminate protective measures that bolster the collective cyber defense posture.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program is developing automated systems to enable a black start recovery of the U.S. power grid amidst a cyber attack on the energy sector's critical infrastructure.  This approach will enable skilled cyber and power engineers to rapidly restore electrical service after an attack that challenges the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations (e.g., utilities, balancing authorities, independent system operators, bulk power markets).  The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems.  RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing.  RADICS technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. government elements responsible for defense of critical infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources.  At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers, which brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program will develop a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so.</r2:Description>

The Computers and Humans Exploring Software Security (CHESS) program is developing technologies to enable computers and humans to reason collaboratively over software artifacts, such as source code and compiled binaries, with the goal of finding vulnerabilities more rapidly and accurately than unaided human operators.  CHESS envisions a future in which high-intensity cyber operations are conducted by computer-human teams.  CHESS capabilities will be designed for use by humans of varying skill levels, even those with no previous cyber experience or relevant domain knowledge.  Achieving the necessary scale and timelines in vulnerability discovery will require innovative combinations of automated program analysis techniques with support for advanced computer-human collaboration. Combining human-generated insight into the vulnerability discovery process with the speed and scale of computational analysis will be a critical enabler for U.S. operational cyber superiority.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is developing the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow system engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other nonfunctional properties when designing complex embedded computing systems.  The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber physical systems.  If successful, CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Active Social Engineering Defense (ASED) program is developing technologies to automatically identify, disrupt and investigate social engineering attacks via bot-mediated communications.  Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system.  At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls entirely to users.  ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications, and auto-identify attackers.  If successful, ASED will greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) program is developing new computer networking architectures that deter, detect, and overcome distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks include both high-volume flooding attacks and more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while exhausting server processing and memory.  These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will assimilate poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.  XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.</r2:Description>

In particular, distributed data centers with high-speed interconnects and customizable hardware including graphics processing units (GPU) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being used by service providers to achieve greater efficiency and improved processing performance.  MemOp will explore new memory architectures that more fully leverage emerging customizable hardware to deliver computing services reliably and at reduced cost.

Automated machine reading and analysis capabilities are required due to the extreme rates at which this text-based data is generated.  In addition, the connections between extracted entities and their activities can be very subtle and, because they are buried in noise, difficult to detect and correlate.

The CFAR program will combine techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that exhibit differences in behavior under cyber attack, so that CFAR-enabled computing systems will quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services.

EdgeCT algorithms and software prototypes are implemented exclusively at the network edge, specifically on end hosts and/or on proxy servers fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication.  This enables highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.  EdgeCT technologies are developed in coordination with operational commands and commercial service providers.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies.  Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems. The SSITH program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technology, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

Authenticating parts or detecting counterfeit components by current means has proven expensive, time-consuming, and of limited effectiveness.  An alternative solution, maintaining complete control of the global supply chain using administrative controls, can also incur substantial costs.  SHIELD instead sought to incorporate a small, inexpensive silicon chip ("dielet") into the packaging of genuine components.  The dielet provided unique and encrypted component identification, enabling authentication from very close proximity.  Since counterfeit electronic components pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of both commercial and DoD systems, SHIELD fulfilled a large, pressing, and evolving need for anti-counterfeit technologies.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to produce a rationale to explain the conclusions they reach.  If current trends continue, future U.S. military autonomous systems will need to perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions, and AI will be critical to such systems. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, or not meaningful to a human user.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation autonomous, data analytics, and decision-support systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety properties in uncertain environments.  Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments.  As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance.  Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.  The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources for use in environments where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data.  At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in only one interpretation with alternatives being eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence.  AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from multiple sources into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends.  If successful, AIDA will provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages.  The U.S. military operates globally, and frequently encounters low-resource languages, i.e., languages for which few linguists are available and no automated human language technology capability exists.  Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These capabilities will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

If successful, HMS technologies will enable machines to do more than execute pre-programmed instructions.  Rather, HMS-enabled machines will understand speech; extract information contained in diverse media; learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience; identify and work to fill knowledge gaps; extrapolate causal phenomena to anticipate predictable outcomes; and respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.

                                <r2:Description>The Automated Knowledge Acquisition (AKA) program will develop technologies to automate the integration of diverse sources of data and information into a unified whole.  A number of technologies now exist to extract, transform, and load diverse source data into a structured knowledge base.  However, each time a new source of data is encountered, a human engineer is required to map that source's metadata and schema to the metadata and schema of the target knowledge base. Performing this mapping is difficult even when design documentation for the source is available, and so it represents a significant barrier to data interoperability and knowledge acquisition.  AKA will leverage advances in semantic technology and machine learning to enable machines to perform the entire data integration function without human intervention.  AKA technology will automatically learn the semantics of a new data source, characterize source content, align source schema to the target, transform and load values, and reconcile inconsistencies by learning from previously integrated sources.  AKA technologies will automatically create and maintain, in real-time, broad knowledge of local and regional military, political, economic, social, and cultural information for warfighters in theater.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and address important national security challenge applications.  In particular, this program is focused on improving DoD processes that, because of the need for excessive human involvement, create bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities.  If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly reduce the time and cost associated with many important developmental, approval and certification processes.  One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to minimal human intervention.  Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems.  Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models.  AAI application areas include the following:  (1) machine-enabled techniques to reduce human engagement in determining trustworthiness and intent; (2) automated approaches for accreditation of military software systems; and (3) technologies to restore movement and sensation to central nervous system impaired patients.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning over Schemas (KAIROS) program will develop AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex event sequences.  For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society.  Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security.  Many important events are not simple occurrences but complex phenomena that are composed of numerous subsidiary event elements, some of which happen simultaneously while others are sequential and dependent on each other.  Humans make sense of event sequences by organizing them into narrative structures that may occur or re-occur frequently.  These structures are abstracted into schemas - organized units of knowledge that represent patterns - for the purpose of cognition. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies will enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately.</r2:Description>

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological, chemical and radiological threats included: countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack; collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors; and integrated defense systems.  This project also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Challenges in reducing U.S. vulnerability to these attacks include developing new sensors and systems that afford early warning and opportunities to interdict these threats before they can be employed in urban areas and other population centers.  A major goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide these wide-area monitoring capabilities for WMT threat signatures.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement (MAD-FIRES) program seeks to develop a point defense system against today's most stressing threats by developing a highly maneuverable, medium caliber, guided projectile, fire sequencing and control system capable of neutralizing large threat raids of high speed, highly maneuverable targets.  Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new system and as an upgrade to existing gun systems with applications to various domain platforms across a multitude of missions to include: ship self-defense, precision air to ground combat, precision ground to ground combat, counter unmanned air vehicles (C-UAV), and counter rocket and artillery and mortar (C-RAM).</r2:Description>

The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations.  Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention. In FY 2020, this program is also funded in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy.</r2:Description>

Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality.  This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, and will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level.  The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit.</r2:Description>

By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program will emphasize low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems.  Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program seeks to develop solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Formerly PDUE: Autonomous Building Search Persistent Deterrence in Urban Environments

The goal of the Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) program is to develop and demonstrate new autonomous agents and techniques that can rapidly discriminate hostile intent and filter out threats during missions ranging from minutes to hours, leveraging natural or created stimuli to elicit behavioral responses among humans in an area. The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact.  Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA will explore scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent. This mission will require the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments.  URSA will develop new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It will implement new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and will build a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Urban combat demands that riflemen also serve as combat engineers manipulating their local environment to gain tactical advantage.  The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment.  Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability.  The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research.  Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment.  The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Highly-Networked Dissemination of Relevant Data (3HNDRED) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of disseminating relevant, actionable information to the ground warfighter to enable effective accomplishment of mission objectives in a dynamic environment. Heterogeneous sensors, including soldier-borne, vehicle-borne, and manned or unmanned ground/air assets, may be netted together to form a complete picture of an area of interest.  A tactical decision engine will receive and process incoming sensor data to form an understanding of mission context, environment, and individual agent role and posture.  Based on this knowledge, the tactical decision engine will establish a contextually-relevant personalized operating picture for each node/individual in accordance with their current status and mission goal and then guide action (e.g. heading and urgency) via interface modalities appropriate to the current state. 3HNDRED will assess and integrate hands-free, heads-up interfaces to convey information to the warfighter that can be quickly detected and intuitively understood without cognitive burden, enabling rapid response. 3HNDRED will enable collaborative actions between dismounted and mounted elements across manned and unmanned teams, and support on-the-fly force re-composition, providing an asymmetric advantage to U.S. ground forces.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program sought to develop a small, lightweight, guided kinetic weapon for lightweight maneuver forces.  Current short-range weapons are used against a variety of target sets using different munitions without the benefit of active guidance.  Current long-range weapons are highly effective against a specific target set at range, but are too large or heavy to employ in needed numbers, have a high cost per shot/procurement cost, and often require burdensome logistics or dedicated specialized systems to use.  The program goal was to improve on the existing, lightweight unguided munition systems by increasing range, accuracy, and lethality, while reducing cost.  These improvements leveraged advances in miniaturization, precision guidance and warheads.  Precision Kinetic Light Strike sought to take advantage of commercial technologies whenever possible to provide a low-cost, multi-use, and multi-function precision engagement capability.  The Precision Kinetic Light Strike program will significantly increase the combat power of small units with reduced burden, while significantly reducing cost relative to near-peer and peer adversaries.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Control of Revolutionary Aircraft with Novel Effectors (CRANE) program will demonstrate revolutionary improvements in aircraft controls technology.  The program will design, build, and flight test an aircraft that is able to fly and maneuver at altitude with no moving control surfaces; relying on state of the art Active Flow Control (AFC) technology.  AFC is a broad term that encompasses a range of technology approaches; broadly defined, it is a control mechanism which alters the aerodynamic flow field thru ejection or suction of fluid via an orifice on a lifting body.  An emphasis of the program will be on assessing AFC component technologies, risk reduction and experimentation, integrated testing, fabrication and demonstration of a relevant scale novel and innovative aircraft.  Technologies, design tools and models developed and demonstrated under this program will be made available to all Services as well as the civilian aerospace sector for application to future air systems development.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The objective of the CounterSwarmAI program is to develop systems for anticipating and defeating autonomous systems threats of the future.  These adversary systems will likely employ advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques which will inevitably lead to increased complexity and unpredictability of these advanced threats. CounterSwarmAI envisions the development of disruptive technologies across the engagement kill chain, themselves AI-empowered, which directly combat these challenges. CounterSwarmAI decision software will directly interface with future and legacy defensive systems (kinetic and non-kinetic) to rapidly assess, optimally exploit, and efficiently defeat enemy autonomous systems threats. Innovative solutions will enable (a) autonomous systems which provide understanding and vulnerability exploitation through machine learning, (b) an integrated AI-equipped open architecture for multi-faceted swarm defense, and (c) integration and experimentation with live surrogate swarm threats against current fielded defensive systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program will design, develop, and demonstrate a kit enabling affordable, rapid automation of selected aircrew functions across a broad range of aircraft.  ALIAS intends to enable reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of on-board aircrew to improve performance.  The program will develop hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program will also develop tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS will leverage recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS will culminate in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allow a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments program is developing advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively design, plan, and manage missions in complex operational environments.  The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholder groups on civil, economic, and military matters.  These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities, and concerns that may differ significantly.  Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties.  This program will develop tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors.  These tools will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes, and phenomena.  The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by analysis of sensor and open source data.  The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited by a shortage of expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning.  D3M will address this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies will include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.  D3M will focus on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC.</r2:Description>

Monitoring and controlling WMT pathways is essential to denying access to WMT technology, knowledge, materials, expertise, and weapons.  MAA will create graph models reflecting prototypical WMT pathways, develop methods for creating merged activity graphs by aligning entities across multiple intelligence modalities, develop algorithms to match empirical activity graphs with pathway models, and create synthetic data sets at scale to support development and testing of WMT activity detection techniques.  MAA technology will transition to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) program will assist military decision makers with rapidly identifying and selecting options for tasking and re-tasking assets within and across organizational boundaries.  Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets.  Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations.  ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers.  The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.  Technology developed under this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Distributed Battle Management (DBM) program will develop mission-driven architectures, protocols, and algorithms for battle management (BM) in contested environments.  The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors onboard a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The DBM program will seek to develop a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture will enable rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintain a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program will incorporate highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-in-the-loop operator approval.  DBM technologies are expected to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Memex program developed search technologies to revolutionize the discovery, organization, and presentation of domain-specific content. Earlier search technologies were limited in search query format, retrieved content organization, and infrastructure support, and they imposed an iterative search process that was time-consuming and inefficient, producing only a fraction of the available information. Memex created a new domain-specific search paradigm that discovers relevant content and organizes it in ways that are more immediately useful to specific missions and tasks. In addition, Memex domain-specific search engines extend the reach of current search capabilities to the deep web and non-traditional content. Memex technologies enable the military, government, and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical information on the Internet and in large intelligence repositories. Mission areas addressed by Memex included counter-terrorism, counter-drug, anti-money-laundering, and anti-human-trafficking, with transition partners from DoD and other U.S. Government activities.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, and these attacks are typically handled by individual organizations as they occur. Analyzing network summary data across a wide array of networks can make it possible to identify trends and patterns visible only when the data is viewed as a whole. Network Defense developed novel algorithms and analysis tools that enable a big picture approach for identifying illicit behavior in networks. This analysis and subsequent feedback to system administrators, security engineers, and decision makers can enhance information security in both the government and commercial sectors.</r2:Description>

Constantly changing specifications for DoD platforms combined with recent manufacturing advances, such as 3D printing and manufacture on demand, drive a need for greater efficiency in development and design cycles as well as scalable and reconfigurable manufacturing processes that incorporate advanced materials with superior properties.  Research within the Materials Processing and Manufacturing thrust is focused on achieving the following capability objectives:  (1) scalable processes to assemble fully 3D devices that include nanometer- to micron-scale components; (2) processes that yield new materials, materials capabilities and parts that cannot be made through conventional processing approaches; (3) efficient, low volume manufacturing; (4) approaches that reduce manufacturing complexity through new material feedstock formats with reconfigurable processing techniques; and (5) material processing that enhances platform survivability in extreme environments.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Functional Materials and Devices thrust is developing advanced materials, components and systems to improve device performance for DoD sensing, imaging and communication applications.  One focus of this thrust involves development of advanced transductional materials that convert one form of energy to another for DoD-relevant applications in areas such as thermoelectrics.  While promising transduction materials are known for a variety of applications, integration into devices has not been realized.  Another focus area is the development of physics based models that predict material behavior when illuminated by high peak power electromagnetic interference.  A third focus area involves development of new multi-functional materials and device designs that will radically decrease the size, weight and power requirements of neutron and gamma sources for high-resolution neutron, gamma and x-ray imaging.  Such devices should enable fieldable detection units for non-destructive evaluation of parts, detection of explosives and other DoD-relevant targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Multi-Scale Modeling thrust, an outgrowth of the Reconfigurable Systems thrust, is developing advanced, multi-physics models that can predict the effect of disturbances and/or perturbations in the space environment in order to inform operational decisions based on current space environment conditions.  Current space environment models are limited to predicting long term climatic averages or regularly occurring phenomena and do not fully account for coupling effects where perturbations in one region of the space environment may produce disturbances in another region.  Approaches for addressing these limitations under the Multi-Scale Modeling thrust include the following:  (1) development of observation driven/first-principles theory of magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling; (2) creation of an extensible assimilation framework for unifying space environment monitoring systems and data; and (3) non-traditional space environment measurement approaches.  These developments will ensure the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of space weather models and is sufficient to enable prediction of operationally relevant perturbations and disturbances in the space environment.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The DoD needs tools to rapidly and effectively train military personnel in multifaceted and complex tasks.  The Enhancing Neuroplasticity program is exploring and developing peripheral nerve stimulation methods and non-invasive devices to promote synaptic plasticity for improved learning paradigms.  Key advances anticipated from this research will both create an anatomical and functional map of the underlying biological circuitry that mediates plasticity and optimize stimulation and training protocols to enable long-term retention for military personnel.  Once successfully identified, the underlying mechanisms of targeted plasticity training can be applied to a broad range of cognitive skill training within the DoD, including foreign language learning, or data and intelligence analysis.</r2:Description>

The Preemptive Expression of Protective Alleles (PREPARE) program is creating a transient, near immediate prophylaxis to protect military personnel and civilians against public health and national security threats.  Currently, protection against chemical, biological, and radiological threats relies on physical barrier technology.  This program will include research to develop novel transient and reversible gene modulator therapies to bolster intrinsic host defenses.

This program will develop new technologies to control and manipulate the microbiome to enable peak human performance. Current state-of-the-art approaches are focused on metagenomics to inventory and categorize the microbes in a given sample. In order to have more precise and on-demand control of the human microbiome, technologies will be developed to elucidate the complex interactions between the microorganisms and their human host as well as the interactions between consortia of adapted and evolved microorganisms. Additional work will be performed to facilitate human functions (e.g., immunity to disease, metabolic performance, tolerance to chemical exposure, etc.) and behaviors (e.g., mood, decision making, ability to work as a cohesive team, etc.) using specific microbial consortia living in the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, skin or mouth. Advances in this area will both develop novel technologies to interrogate complex microbial communities in human systems and discover ways to beneficially harness microbiomes to expand warfighter resiliency and performance.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.

Research thrusts focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Success is predicated on tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (those tolerant of harsh environments).

This program will aid the warfighter by improving immune response, minimizing inflammation, and restoring critical organ function post trauma.  One approach to achieve this capability will require the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to harness the bioelectric code, enabling targeted therapy without the need for pharmacological products, ultimately reducing logistical requirements.  An additional approach involves characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, which provides a quantitative framework to guide therapy.  Algorithms will be developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions for military personnel.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will improve the response capabilities against severe biological threats and offer new avenues for treating disease or organ function to improve force readiness.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project therefore supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards.

The Electronic Technology project will also investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful devices, including non-silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low-cost, reliable, fast, and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.  Rapid design and utilization of these new technologies will be a critical focus of ELT-01, as DoD looks for mechanisms to speed the development and fielding of advanced technologies.

This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.

The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. These limits present a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include materials, architectures, and designs intended to suit a specific need. In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact Radio Frequency (RF) signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.  Opportunities for transferring HAVOC technology to the Services will be identified during the execution of the early phases of the program.  Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Wafer-scale Infrared Detectors (WIRED)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands.  These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program aims to greatly improve the cost, size, weight, and performance of free-space optical systems.  These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging.  Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.  These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program aims to develop extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations.  Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare (EW); and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).  The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions at lower performance.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur.  These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields.  In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and Ultralow Frequency (ULF) communications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program aims to develop intrinsically linear (ideal) radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range.  Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs.  The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power.</r2:Description>

The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra-broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and vulnerable to interference and jamming. WISPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, electronic warfare (EW) communications deception, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of future C4ISR missions. The program develops an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and featureless waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link.  The WiSPER program moved from ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The SHort Range Independent Microrobotic Platforms (SHRIMP) program will develop and demonstrate multi-functional millimeter-to-centimeter scale robotic platforms with a focus on untethered mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity.  To achieve this goal, SHRIMP will also provide foundational research in the area of micro-actuator materials and energy efficient power systems for extremely size, weight, and power (SWaP)-constrained microrobotic systems.  The program's platform development activities will leverage recent advances in low power, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) electronics and low power sensors from the internet of things (IoT) community to increase the functionality of microrobotic platforms while increasing platform mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity. The microrobotic platform capabilities enabled by SHRIMP will provide the DoD with significantly more access and capability to operate in small spaces that are practically inaccessible to today's state-of-the-art robotic platforms.  Such capability will have impact in search and rescue, disaster relief, infrastructure inspection, and equipment maintenance, among other operations.

                                <r2:Description>The Intelligent Spectroscopic &amp; Temporal Fusion (INSPECT) program will add relevant spectral content to broadband infrared (IR) imagers to enhance battlefield detection and discrimination while maintaining situational awareness.  The resulting desired capability is analogous to human vision that relies upon shape, brightness, and color to recognize and identify objects of interest.  Currently fielded systems are either broadband infrared sensors that rely on shape and brightness to identify targets or hyperspectral sensors that rely on color to identify targets.  INSPECT will (1) leverage read-out integrated circuits currently in development combined with advances in electrically tunable optical filters and micro-optical components to demonstrate hardware that simultaneously provides situational awareness and target spectral characteristics, and (2) develop intelligent processing for mission-specific band selection.  This will enable new applications in passive seeker technology for missiles, battlefield chemical sensing, laser weapon identification and protection, and low probability of detection multi-spectral optical communications.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Instinctual RF program will develop radio frequency (RF) front-end technology that can protect wideband digital radios against external electromagnetic threats and self-interference, through tunable filtering, limiting, or signal cancellation. Today's multi-function phased arrays that cover broad bandwidth are open to all frequencies with little or no RF filtering.  This is due to a lack of reconfigurable filtering that is small enough to integrate into the arrays,  limiting the use of wideband multi-function arrays in contested environments.  The ability to create reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important to implementing transmit/receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays.  Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference.  Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to listen while jamming.  Instinctual RF will develop the signal cancellation devices that will listen to the transmit signal and subtract the interfering signal from the input of the receiver so that it will be able to hear faint signals near the noise floor.  Instinctual RF research will provide feedback mechanisms that instinctively correct these problems, much like the nerves of the human body serve to trigger protective action without conscious thought. Whether for self-induced interference or external interference jamming, this program will show the ability to auto-correct and allow for continued operation.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program will integrate diverse electronic and photonic components to create a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer for various mission-critical DoD applications.  Frequency synthesis and accurate control of radiofrequency and microwave radiation is the enabling technology for radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, positioning and navigation technology, and many other core DoD capabilities.  Frequency synthesis and control of light or optical waves, however, has been constrained to laboratory experiments due to the size, fragility, and cost of optical frequency synthesizers.  DODOS will leverage recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.  The program could lead to disruptive DoD capabilities, including high-bandwidth optical communications, higher performance Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), portable high-accuracy atomic clocks, and high-resolution detection of chemical/biological threats at a distance.

The program aims to realize modular Integrated Circuits (ICs) that integrate designs using different commercial suppliers and silicon technologies.  CHIPS will therefore pursue standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.

                                <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  The N-ZERO program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics.  CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  These capabilities can help to ensure that the DoD has multiple potential suppliers for critical ICs and help keep military electronics at the leading edge.  The CRAFT program moves to Project ELT-02, Beyond Scaling Technologies, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will demonstrate the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.

The Beyond Scaling - Design will develop and demonstrate the tools required for rapidly designing and deploying specialized circuits. As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics cost, speed, and power derived from silicon scaling, the DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies by using design tools that enable circuit specialization.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. These limits present a barrier that must be overcome in order for progress to continue. This project will therefore pursue potential electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead leverage circuit specialization, to include materials, architectures, and designs intended to suit a specific need. In addition, the Beyond Scaling Technology Project recognizes that the envisioned electronics specialization will require proper security safeguards. Electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies. Programs within the Beyond Scaling project will look at reducing barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs will also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and explore techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware. This project aggregates and continues Beyond Scaling programs that were initiated in PEs/Projects 0602716E/ELT-01 and 0602303E/IT-02 and IT-03.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will demonstrate the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas will include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  The program aims to demonstrate the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.

                                <r2:Description>The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies.  Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH will drive new research in electronics hardware security and exploit current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program will also investigate flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH will seek to mitigate the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.  The SSITH program moved from Project IT-03, Information Assurance and Survivability, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program will pursue new hardware architectures and algorithms for improving the efficiency of graph and sparse data analytics.  When developing operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today are forced to reduce the scope of the problems that they can address and the tempo of their analyses due to the limitations of currently deployed hardware.  Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE seeks to leverage improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program will investigate advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  Program success would therefore enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time.  The HIVE program moved from Project IT-02, High Productivity, High Performance Responsive Architectures, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Digital RF Battlespace Emulator (DRBE)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Digital RF Battlespace Emulator (DRBE) program aims to develop a large-scale, interactive, emulated radiofrequency (RF) environment, providing the DoD with much needed capability to cost-effectively evaluate adaptive, intelligent, and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems.  Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems.  Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap.  Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data.  To overcome these limitations, DRBE will leverage advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems.  The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands.  DRBE will pursue three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling.  The resulting test environment should allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test.  Multi-system exercises could then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE should therefore serve to develop CONOPS, inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Circuit Realization At Faster Timescales (CRAFT) program will develop novel integrated circuit (IC) design flows to reduce by ten times the design and verification effort required for high-performance military electronics.  CRAFT will also reduce barriers to the design and fabrication of custom ICs in leading-edge complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. When selecting electronics for advanced systems, DoD currently must choose between high-performing custom ICs that take years to design and verify or significantly lower-performing general purpose ICs that can be implemented in a few months.  The need to protect sensitive IC information further limits DoD's ability to access certain leading-edge commercial electronics.  To reduce the design and verification effort, CRAFT will investigate and leverage novel design flows that utilize recent advances in electronic design automation and software design methodologies.  These design flows could reduce the manual labor required to develop and verify custom ICs.  CRAFT will also explore increased design reuse and flexibility, which will allow DoD to migrate chip fabrication between different foundries or to more advanced technology nodes.  The CRAFT program moved from Project ELT-01, Electronic Technology, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to extend the lifetimes of remotely-deployed sensors from months to years.  Today's state-of-the-art sensors can be pre-placed and remain dormant until awoken by an external trigger or stimulus.  However, the active electronics that monitor for external triggers consume power, limiting sensor lifetimes to between weeks and months.  N-ZERO seeks to replace these electronics with passive or extremely low-power devices that continuously monitor the environment and wake up active electronics upon detection of a specific trigger.  This would eliminate or significantly reduce standby power consumption, ensuring that sensor lifetimes are limited only by the power required to process and communicate confirmed events.  In doing so, N-ZERO could enable wireless sensors with drastically increased mission life and help meet DoD's unfulfilled need for a persistent, event-driven sensing capability.  N-ZERO's applied research component will focus on developing radio frequency (RF) communications and physical sensor systems that use energy from an external trigger to collect, process, and detect useful information while rejecting spurious signals and noise.  A basic research component is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.  The N-ZERO program moved from Project ELT-01, Electronics Technology, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

Rapid prototyping and experimentation of integrated system concepts, as well as enabling vehicle subsystems will be conducted.  Programs will explore new architectural concepts that employ a mix of weapon technologies that achieve lethality through a combination of overwhelming performance and overwhelming numbers rather than through the use of singular and costly high value assets.  Studies conducted under this program element include examination and evaluation of emerging aerospace threats, technologies, concepts, use of autonomy to minimize risk, and applications for missiles, munitions, and vehicle systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

AFRE will demonstrate turbine to Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ) transition of a Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system utilizing an off-the-shelf turbine engine.  Large scale components of this complex propulsion system will be developed and demonstrated independently, followed by a full-scale freejet TBCC propulsion system mode transition ground test.  Accomplishing these objectives will enable future hypersonic systems resulting in transformational changes in long range strike, high speed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) operations.

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Operational Fires (OpFires) program is to develop and demonstrate a novel ground-launched system enabling advanced tactical weapons to penetrate modern enemy air defenses and rapidly and precisely engage critical time sensitive targets.  This program seeks to develop an advanced booster capable of delivering a variety of payloads at a variety of ranges.  Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonics to achieve these objectives.  The transition partner is the Army.  In FY18, this program was funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-04.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Air-Ground Autonomous VEhicles (AGAVE) program will explore the seams between air and ground vehicles.  New approaches are required to address one of the most symmetric of all warfighting domains-ground combat.  The program will seek to provide improved mobility solutions for supporting combat operations that place unmanned assets forward to explore and inform troops prior to entering an area, or to provide continued perimeter and overhead surveillance during operations.  Technologies will be explored to allow increased levels of autonomy, improved operating ranges, improved mobility through complex 3-dimensional battlespaces, and integration of the requirements for both ground and air mobility in complex urban warfare settings.  Reduced manning requirements will be a part of the design space evaluation, with unmanned vehicles operating in a supporting role instead of a traditional supported role.  Novel approaches to launch and recovery that reduce the need for highly trained personnel dedicated to monitoring unmanned vehicles will be explored.  Problems that cross all domains, such as high energy density power supplies, navigation through uncertain and changing environments, and supervisory autonomy of vehicles will be addressed.  Novel networking approaches will also be explored to close the seams between ground and air unmanned vehicles and to improve confidence in identifying risks associated with both natural hazards and enemy actions prior to ground personnel entering an area.  Cueing from other assets and long range, long duration autonomous assets will be included in the overall tradespace explored.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) program is to enhance mission performance, reduce cost, confound adversaries, and reduce reliance on space assets for navigation and communication by distributing mission functions such as sensing, communication, precision navigation, kinetic, and non-kinetic effects to small platforms and increasing their level of autonomy.  Collaboration of multiple assets offers new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort will specifically focus on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets through autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.  Potential transition partners include the Air Force, Army, and Navy.</r2:Description>

The program developed the technology for launch and recovery of large unmanned aircraft capable of providing persistent 24/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  TERN enabled novel operational concepts including maritime surveillance and responsive, persistent deep overland ISR and strike, without requirement for forward basing.  Application of TERN technologies and operational concepts enabled a novel and cost efficient approach for multiple mission sets.  DARPA transitioned the TERN program to the Office of Naval Research for continued development in Q4 FY 2018.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced/maintained.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems.  Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Experimental Spaceplane One (XSP) program is to develop and flight demonstrate a prototype booster and expendable upper stage with responsive aircraft-like operations.  Past efforts have identified and demonstrated critical enabling technologies including composite or lightweight structures, propellant tanks, thermal protection systems, rocket propulsion and advanced avionics/software.  A critically important technology gap is integration into a flight demonstration able to deliver aircraft-like operability.  The program will validate key technologies on the ground, and then fabricate an X-Plane to demonstrate: 1) 10 booster flights in 10 days, 2) design the objective system for >3000-lb payload at a reduced cost, 3) fly the demonstration system one time with an orbital payload of 900-lbs, and 4) fly to a high staging speed (Mach 3-10).  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force, Navy and commercial sector.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), providing persistence and enabling ground station antennas to point in a fixed direction.  Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to provide robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.  To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>*Previously Responsive Access for Space Resilience

Advances in technology, including networking and computing, have significantly increased the utility of small (&lt;300kg) spacecraft that would previously have been of limited military value. For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today. The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure. This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today. Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs. The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure. To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site. The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers. The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA.</r2:Description>

Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) self-contained laser weapon systems to protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) component programs that integrate mixed signal (analog and digital) or mixed semiconductor technology to substantially improve the capability of existing components and/or reduce their size, weight and power.  Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements.

The Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Additionally, funding under this project will include establishing access to commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) and state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program aims to develop inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors (AIMS) that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC.  Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs should enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program seeks to build an immersive electromagnetic environment for use by the warfighter to understand the effects of electronic maneuvers and to develop new electronic maneuver warfare (EMW) techniques. In order to accomplish this, the program will leverage recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for EMW techniques. Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmed RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the Services through a series of demonstrations proving a radically shorter time scale of development.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Both the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and the atomic physics communities have done foundational research on new capabilities that will impact the ability to keep and transfer precision timing and navigation information across the battlefield. The Advanced PNT Capability Demonstrations (APCD) program will choose among the most promising of the new physics developments and demo their potential in realistic warfighting scenarios. One scenario will leverage advances in inertial sensors to enable Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-only operation over mission timeframes of twenty minutes.  The MEMS-based demo will enable munitions navigation in a GPS-denied world, maintaining U.S. munition and missile capability to accurately navigate in future battlespace environments.  Another scenario is the storing of time and position information with high performance yet compact, low power atomic physics.  This will enable advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities for example in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation, or an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) from which the atomic based information can be distributed.  Technologies developed under the APCD program are planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Efficient Ultra-Compact Laser-Integrated Diodes (EUCLID) program aims to significantly reduce the size of laser diode pump modules (DPMs) while increasing their electrical-to-optical efficiency.  DPMs are a critical component of fiber-laser array weapons systems, which combine light from many lower-power lasers to engage targets at tactically-relevant distances.  Commercial DPMs, which cater to the laser manufacturing industry, feature large cooling systems and are too cumbersome for integration into many small DoD platforms.  EUCLID plans to leverage advances in thermal management components to design, build, test, and demonstrate densely packageable, prototype DPMs that are less than half the size of their commercial counterparts.  The program will also pursue improved optical components that can more efficiently focus light from individual laser diodes.  The resulting EUCLID DPMs are intended to be available for procurement and integration into ultra-low size, weight, and power fiber-laser array weapons systems, enabling integration into a variety of Air Force, Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency platforms.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program will develop a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming.  Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.   The MIDAS program moves to Project MT-16, Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies, in FY 2019.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. In some cases, the inability to place orders in volume has created a lack of access to advanced technology nodes entirely. To address this, the DoD must participate in more industry partnerships that not only leverage investments in the commercial industry but also provide access to SOTA facilities in the U.S. This program will build on existing relationships and forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing access to commercial SOTA and SOTP foundries for DoD microelectronics fabrication runs, developing a manufacturable photonics and wide bandgap process, creating a microelectromechanical systems multi-project wafer flow, and establishing an application center to capture DoD microelectronics requirements.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Command, Control and Communications Systems Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because its purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced information systems research and development concepts.

The success of military operations depends on timely, reliable, secure, and synchronized dissemination of command and control and relevant situational awareness information to every military echelon. While wired communications and networks are fairly well developed, providing assured high-bandwidth mobile wireless capabilities that match or exceed commercial wired infrastructure is needed to meet the demands of military users. The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces. Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas:
- High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability.
- Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, scalability, and composable systems to enable adaptive effects webs.
- Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments.
- Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The goal of the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program is to develop innovative networking and information sharing approaches that enable U.S. and coalition forces to coordinate tactical operations effectively, efficiently, and securely by eliminating today's prohibitive security cost and complexity barriers.  SHARE will provide the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge.  Building upon the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program, which is budgeted in this PE/Project, and research into the use of commercial systems and infrastructure to support military operations, SHARE provides new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield.  Coordination includes providing all the information required to enable the command and control necessary to plan and execute operations in all phases of warfare.  Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies that work with coalition partners.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters and features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program will develop technology to access and analyze global-scale, multimodal geospatial data and pilot an analytics-as-a-service business model.  Exploiting multiple sources and modalities at a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services, including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums.  GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains, building upon the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) coalition warfighter information sharing program, also budgeted in this PE/Project.  By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities.  It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby will improve speed, agility, and scalability.  Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link.  This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades.  In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established.  During these network outages, data transmission is not possible.  Building on technologies explored in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also in this PE/Project, the Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments.  Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.  The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links.  The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons.  These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command.  The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries.  This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.  The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation.  PFC builds on technology developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) program, also budgeted in this PE/Project.  PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).  The PFC program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Today the operational configure time required to make systems share information in battle, even when using networks designed to interoperate,  is on the magnitude of weeks to months, but effective joint multi-domain battle integration time is needed in minutes or faster.  Technology advances are making it possible to pass messages across heterogeneous waveforms and networks, but there are no technologies today that can determine if it is the right data most important to end users and systems.  Building upon technologies developed in the Dynamic Network Adaption for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), IBM2 will combine network management with information exploitation and fusion technology to route information in an understandable context, based upon information need and value.  IBM2 also seeks to address multi-level security configuration issues that often add delays and limit interoperability.

The battle network must be able to access latent capability provided by existing systems to build and close a wide range of effects chains.

The Decomp/Recomp program will develop technology to enable efficient software modification to enable the integration or adaptation of electronic military systems to create new capability rapidly.   Using techniques developing in the commercial software community and building on insights developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE0603766E/Project NET-01);  technology developed under the Decomp/Recomp program will decompose existing programmable military electronic system software into building blocks that can be rapidly reassembled into new, interoperable functions.

                                <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield is driving a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program is to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that will meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking capacity needs of deployed military forces.  A millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency but presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program seeks to develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system.

                                <r2:Description>The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems.  The program will leverage technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy, Army, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Communication in Contested Environments (C2E)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Communication in Contested Environments (C2E) program sought to address communications problems anticipated in networked airborne systems in the mid-21st century. Expected growth in sensor systems, unmanned systems, and internetworked weapons systems strained the size of networks that current communications technology could support in the contested environment.  As adversary capabilities advanced, the DoD needed new techniques to quickly and efficiently accommodate better networking and improved communications capabilities, specifically communications systems with higher capacity, lower latency, greater jamming resistance, and reduced detectability.  As part of Advanced Networking technologies efforts, the C2E program addressed these needs with a three-pronged approach: first, it developed heterogeneous networking capabilities and advanced communication technology for airborne systems.  Low Probability of Detection (LPD), Anti-Jam (AJ), low latency, and high capacity communication protocols were developed.  Second, the program created a government controlled and maintained reference architecture for communications systems that drew from commercial communication architectures.  The defense contractor community built specific communications systems based upon this reference architecture.  Finally, C2E created a government controlled development environment to allow for rapid refresh of communications technology and allowed third party native application and waveform developers to contribute their own communications technologies.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  

The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments.  Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.

                                <r2:Description>Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Systems of Systems (PROTEUS) program will demonstrate that a dynamically composable Mosaic warfare approach provides superior performance and adaptability in the dynamic, uncertain environment imposed on U.S. warfighters by urban combat operations.  PROTEUS will provide the tools and automation to enable small tactical units to compose force packages optimized to specific urban combat objectives and challenges.  These tools will support planning and force composition for all missions relevant to the urban environment: command &amp; control, fires, maneuver, logistics, intelligence, force protection, and medical.  PROTEUS will be adaptive to an inherently dynamic and fluid environment that will account for the environmental influence of non-combatants in urban combat as well as kinetic warfighting.  Technologies will be integrated using systems of systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project.  To support concept development, testing, and warfighter interaction, the program will also develop a supporting virtual testbed.

SESU-developed capabilities will provide the small unit with improved awareness of enemy force composition, disposition, and intent.  It will also provide the means to deter escalation of threat, and, if deterrence fails, the ability to degrade, disrupt, and/or destroy enemy anti-access / area denial and combat systems.  Technologies to accomplish this include command &amp; control (C2) that operates in a contested environment; distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources; hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities; and autonomous systems to deliver effects and conduct sensing.

                                <r2:Description>As the Services develop new Joint Multi-Domain Battle warfighting concepts, there is a strong demand for innovative ways to perform experimentation in order to assess architectures, advance technology, and support operators developing advanced multi-domain tactics. Current infrastructure and technology do not support experimentation with distributed heterogeneous systems.  Based upon technologies developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the Air Combat Evolution (ACE)  program will apply technologies and principles of interoperability, autonomy, and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop an experimentation infrastructure that will allow for the integration of various modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), sub-scale, and ultimately full-scale vehicles in dynamic aerial combat environment.  The program will deliver an initial instantiation of a scalable experimentation engine capable of aircraft control at levels ranging from an advanced tactical autopilot to a form of multi-domain mosaic controller.  Experiments will explore both augmentation of existing manned platforms and increased capabilities and intelligence of future unmanned systems.  ACE will provide an early opportunity to experiment with adaptive human-machine teaming to deliver tools and architectures as the Joint Multi-Domain Battle concept evolves within the Services.  Higher-fidelity simulated adversary human behavior will also be developed to ensure blue operators conducting experiments are faced with more realistic dilemmas posed by computer-played adversaries.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Worldwide advancements in signal processing and electronics have decreased the effectiveness of single-platform, power-based Electronic Warfare (EW) as a viable technique in the future.  The goal of the Retrodirective Arrays for Coherent Transmission (ReACT) program was to develop and demonstrate the capability to combine distributed mobile transmitters to direct high-power spatially resolved radio frequency (RF) beams to a single location.  ReACT provides this capability by synchronizing multiple distributed transmitters to form a much larger effective array than a single aperture.  The key technical challenge was to synchronize distributed and moving transmitters while compensating for platform motion and vibration.  The ReACT system sensed the target's emissions and then optimally configured the ReACT transmitters to focus on the area of interest.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Air Force and Navy.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships, and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them, and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program seeks to identify and implement architectures consisting of novel combinations of manned and unmanned systems to execute long-range kill chains and develop a robust "kill web" against submarines and ships over large contested maritime areas.  By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability.  The CDMaST program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.  Through experimentation, the program will not only demonstrate integrated system performance, but also develop new tactics that capitalize on features created by the heterogeneous architecture.  The CDMaST program will invest in technologies that will reduce cost, manage complexity, and improve reliability.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

These platforms will leverage satellite communications to populate a large data repository with sensor outputs for shared processing. Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment. The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things (IoT) architecture deployed across the world's oceans. Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of  communication rate and edge processing. The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide persistent coverage to areas between existing platforms. Technologies developed in Ocean of Things will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

The Heterogeneous UnderWater Communications (HUWC) program will create an undersea internet that will span the ocean and bridge to other operating domains. Building upon technologies learned in the Tactical Underwater Network Architecture program, budgeted in this PE/Project, HUWC will provide an adaptive, heterogeneous, highly-connected network capability to link undersea and cross-domain assets together into kill webs and will establish and maintain these networks with minimal operator burden.  The program will leverage recent technological developments demonstrating short-range and long-range acoustic communications at higher bandwidth and greater reliability, while minimizing detectability.  The program will also leverage recent developments in network interoperability to manage heterogeneous undersea and cross-domain networks.

This network of platforms will project power and provide sea control across the spectrum of conflict, presenting potential adversaries with a dramatically different and rapidly reconfigurable order of battle.  Maritime Missileer is envisioned as a family of heterogeneous systems, incorporating advanced autonomy and artificial intelligence to permit stand-in operations in even the mostly heavily contested environments.  Effects are delivered with novel approaches to achieving mobility, potentially leveraging innovations in commercial shipbuilding and logistics, and platforms may vary from unmanned, to optionally manned, to manned. Technologies to be developed include advanced propulsion, energy sources for long-term operations, autonomous re-arming and re-fueling, self-maintenance, high-reliability communications, as well as hardware and software approaches to enhance system reliability, adaptability, and autonomous self-defense/anti-tamper.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations.  Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention.  This program also has a companion applied research effort budgeted in PE0602702E, Project TT-03.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) program seeks to counter the fourth-generation submarine signature quieting technology that has significantly degraded passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) sonar detection range and targeting performance.  The MOCCA program will nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems.  The off-board UUV sonar projector will operate under positive control at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program seeks to achieve breakthrough capability for long-range submarine detection and precision target tracking.  The program will develop compact, high-output acoustic transducers and novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling.  In addition, the MOCCA system will be integrated into submarine onboard sonar and weapons control systems.  Technologies from this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment.  This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program will overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.  The program will develop and demonstrate novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program will focus on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program will emphasize early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program will provide the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment.  The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors will have a transformative impact on a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning.  For all of these applications, sensor gain is currently achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays.  The TEAC program will create the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively to focus energy undersea.  This provides an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles and new acoustic source technologies.  Technologies developed under this program are intended to transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Undersea platforms have inherent operational and tactical advantages such as stealth and surprise.  Platform drag due to fluid viscosity and platform powering requirements varies with the speed through the water.  Platform energy and power density limitations create two distinct operational usage profiles: one for unmanned undersea vehicles (low speed, long endurance) and another for undersea weapons (high speed, short endurance).  Designers have historically solved this with hybrid systems such as the Navy's Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket, or by increasing the size of undersea systems.  However, hybrid systems can be vulnerable to air and undersea defensive systems and larger undersea systems can result in significant launch platform modifications.  The Blue Wolf program provided a radically different solution to develop and demonstrate an undersea demonstrator vehicle with endurance and speed capabilities beyond conventional undersea systems within the weight and volume envelopes of current Navy undersea systems.  Significant technical challenges addressed included, dynamic lift and drag reduction, hybrid energy system development compatible with existing manned platform safety requirements and certification, and system integration and demonstration in at-sea environment.  The program leveraged Navy connectivity, autonomy, guidance, navigation, and obstacle avoidance technologies. Under an existing Memorandum of Agreement, following vehicle integration and initial testing, the program is transitioning to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Hybrid Multi Material Rotor Full Scale Demonstration (HyDem) program applied breakthroughs in materials and material system technologies, and multi-disciplinary design methods to a Virginia Class submarine propulsor, a critical component in submarine performance.  This new propulsor enabled the Navy to operate its submarine fleet with improved capability, allowing for the creation of strategic surprise.  Submarines can exploit expanded areas previously unattainable for the purpose of submarine warfare, including antisubmarine warfare (ASW), antisurface warfare (ASuW), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) gathering, strike, Special Forces operations, and strategic deterrence missions.  The Navy has evaluated this component in sea trials.  It is envisioned that the Navy will integrate this design change into the future development of the Virginia Class and Columbia Class submarines, and could back-fit previously constructed Virginia Class submarines.  Technology developed under this program has transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets.  Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects.  Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows an Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas.  Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The proliferation of Radio Frequency (RF)-based countermeasures, such as Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM), has presented challenges to the effectiveness of data sensors.  The Multi-Optical Sensing (MOS) program enabled an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter-class and long-range strike aircraft.  This program leveraged emerging high-sensitivity Focal Plane Array (FPA) and compact, multi-band laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-optical sensing system.  Technical challenges included the demonstration of inexpensive, multi-band, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The MOS program advanced the state of the art of components and technology to support an all-optical airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.  Technologies from this program transitioned to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

SECTR-developed systems and technologies will be small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, and be applicable to a wide range of weapons and missions, such as small unit lethality, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and strike of time-sensitive targets.  Hardware technology will leverage passive Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture.  SECTR will also develop a Government-owned open architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software).  The technical approach to target recognition will start from "deep learning" and machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features.

                                <r2:Description>The Small Satellite Sensors program will develop and space-qualify Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) sensor and inter-satellite communications technologies and establish feasibility for new DoD tactical capabilities to be implemented on small (&lt; 100 kg) satellites.  Experimental payloads will be flown on small satellites, and data will be collected to validate new operational concepts.  Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations, which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.  The program will focus on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications.

                                <r2:Description>Dominance of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations.  Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time-consuming to build and integrate onto platforms.  The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems.  This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a System and Sensor Resource Manager (SSRM)).  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.  Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Building on technologies explored under the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program, also budgeted in this PE/Project, the objective of ASTRAL is to provide a factor of at least 1000 times improvement over current signal awareness processing speed over broad spectral coverage.  The program will use technology that supports a development path leading to a mobile, tactical capability.  The development objectives of the ASTRAL program are to (1) develop a hybrid processor that provides real-time processing of the most challenging Low-Probability-of-Intercept (LPI) threat signals across a wide bandwidth, and (2) identify exploitation algorithms for military applications that are well-suited to this type of hybrid processor.  Several strategic and tactical spectrum awareness applications that may be addressed include but are not limited to (a) real-time exploitation of optical communications, (b) city-wide wireless device geo-location, (c) broadband LPI radar warning, and (d) theater-wide spread-spectrum LPI radio geo-location.

                                <r2:Description>*formerly Cognitive Maneuver

The Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS) program will build decision aids for gray zone scenarios, where adversaries attempt to manipulate a U.S.-allied nation through the use of both kinetic and non-kinetic means.  Based on research performed under the Resilient Synchronized Planning &amp; Assessment Contested Environment (RSPACE) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01, the purpose of the COMPASS program is to reduce ambiguity and reveal intent of gray zone actors who use techniques such as misinformation and intimidation to destabilize host nations and possibly produce advantageous conditions for military engagements. The tools produced by COMPASS will automate gray zone information operations and help U.S. forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and demonstrate tools to 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments.  COMPASS will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains.  Building upon technologies from the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, this program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors.  The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g. class-I or II unmanned aerial system).  The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains with possibly different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  Current ATRs are typically designed for specific sensors and provide only limited, static mission support due to pre-programmed target lists and operating modes.  Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets can be costly and time-consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program is to develop technologies that reduce operational limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life-cycle maintenance costs.  Recent breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms and embedded computing systems offer promise for dramatic improvements in ATR utility.  The program will focus on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enable performance-driven sensing and ATR utility; (2) algorithm training technology that enables rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduce required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software demands of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program is planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms, such as the AC-130J aircraft, in support of ground forces.  Under clear conditions, targets are easily identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments, the atmosphere can inhibit traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, negating optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that prevent circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program developed a real-time spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging sensor that provides imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program transitioned to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Adaptive Radar Countermeasures (ARC) program developed new algorithms for rapidly protecting DoD systems against new or unknown radar-based threats.  Protecting these systems currently relies on uniquely identifying an enemy radar and applying an appropriate, pre-programmed Electronic Countermeasure (ECM), which can take years to develop.  The emergence of digitally-programmed radars that exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics, however, has made this approach to countering radar-based threats increasingly challenging.  Developing new ECM over several years is no longer sufficient.  ARC developed new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  The program transitioned to Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps airborne electronic warfare systems.</r2:Description>

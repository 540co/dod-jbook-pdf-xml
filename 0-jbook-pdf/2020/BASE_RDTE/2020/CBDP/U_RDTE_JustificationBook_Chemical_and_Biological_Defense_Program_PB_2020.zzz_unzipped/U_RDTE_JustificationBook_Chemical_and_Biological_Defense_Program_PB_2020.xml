                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project NT2 provides early applied research to enhance and develop defensive capabilities against Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs). This project focuses on expanding scientific knowledge required to develop defensive capabilities and to demonstrate fast and agile scientific responses to enhance or develop capabilities that address emerging threats.
 
Efforts and studies conducted under this project address direction from the FDA to conduct specific post-New Drug Application (NDA)-approval efforts and studies (e.g. required studies, Post Marketing Commitments), and requirements from the joint service users. This project is a comprehensive and focused effort for developing Non-Traditional Agents (NTA) defense capabilities, coordinated with specific interagency partners for doctrine, equipment, and training for the Warfighter and civilian population for defense against NTAs.

Individual efforts in this project include:
- Support an integrated approach to counter emerging threats through innovative science and technology (S&amp;T) solutions for detection, protection, decontamination, information systems and modeling and simulation, and medical countermeasures. 
- Provides for the upgrade and modernization of Medical Chemical  Defense countermeasures which include U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prophylactics, pre-treatments, and therapeutics and intend to protect and/or sustain the Joint Service Member in a toxic chemical threat environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this program element (PE) demonstrate technologies supporting transition to advanced component development for physical capabilities which cover biological and chemical detection, situational awareness and effects modeling, and protection and hazard mitigation.  Other major efforts support enhanced chemical detection capabilities for aerosols and non-traditional agents, expanded capabilities for early warning in pathogen detection and diagnosis, and pretreatments and therapeutics against a broader set of chemical and biological agents.  Medical capabilities (pretreatments, therapeutics, diagnostics capabilities, and drug manufacturing and regulatory science technologies), include capabilities against non-traditional agents.

Individual projects include:
- Chemical Biological Defense (CB3): demonstrations of CB physical science defense technologies, including biological detection, chemical detection, digital battlespace management, and protection, and decontamination. The Project continues to pursue solutions against traditional agents.

- NTA Defense (NT3): dedicated research (both medical and non-medical) is consolidated in NT3. This effort includes NTA chemical diagnostics, medical pretreatments, therapeutics, detection, and protection and hazard mitigation.

- Medical Defense (TM3): aims to produce biological diagnostic assays and reagents, diagnostic device platforms, pretreatments and therapeutics for bacterial, viral, and toxin threats as well as for chemical threats, and medical devices, as countermeasures for CBR threat agents. Specific areas of medical investigation include: prophylaxis, pretreatment, antidotes and therapeutics, personnel and patient decontamination, and medical management of casualties.

- Technology Transition (TT3): pursues federal R&amp;D or commercially available products to enhance military operational capability, concepts of operation, WMD elimination, and hazard mitigation following a biological warfare or chemical warfare attack.

The CBDP S&amp;T Advanced Technology Development stakeholders: United States Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), United States Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, Naval Research Lab (NRL), Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), among others. The intent is to maintain strategic partnerships with the DoD Service communities for mission success across the enterprise through collaborative planning and programming maintaining budget assurance.

This PE is dedicated to conducting proof-of-principle field demonstrations, and testing system-specific technologies to meet specific military needs.  Work conducted under this PE will transition to and will provide risk reduction for PE 0603884BP and PE 0604384BP activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project TT3 validates high-risk/high-payoff technologies, concepts-of-operations, and a Joint Combat Developer concept development and experimentation process that could significantly improve Warfighter capabilities in preparation for transition of mature chemical and biological (CB) defense technologies to advanced development programs.

Individual efforts in this project include:
- These programs offer the opportunity to identify and efficiently mature emerging technologies, reduce risks, and finalize engineering and integration efforts. 
- These programs seek to demonstrate the potential for enhanced military operational capability and/or cost effectiveness. Upon conclusion of the technical and operational demonstrations, the user or sponsor provides a determination of the military utility and operational impact of the technology and capability demonstrated. Successfully demonstrated technologies with proven military utility can remain in place for future extended user evaluations, accepted into the advanced stages of the formal acquisition process, proceed directly into limited or full- scale production or be returned to the technical base for further development. 
- This project addresses the four primary thrust areas of Sense, Shape, Shield, and Sustain, with an emphasis on Integrated Early Warning. Integrated Early Warning is conducted through a coordinated program approach focused on layering Chemical and Biological Detection technologies and integrating CB threat indicators to provide combination of awareness and understanding that facilitates effective (timely) decision making so the force can continue military operations and achieve mission success in a CBRN environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Contamination Avoidance Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) Project supports reconnaissance, detection, identification, and hazard prediction equipment, hardware, and software.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NCGD 4)
(2) Wearable Chemical Agent Detector (WCAD) (formerly Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) 4)
(3) Biosurveillance (BSV)
(4) CBRN Sensor Integration on Robotics Platforms (CSIRP)
(5) Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets (CBRN DRS)
(6) Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW)
(7) Enhanced Capability Demonstration Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (ECD JCACS)
(8) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense, and
(9) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA).

The WCAD (formerly known as NGCD 4) is designed to be an unobtrusive, low-profile chemical detection capability that will continuously, and autonomously, monitor and alert general and specialized units to an unsafe environment without further burdening the warfighters payload or interfering with the primary mission. The small form factor is amenable to both man-worn and unmanned aerial or unmanned ground systems operations in order to enable timely personnel protective action and other force protection decisions.  In FY20, WCAD is aligned with CSIRP to identify and develop chemical sensors for unmanned applications.

BSV programs provide a set of capabilities that acquire, integrate, and analyze medical, environmental, and incident management data using existing and next generation systems, medical and non-medical sample collection tools and identifiers/diagnostics.  BSV will address medical and physical CBRN mission needs spanned in over eleven requirements documents and through Combatant Commander (COCOM) identified needs.  BSV supports the Capabilities to Enable NBC Threat Awareness, Understanding, and Response (CENTAUR) effort, and immediate operational needs, which find, demonstrate, transition, and transfer the best operational concepts and technology solutions in support of a holistic approach to countering CB threats from the laboratory to operational use and theater confirmation of a CB Event. CENTAUR serves as the baseline configuration for ECD IEW.

CSIRP is a prototyping and fielding effort that will focus on repackaging and integrating modular CBRN sensor solutions to enhance Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) Programs of Record (PORs) to provide situational awareness across the echelons of command in order to enable freedom of maneuver and action on the battlefield.  An integrated CSIRP capability will exploit advances in machine learning and autonomy, sensing and communication capabilities that enable timely and accurate detection, warning and reporting of CBRN hazards for increased risk reduction opportunities at tactical and operational echelons in mounted and dismounted configurations.  CSIRP gives the Joint Force an opportunity to enhance capabilities and maintain operational advantage in a lethal and sophisticated operating environment.  

The CBRN DRS supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. The CBRN DRS will provide an Advanced Capabilities Set to meet emerging requirements for the follow-on technical forces to conduct more in-depth dismounted CBRN reconnaissance, sensitive site assessment, characterization of WMD/hazardous materials, events, or accidents, and sensitive site exploitation/elimination. The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Advanced Capability Set will provide more sensitive and reliable detection and identification of CBRN threats, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for longer duration missions, and increased situation awareness through networked communications of the hazard. The CBRN DRS configurations will be tailored to meet individual Service mission tasks.  The technology upgrade and refresh effort for CBRN DRS transitions from CA4 to CA7 for implementation starting in FY20.

The ECD IEW will integrate advanced technologies and currently fielded capabilities into a common architecture with situational understanding decision tools to facilitate effective (timely) decision making, so the force can continue military operations or assist partners or civilians in a Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) environment.  The Joint Force requires tactical, enhanced, and CBRN detection, protection, contamination mitigation, contamination characterization, situational awareness, and hazard understanding early warning capability and decision tools to provide operational commanders time, space, and confidence for decisions that enable mission success.  ECD IEW will demonstrate these capabilities by focusing on the complex integration of currently disconnected and disparate battlefield systems to enable a Joint Integrated Early Warning Capability for all phases of operations.

The ECD JCACS demonstrated new technologies to enhance the ability of Joint operators to locate, identify, characterize, sample, digitally report, protect against, and mitigate CBRN threats.  The ECD JCACS will integrate advanced technologies to provide capability sets of equipment and situational awareness tools to protect against and mitigate the effects of contamination during WMD interdiction and site characterization missions.  In FY20, ECD JCACS will focus on the use of robotics to enhance these missions.

NTA Defense program works with the Joint Services, interagency, and international partners to focus RDT&amp;E resources to determine readiness against Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBA).  Program provides support to the CBDP Enterprise by assessing technology and equipment to enable rapid fielding options for all users.

The ROSETTA is a modernization effort to provide a higher confidence chemical liquid hazard detection ticket in the currently fielded M256A2 kit for the Warfighter to make timely decisions.  These decisions will reduce casualties and improve the combat effectiveness of troops engaged in conflicts involving the use of chemical warfare agents. ROSETTA is based on colorimetric technology and will be eye-readable.  In addition, the ROSETTA ticket will provide improved hazard detection performance with reduced false alarm rate, potential for increased number of chemicals detected, reduced detection time especially for certain compounds of interest, and potential for integration onto unmanned platforms especially micro-sized unmanned aerial sensors.  In FY20, ROSETTA will be testing vendor prototypes to develop technical data packages.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

NGCD used Full and Open competition to award Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contracts. In FY18 NGCD 4 awarded a wearable technology assessment (WTA) contract to provide brassboard and breadboard prototypes for Government evaluation. Beginning in FY19 NGCD BA4 will be renamed WCAD.


WEARABLE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (WCAD)

WCAD will complete Technology Readiness Evaluation, Modeling &amp; Simulation, Table Top Exercises, and initiate Business Case Analysis efforts to support contractual development for a Milestone A award when program funding restarts. WCAD will continue engagement with OGA stakeholders and industry to inform documentation decisions and program decisions.

BIOSURVEILLANCE (BSV)

BSV will utilize residual capabilities from CENTAUR. With the Close out of CENTAUR at Busan Pier 8, BSV will transition and integrate successful technologies into a baseline IEW framework, to support USFK &amp; 8th Army's need for environmental monitoring and surveillance, in support of immediate force health protection requirements. Applicable technologies, will be developed, integrated, deployed, operated and sustained, through Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) and procurement contracts. Completion of the effort will serve as a baseline configuration for IEW efforts with in the CBDP, technologies, lessons learned, test data, will be transitioned to the programs of record associated with the CBDP (such as IEW ECD, EMBD, NGDS, JBTDS &amp; Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS)).

CBRN SENSOR INTEGRATION ON ROBOTIC PLATFORMS (CSIRP)

CSIRP is a streamlined acquisition effort to rapidly prototype and field capabilities distinct from the traditional acquisition system.  CSIRP will provide unmanned CBRN payloads in 2 year capability sets based on service requirements.   The 2 year capability sets will utilize a streamlined acquisition process in order to keep pace with industry and the rapid advancement of technologies.   CSIRP strategy is to utilize the rapid prototyping process enabled by the Other Transactional Agreements (OTA) contract vehicle.  

Upon award, the awardees will have up to two years to produce 10 working prototype sensors that are integrated onto service chosen (air and/or land) platforms.  These prototypes will be demonstrated, evaluated and tested by the services as well as laboratories and academia.  The most successful will be transitioned to the services for the next steps in acquisition, production and eventual fielding.

CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS

The Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets (CBRN DRS) will provide more sensitive and reliable detection and identification of CBRN threats, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) for longer duration missions, and increased situation awareness through networked communications of the hazard. The program will assess requirements and the market for future technology upgrades and refresh efforts to be transferred to and executed under CA7.


ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMO INTEGRATED EARLY WARNING (ECD IEW)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration Integrated Early Warning (ECD IEW) will conduct an analysis of alternatives and leverage the DTRA IEW ATD, JUPITR ATD, and various operational responses to procure developmental equipment and decision support tools for experimentation and demonstration to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS TTPs, Non-CBRN sensors, and requirements to provide operational commanders time and space for freedom to maneuver and action.  The ECD IEW will utilize Table Top Exercises (TTX), Operational Demonstrations, and other test events to provide cross commodity equipment sets evaluation leading to the operational deployment through rapid prototyping to a unit to be determined, further requirements development, CBDP program of record insertion, and concepts of employment.

ENHANCED CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION JOINT CBRNE ADV CAPABILITY SETS (ECD JCACS)

The Enhanced Capability Demonstration (ECD) Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Advanced Capability Sets (JCACS) evaluates various equipment during User Feedback Events (UFE) and other test events.  The acquisition strategy is to use Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs) and collaborate with CBRN Sensor Integration onto Robotic Platforms (CSIRP) to acquire the equipment and technical support required.  Additionally, JCACS and CSIRP will utilize Government Agencies and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers to provide development, testing and technical support.  ECD JCACS will work together with CSIRP to focus on the use and integration of robotics to enhance these missions.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program will transition information, technologies, and capabilities for PBAs and other emerging threats into existing and future acquisition programs (PORs, ECD/ACDs, and Accelerated Acquisition) and utilize a variety of contract mechanisms (full and open competition, existing task order contracts within DoD).

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

ROSETTA will use a streamlined approach. This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) OTA to award multiple development contracts. The M256A3 Production Contract will use Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) to purchase the new kits. The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services.The M256A3 kit will replace the M256A2 kit by attrition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations.  

Efforts included in this Project are:
(1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS)
(2) Tactical Disablement System (TACDS)
(3) Mass Personnel Decontamination (MPD).

The CHRS Program is based on capability gaps identified within both the Contamination Mitigation Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), dated March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs ICD, dated October 2008.  The program consists of two capabilities that will allow for the mitigation of chemical, biological and radiological contaminants in order to safely repatriate DOD-affiliated personnel back to the United States for final interment.  The two capabilities identified within the ConMit Initial Capabilities Document: a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely repatriate chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States and a sustainable Contaminated Remains Mitigation System (CRMS) to reduce the hazard to warfighters by decontaminating chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains.  CRMS was previously known as Contaminated Human Remains Decontamination System (CHRDS).  The CHRT is a containment system that will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards.  The CRMS is a system of tents, plumbing, generators, and medical equipment necessary to establish a decontamination site to perform decontamination, identification, and packaging of contaminated human remains for further disposition.  The CRMS will reduce the hazards associated with contaminated human remains through decontamination of remains and enable positive identification of remains for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner before packaging in a CHRT. The CRMS efforts will continue in FY19 under the MPD funding line.

The TacDS, to be developed as a Family of Systems (FoS), will provide a tactical commander a suite of products to disable (delay, disrupt, and/or degrade) or defeat (destroy) small quantities of chemical or biological materials of concern (C/BMOC) contained in munitions and bulk containers in a hostile operational environment. C/BMOC consists of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA), Biological Warfare Agents (BWA), Non-Traditional Agents (NTA), as well as precursors.  The TacDS will operate in locations both remote and accessible, during hostile and non-hostile conditions, and within time periods of minutes to hours, to reduce the employability of C/BMOC against the joint force and/or prevent proliferation to other actors of concern. TacDS is a new capability for the Department of Defense addressing multiple capability gaps.

The MPD program is an FY19 new start intended to correct capability gaps identified within the Consequence Management ICD, dated 14 October 2010.  The program will develop an array of rugged and reliable best-of-breed hardware in a manageably sized, easy to erect, modular system that can be quickly tailored to different Mass Casualty events in order to support decontamination of ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients, and allow for the processing of contaminated human remains.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The CHRS Program will leverage existing efforts under a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement which has accelerated the CHRT project.  Additional minor design modifications, developmental and operational testing is planned as part of the overall acquisition strategy.  Product development will consist of the design and prototyping of a CHRT.  The contracting strategy will make use of The Combatting Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to procure prototype units, followed by Developmental Testing (DT).

Following DT completion, an Operational Test Agency Assessment report will be prepared and an In Process Review will be conducted to determine readiness to proceed to production and Operational Testing. A Logistics Demonstration and Operational Testing will be conducted.  An Operational Test Agency Evaluation Report will be written, and technical reviews will be conducted, in preparation for a Milestone C/Full Rate Production decision.

TACTICAL DISABLEMENT SYSTEM (TACDS)

Utilizing mature technologies, the TACDS program will take an incremental approach towards the development, integration, test and production of a family of systems (FoS).  Developmental efforts in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase (TMRR) and the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase (EMD) will be contracted through full and open competition.  Production and Deployment will also be competed through full and open competition.

MASS PERSONNEL DECON (MPD)

The MPD Program will develop the equipment, processes and procedures for DoD-affiliated personnel contaminated by chemical, biological, and radiological agents to achieve ambulatory and non-ambulatory throughput requirements as dictated by the needs of the Services, while considering various mission scenarios.  As part of the acquisition strategy, key product developmental efforts will begin with the program achieving a MS A, and includes efforts for the reduction of current MPD System sustainment costs by assessing existing MCD equipment and processes as well as new technology through the use of Request For Information from Industry's (RFI's), Market Research Analyses and Technology Demonstrations. A competitive/sole source contract for prototyping and production units will be awarded so that a combined developmental and operational testing can be performed on those assets. In-Process Review will take place followed by Milestone C/Full Rate Production Approval. These efforts will additionally support the development of hazardous waste disposal and integration with a Contaminated Human Remains capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes the development of next generation individual protective ensembles (e.g., suits, boots, and gloves) which enable the Joint Force to survive and continue the mission in chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contaminated environments.

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) Increment 2 
(2) the Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS)

In FY19, CBRN UIPE Increment 2 (UIPE 2) will transition to CBRN UIPE FoS.  This is reflected not only in the name change but in the structure of the program.  The program is designed to meet mission area needs, not individual Service needs.  There are four Mission Areas: Land, Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS solutions will seek to fulfill. (2) the Tactical All-Hazards Threat Protective Ensemble (TATPE) will be a subset to the UIPE FoS and capitalize on the protection factor of commercial Level A with design modifications to align with the necessary operational imperatives to eliminate this risk paradox. This suit serves as an additional tool in the arsenal until technology matures to the point of delivering a similar capability applied against the range of military operations in all environments under all conditions.

UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users individual percutaneous protective equipment with the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will provide protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear/Toxic Industrial Material threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  TATPE will provide high risk personnel (CBRN and Explosive Ordinance Disposal) increased protection against non-traditional and advanced threat agents during CWMD missions.  These missions are representative of chemical production or bulk storage facility defeat, chemical weapon facility defeat, and interdiction or recovery of chemical weapons/devices while in transit.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Reference UIPE FOS acquisition strategy.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (UIPE FOS)

The UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles (Land, Sea, Air and Homeland Defense) with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved form, fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  An Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach will be used to procure informational white papers during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.  UIPE FoS and the Services identified a mature solution that may meet Air Mission Area suit requirements. The program will identify data gaps from the United States Air Force's (USAF) test and evaluation of the Chemical, Biological, Radiological Layer (CBRL) of the Integrated Aircrew Ensemble. There is high confidence in the CBRL meeting the requirements for the Services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes efforts responsible for providing the information architecture and applications for shaping the battlespace against the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threat. During this phase, efforts will continue prototyping and technology development and transition efforts for new technologies and capabilities to fulfill requirements. 

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) the Global-Biosurveillance Portal (G-BSP)
(2) the Joint Effects Model 2 (JEM 2)
(3) the Joint Warning and Reporting Network 2 (JWARN 2)
(4) the Software Support Activity (SSA).

G-BSP will complete remaining efforts for prototyping, developing, and evaluating new technologies, models, and tools from both internal and external developers for transition into G-BSP, as needed. 
This will be integrated into a web-based enterprise environment that facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological hazards. This will result in a set of tools and capabilities that facilitate the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations.

JEM 2 will continue to adapt and merge emerging science and technology (S&amp;T) capability into a unified architecture and common software baseline that expedites transition of mature S&amp;T into the JEM 2 baseline.  This will be integrated into a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. This will provide warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects. Additionally, this will support planning efforts to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects integrated into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

JWARN 2 will continue integration of emerging science and technology capabilities received from Advanced Technical Development (ATD) phase and complete JWARN Technology Demonstrations and User Assessments to evaluate and prove component and subsystem maturity of critical science and technology, system performance, and validate requirements within the IT BOX construct and Agile Process developed software prototype(s). This will be integrated into an accredited DoD warning and reporting system that enables an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN and TIM incidents. This will provide a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the COP, displayed through Service provided Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) C2 systems resident at all echelons of command. Commanders will be provided with enhanced situational awareness throughout the area of operation, supports warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.

The SSA will continue required modifications to the integrated Architecture on host platforms and document the infrastructure and technical standards, developing an acquisition Cybersecurity/IA strategy and architecture products for the JWARN, JEM, Man portable radiological detection system, Radiological Detection System, Next generation Chemical detector and other JPEO CBD programs and initiatives. This will provide the Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter. This includes, but is not limited to, solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Global-Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014. The Global-BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development. The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach. IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event. Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs). There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016. A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20. The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM 2 integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM 1 and 2 development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN 2 Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2, Northrup Grumman, will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN 2 integrator, a follow-on contract was awarded in December 2018.  The follow-on contractor, DCS Corp, for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JWARN contract.  The JWARN 2 follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN 2 software development and maintenance contract.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project includes Medical Countermeasure platform technologies, Medical Countermeasures (vaccines and therapeutics), development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT)
(2) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) facility
(3) Biosafety Level 4 Good Laboratory Practice Test and Evaluation (BSL4 GLP T&amp;E)
(4) Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B)
(5) Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS)
(6) Antiviral Therapeutic (AV TX) 
(7) Filovirus Vaccine (VAC FILO)
(8) Ricin vaccine (VAC RIC)
(9) Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC VEE) 
(10) Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VAC WEVEE) Vaccine

The goal of the MCMPT is to counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the medical countermeasure (MCM) development risks. Efforts will center on leveraging the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and developing robust manufacturing processes. MCMPT will leverage platform technologies to streamline and accelerate the MCM delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risk. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. The first platform being established as part of a thirty-six month Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT). This platform provides an enduring capability from which future candidates can be manufactured. A second platform technology will be established which will focus on a vaccine platform capability.  The Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs. To achieve this goal the DOD is establishing a medical countermeasures platform (MCMPT) capability.  

The capability building effort at the DoD ADM will establish and enhance proven biopharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing technologies to accelerate the delivery of medical countermeasures as part of a medical integrated layered defense.  The return on investment is an increased level of preparedness and responsiveness to counter current and emerging chemical and biological threats. By establishing and enhancing proven enabling technologies, the DoD ADM will accelerate development of MCMs at all stages of development, enhance preparedness for existing threats, and accelerate response to emerging threats.  MCMs impacted by these efforts include: Vaccines for Viral Agents, Vaccines for Bacterial Agents and Toxins, Monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody conjugates for therapeutic and prophylactic use across all agent classes, and Adjuvants.  Funds to support the state of readiness were previously provided through individual product development and manufacturing funding lines.  In FY20 the Department is providing dedicated funds to support operational availability.

The Medical Countermeasure BSL-4 GLP T&amp;E capability performs T&amp;E and provides the essential data packages to support US Food and Drug Administration approval of leading biodefense medical countermeasure candidates to protect the Warfighter and the Nation. This capability provides dedicated capacity for DoD to conduct biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) GLP T&amp;E studies to meet programmatic needs following all applicable regulatory, biosurety, and safety standards.

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins. The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate drug was approved by the FDA in Oct 18 for Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CAPB) that was required as part of the acquisition strategy for the antibiotic repurposing program from S&amp;T to advanced development. 

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS Increment 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well-established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests. NGDS 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care. NGDS 2 will provide additional capability for diagnosis of CBR-induced diseases, suitable for use in far forward environments, by developing lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use instruments and test kits. 

The AV TX Program is continuing the development of a Ebola Zaire therapeutic treatment drug that is on the regulatory path for FDA approval as an antiviral therapeutic for the warfighter.  AV TX is continuing the development of models to test for alphavirus therapeutics that include several Natural History Studies required per FDA and animal rule regulatory requirements.  Other pathogens on the biological warfare threat list, including viruses of interest from Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae, are targets of future development efforts.  Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter.  In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation.

The VAC FILO Program develops vaccines that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses. The program office is prioritizing the development and delivery of a licensed Marburg vaccine while working with Science &amp; Technology to further develop Ebola vaccine candidates to meet the DoD requirement.  The current budget supports development of a single Marburg prototype to protect against the BW threat through TMRR phase. The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve a vaccine using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in a relevant animal model(s).

The VAC RIC program supports one DoD vaccine candidate including manufacturing GMP lots; and the continuation of animal model and assay development studies. The Ricin toxin is a validated bioweapon threat that is lethal, available and easily produced.  The VAC RIC Program concluded development activities and transferred the technology to the ADMc in FY18. 

The VAC WEVEE Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Services have prioritized the development and delivery of an FDA-licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) vaccine. In FY19 the VAC WEVEE program shifted to the VAC VEE program.  The VAC VEE program uses a parallel evaluation of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through Phase I clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation &amp; Risk Reduction phase. Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes at competitive selection. The schedule is based on a competitive selection to one prototype.  The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts. At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine. The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs. Additionally, the Program Office will partner with Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Once established, future programs will be able to leverage these platforms for the development of future medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority (OTA) through the medical OTA consortium.

ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT &amp; MANUFACTURING (ADM)

A contract was awarded to Ology Bioservices on 20 March 2013 (then Nanotherapeutics, Inc.) to establish a Department of Defense (DoD) ADM Facility to rapidly develop, approve (through FDA approval), and manufacture MCMs.  The contract was structured to be executed in two (2) phases:

Phase 1-Establish, commission and validate (facility(ies)/ equipment) for two (2) advanced development and manufacturing suites that use agile, flexible (single use, disposable), modular and multi-product technologies for MCM advanced development and manufacturing. Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 1 was completed on 31 March 2017.

Phase 2-Support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use. This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from Pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.  The first option is scheduled for completion in 2QFY19, proceeded by a second, 2-year option.

BSL4 GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES TEST &amp; EVALUATION (BSL4 GLP T&amp;E)

The Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCM) BSL-4 T&amp;E capability continues to utilize and maintain a testing capability at the existing and planned new USAMRIID facilities.  MCM BSL-4 T&amp;E costs support testing of MCMs against threats that require high-level containment using non-human primates.  The period of FY18 and beyond will continue to support the BSL-4 T&amp;E capability.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate is a transitional product from S&amp;T that showed efficacy against plague, anthrax, and other BW agents. The regulatory approach of the program is to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule. The program will conduct non-human primate studies to initial efficacy. The performer will submit Supplemental New Drug Application for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase. In FY18 PK study on non-human primates was completed for the plague indication. MS B for the program is planned for 4QFY20.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and COEs that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address. More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care. NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings.

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The Anti-viral Therapeutics program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple therapeutics through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase against the Ebola (Zaire), Marburg, Sudan and alpha virus bio warfare threats.  The initial therapeutic candidate is for the Ebola Zaire that is scheduled for a Milestone B decision review in FY19.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies for FDA approval.  The acquisition strategy for each indication will have the performers submitting New Drug applications for the therapeutics during the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phases.

FILOVIRUS (VAC FILO)

The Filovirus Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple vaccines through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  During this phase a manufacturing process is developed.  This process will be used to produce current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots suitable for Phase 1 clinical trials.  In addition, animal safety and efficacy studies will be conducted to support an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to the FDA and conduct Phase 1 clinical trials.  These efforts will support a MS B decision and entry into the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  At Milestone B (MS B), the best Marburg vaccine prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with the delivery of an FDA licensed Marburg vaccine.  It is anticipated that the EMD phase contract will be a mix of Cost Plus and Fixed Price.  In addition, the program office may leverage the Advanced Development and Manufacturing capability, and other DoD agencies and laboratories to include the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).  Following a successful MS B, the program will conduct manufacturing qualification/validation, expanded clinical and nonclinical testing, and assay qualification and validation efforts.  These efforts will support the Biological Licensure Application (BLA) submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensure of a Marburg vaccine.

RICIN VACCINE (VAC RIC)

The Ricin Vaccine Program acquisition strategy supported the development of a single vaccine through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase that will offer protection against the threat of aerosolized ricin toxin.  The Government will serve as the integrator during the TMRR phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts.  The JPdM MCS-JVAP?s planned path for standing the program down involved completion of non-clinical studies and assay work to bring these efforts to an equivalent TRL as the Ricin clinical studies. An Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed by the MDA in May 2017, concurring with the stand down plan and also supported the establishment of GMP manufacturing at the ADMc facility.

VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (VAC VEE)

The VAC VEE acquisition strategy uses a parallel evaluation of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and Virus Like Particle (VLP) vaccine prototypes through Phase I clinical trials to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation &amp; Risk Reduction phase. Several potential decision points will be used to assess the prototypes at competitive selection. The schedule is based on a competitive selection to one prototype. The Government will serve as the integrator during this phase by managing and coordinating the various vaccine development efforts. At MS B, the best prototype will be selected through a full and open competition to transition to the EMD phase, with delivery of a FDA-licensed WEVEE vaccine. The development efforts will be a Cost Plus and Firm Fixed Price CLINs. Additionally, the Program Office will partner with Health and Human Services/National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (HHS/NIAID), DoD agencies, and laboratories to include USAMRIID. This DoD program is the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures lead for the advanced development of this vaccine and is leveraging expertise across the Federal and International sectors to ensure programmatic success.

WESTERN EASTERN VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPH VACCINE (VAC WEVEE)

The VAC WEVEE Vaccine program initiated competitive prototypes in FY13 to reduce program risk, and is developing multiple prototypes through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase.  The VAC WEVEE Vaccine will protect the Warfighter against aerosolized exposure to three strains of alphaviruses; Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.  Services have prioritized the development and delivery of a licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEEV) vaccine.  In FY19 the VAC WEVEE program shifted to the VAC VEE program</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the development of medical materiel and other medical equipment items necessary for the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase of the acquisition life cycle for the advanced development of Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical warfare agents including diagnostic equipment, prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs, and individual/casualty decontamination compounds.  A family-of-systems approach for medical defense against chemical warfare agents is required to provide protection, to sustain performance in a chemical environment, and to provide for self-aid/buddy-aid and medical treatment of chemical casualties.  Fielding of prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and medical devices requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  Given the family-of-systems approach for development of chemical MCMs for the treatment of nerve agent intoxication, multiple long-term studies are required to obtain FDA approval to deliver products that effectively integrate with current and projected therapeutic regimens.  Efficacy testing of most candidate drugs against chemical warfare agents cannot be conducted in humans; therefore, animal surrogate models must be developed and employed.  

The program currently includes: 
(1) Emerging Threats (EMRT)
(2) Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) 

The EMRT program is now called the Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS) in FY20 MC5.  The ROCS program is conducting the development and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic medical countermeasures (MCMs). The purpose of the MCM is to provide therapeutic benefits to the Joint Service warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) as a high priority. The first increment of the ROCS program will develop a naloxone autoinjector as a rescue treatment that will counteract the adverse effects from exposure to opioids.

The INATS advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) to treat current and emerging threats and (2) insertion of a centrally-acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  Based on recent guidance from the FDA there is no longer a need to expand the pretreatment indications for pyridostigmine bromide (PB) beyond the nerve agent soman.  Therefore, the Joint Project Manager for Chemical Defense Pharmaceuticals (JPdM CDP) will execute nonclinical studies to demonstrate the safety of PB when used as a pretreatment should agents other than soman be encountered. The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA). The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>EMERGING THREAT CHEMICAL THERAPEUTICS (EMRT)

The ROCS program is an approved Middle Tier/Rapid Prototyping acquisition program to develop the naloxone autoinjector within 5 years.  A market survey has been conducted that identified several advanced development candidates.  Other Transactional Authority agreements and Task Orders will be utilized to bring on board a commercial partner.  Once FDA approval has been granted the program will transition from Rapid Prototyping to Rapid Fielding or a traditional production and fielding pathway.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

Oxime Component - The development of a new and improved oxime, MMB4, (replacing 2-PAM) to treat current and emerging nerve agent threats, is one component of the INATS Development Program. Both the oxime and the centrally acting components are required to address the current and emerging nerve agent threat and to mitigate their effects. MMB4 is a relatively new chemical entity transitioning from Science and Technology Development. MMB4 requires the conduct of studies to resume the Phase 1 Clinical Trial, preparation for the Phase 2 clinical trials, the manufacturing of the drug product for both these trials, the conduct of non-clinical studies to determine toxicity, and the conduct of premonitory studies to determine the impact of nerve transmissions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of an array of reconnaissance, detection and identification equipment, and warning systems.  

Efforts included in this Project are: 
(1) Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD)
(2) Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD)
(3) The Joint Handheld Bio-Agent Identifier (JHBI)
(4) Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS)
(5) Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD)
(6) Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD)
(7) Reactive Chemistry Orthogonal Surface and Environmental Threat Ticket Array (ROSETTA)
(8) Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS) 1, also known as Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite (NBCRV SS)
(9) Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS)
(10) Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD 1,2,3,4)
(11) Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) Defense Support; (12) the Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiatives (GBTI)

In FY18, the Next Generation Chemical Detector (NGCD) funding line was broken out into NGCD 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Starting in FY19, four program unique funding lines exist: AVCAD (formerly NGCD 1), PCAD (formerly NGCD 2), MPCAD (formerly NGCD 3), and WCAD (formerly NGCD 4). NGCD will detect and identify non-traditional agents, chemical warfare agents (CWA), toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) in the air and on surfaces.  The NGCD will provide improved NTA/CWA/TIC selectivity and sensitivity in multiple environments.  The sensors will improve detection, consequence management and reconnaissance, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) interdiction capabilities.  The scope of the project includes Presumptive detection (AVCAD, PCAD, WCAD) and field level Confirmation, Identification, and Quantification (MPCAD) detection of chemicals a few feet away from the detector as well as at the sampling point of the detector.  Additional tasks will ruggedize and test a system for nontraditional agent detection for special purpose units.  NGCD funded a USSOCOM effort to develop a modification kit to JCAD to address NTA and threats of interests going into the SP SKO and SPU units.

The AVCAD supports the Priority Objective to deny the effects of current and emerging threats.  The AVCAD system will be the first chemical aerosol detector fielding by any military, worldwide.  AVCAD will fill critical gaps in current chemical sensor capabilities in the areas of aerosol Chemical Warfare Agent detection, and detection of specific advanced threat agents/Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).  The AVCAD will also detect residual vapors to prevent/mitigate health effects associated with low concentration exposures. The U.S. Military Departments view the AVCAD as a high-priority program and will use the system to support their missions, which include monitoring, collective protection, base defense, decontamination, unmasking, reconnaissance, and shipboard and aviation platform chemical detection. In FY20, AVCAD will support testing and continue development of the EMD phase. 

The MPCAD provides all states of matter, to include chemical solids, liquids, aerosols and vapors, and will support the Commander's tactical and operational decisions regarding avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures and immediate treatment by providing real-time, near-laboratory grade sample analysis.  The Army and Marine Corp will employ MPCAD in Dismounted Reconnaissance and Site Assessment missions to substantiate presumptive detector results.  The Air Force will employ the MPCAD to support Post-Event Reconnaissance in support of Reconnaissance and Surveillance missions by monitoring the environment at airbases after a chemical release.  The Air Force will continuously monitor contaminated areas for chronic health effects levels through analysis of samples from collectors deployed at the contamination site and brought back to the analyzer for identification and quantification. This information will support commander decisions to determine Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels and eventual termination of cordon restrictions. In FY20, MPCAD is continuing testing to support EMD development.

The PCAD provides the Joint Services a handheld capability to locate and detect trace amounts of liquids and solids on surfaces.  Efforts to mature technologies during Technology Maturation Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase resulted in systems that were too heavy and cumbersome to use.  Program office is working with users and JSTO to identify technologies to mature that may meet the users' needs for a hand held, non-contact, areal detection system.  Concurrently with the PCAD TMRR efforts, Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC) was exploring the use of adapting the Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) to detect explosives.  The project was called JCAD Chemical Explosive Detector (CED).  The theory of operation is a JCAD is inserted into a cradle that has a heated inlet and modified library to detect explosives.  An operator swabs a surface with a probe and inserts the probe into heated inlet and the resulting vapors are interrogated by the JCAD.  The effort was expanded for the system to detect NTAs, and Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs).  The program changed its name to JCAD Solid/Liquid Adapter (SLA) kit to better match its true capabilities.  The JCAD SLA kit is planned to be added to the M4A1 JCAD program as an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item. In FY20 the JCAD SLA will use the JCAD BA7 line. 

The MMPRDS provides advanced platform-mounted radiological/nuclear (RN) crew monitoring/detection, reconnaissance, and surveillance for multiple manned and unmanned U.S. Army ground and rotary wing vehicles. The system, which can also be integrated into fixed site sensor payloads, provides both point (VIPER prototype) and standoff (MERLIN prototype) RN detection capabilities that replace AN/UDR-13 and AN/VDR-2 systems. Funding supports advanced development of MERLIN and VIPER prototypes for integration onto the Stryker NBCRV and medium-sized unmanned ground platforms.  VIPER will also be integrated into the M1A2, Bradley, Black Hawk, and other major U.S. Army platforms (for point detection). 

The EMBD is the Navy's automated biological point detection, collection and identification system.  EMBD replaces/upgrades the 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) currently fielded to the Navy and provides 40 systems for new construction ships.  EMBD improves detection sensitivity providing the Navy the ability to "detect to inform" reducing the number of contaminated ships during a biological warfare agent attack, minimizing sailor casualties. EMBD reduces false alarm rates, modernizes the computing architecture and increases reliability and sailors confidence in the system.  These improvements decrease fleet O&amp;S costs, and reduces the obsolescence issues with current biological detection capability. The EMBD program will complete production and testing, integration and field a lower cost biological point detection system. In FY20, EMBD will complete EMD (Engineering and Manufacturing Development) DT/OT (Developmental Testing/Operational Testing) and move to Milestone C.

The JHBI program is a Joint Service Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program consisting of two increments to address an existing United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requirement for handheld, multiplexed, environmental, bio-agent identification.  The JHBI program was initiated under the JBTDS program and will provide two different handheld bio-identification systems for the rapid and accurate identification of organisms at the point of contact for multiple mission types.  The proposed JHBI systems will be handheld, Polymerase Chain Reaction-based, multiplexed devices for the analysis of powder or liquid environmental biological samples.  JHBI capabilities will provide Special Operations Forces with timely and accurate identification of 8 or more bio-agents at the point of need.  JHBI 1 is anticipated to serve as a supplemental capability to the BioFire RAZOR with JHBI 2 fielding the complete replacement of the RAZOR by FY20.  JHBI transitioned from JBTDS to its own funding line in FY18. 

The ROSETTA is a modernization effort to provide a higher confidence chemical liquid hazard detection ticket in the currently fielded M256A2 kit for the Warfighter to make timely decisions.  These decisions will reduce casualties and improve the combat effectiveness of troops engaged in conflicts involving the use of chemical warfare agents. ROSETTA is based on colorimetric technology and will be eye-readable and ease the Warfighter from current training and operational burden.  In addition, the ROSETTA ticket will provide improved hazard detection performance with reduced false alarm rate, potential for increased number of chemicals detected, reduced detection time especially for certain compounds of interest, and potential for integration onto unmanned platforms especially micro-sized unmanned aerial sensors.  The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services. In FY20, ROSETTA will award contract(s) for technical data package testing.

The JNBCRS 1, including the Styker NBCRV SSU, provides maneuver formations the ability to conduct mounted reconnaissance and surveillance missions of CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs).  The NBCRV SSU will answer the commander's priority intelligence requirements (PIR), and facilitate proactive risk-based decisions to ensure freedom of action and survivability.  A modern and capable NBCRV SSU is a critical component for Joint Force success when operating in the complex CBRN environment.  Operating with combat vehicles fighting against increasingly capable and determined enemies requires like capability with regard to protection, mobility, and lethality.  The NBCRV SSU will accomplish this by integrating the capability for command and control of unmanned systems with CBRN payload.  The NBCRV SSU will provide a CBRN detection, tipping and queuing system to accomplish desired standoff distances to keep the warfighter out of harm's way and reduce sustainment costs over the current system.  A Chemical Surface Detector (CSD) will be developed to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System to increase maneuver speed when conducting NBC missions and increase reliability.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.  In FY20, NBCRV SSU program will develop a prototype of integrated sensors for demonstration in Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020.

The JBTDS program is developing, integrating and testing the first lightweight, low-cost biological surveillance system to detect, collect, and identify Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) aerosols.  JBTDS provides warning through the Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) and archives samples for follow-on analyses.  JBTDS provides near real-time local audio and visual alarm and may be employed by any Military User.  JBTDS components are man-portable, battery-operable and easy to employ.  JBTDS provides notification of a hazard and enhances battle space awareness to protect and preserve the forces.  When networked JBTDS augments existing biological detection systems providing a theater-wide array capable of biological detection, identification and warning to support time sensitive force protection decisions.  The JBTDS provides surface sampling capability which interfaces with the JBTDS identifier to support sensitive site exploitation missions.  In FY20, JBTDS will complete program record testing and prepare for a Milestone decision.  

The NTA Defense Program is the Joint Project Executive Office of Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO CBRND) lead for DoD, Interagency, and international work pertaining to PBAs and other emerging threats. The NTA Defense program assesses existing and new portfolio capabilities against PBAs and other emerging threats to develop dedicated initiatives and projects to transition information, technologies, and capabilities into acquisition programs across all commodity areas.  System prototyping and modification efforts serve to advance capabilities, reduce risk, and provide improved knowledge for decision making. 

GBTI will research and characterize laboratory networks and develop algorithms to identify key nodes, having the greatest potential to compress the time between disease event initiation and the production of actionable data.  In FY19, GBTI will close.  The Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) will track projects of mutual interest, formerly under GBTI, with the Chemical Biological Defense Program.  The Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) an initiative under Defense Biological Product Assurance Program (DBPAO) will leverage the investments made under GBTI.  The (TARMAC) effort will transition to the Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP) project MB5 line in FY20</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>NEXT GENERATION CHEMICAL DETECTOR (NGCD)

In FY19 NGCD program divides into separate three programs.  Efforts will continue in FY19 under the separate programs, AVCAD, PCAD, MPCAD funding lines.

AEROSOL VAPOR CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (AVCAD)

Aerosol &amp; Vapor Chemical Agent Detector (AVCAD) awarded MS B Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contracts with production options. The AVCAD program will conduct risk reduction testing with prototypes prior to full EMD DT Testing to support the MSC/LRIP decision.

MULTI-PHASE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (MPCAD)

The Multi-Phase Chemical Agent Detector (MPCAD) (formerly NGCD 3) is using a streamlined acquisition strategy.  The MPCAD EMD contract(s) are utilizing the Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for EMD items.  The MPCAD will procure production items through a follow-on CWMD OTA or Federal Acquisition Regulation based contract.  The program will develop and validate the systems during EMD.

PROXIMATE CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (PCAD)

The Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) (formerly NGCD 2) supports the efforts associated with the PCAD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).  The AoA is reassessing the PCAD Capability requirements with each of the Joint Services and determining the state of technologies necessary to meet the users capability needs.  It is believed that technology will need to transition back to S&amp;T to further mature.  In the interim the program office will support the JCAD SLA kit design finalization by continuing to fund the JCAD manufacturer, Smith's Detection Inc. to complete its addition of an NTA and opioid libraries, test and evaluate the system and to incorporate the JCAD SLA kit as an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item to the M4A1 JCAD program. The production decision is the approval of the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) that adds the JCAD SLA as an AAL item to the M4A1 JCAD.

ENHANCED MARITIME BIOLOGICAL DETECTION (EMBD)

The Enhanced Maritime Biological Detection (EMBD) program uses a streamlined acquisition strategy and acquired a Milestone B decision in June 2018.  EMBD will replace/upgrade 135 Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS) in the Navy and provide 40 systems for new construction ships.  In July 2018 EMBD awarded a contract through Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition and Production/Procurement (JE-RDAP) contract for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).

GLOBAL BIO TECH INITIATIVE (GBTI)

The Global Biosurveillance Technology Initiative (GBTI) strategy establishes a robust data stream that directly supports existing programs of record in their development of biological defense countermeasures through the characterization of laboratory networks and augmentation of key nodes within those networks.  This will be accomplished through the use of a University of Affiliated Research Center (Johns Hopkins University) to characterize laboratory networks and develop decision-making tools for evaluating potential augmentation of key nodes prior to investment.  The GBTI program is sun-setting.  FY19 will be the last year of funding.

JOINT BIO TACTICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (JBTDS)

The Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) program awarded a full and open contract to Chemring Sensors and Electronic Systems (CSES) in the 3rd Quarter of FY15 for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP). JBTDS is funding and participating in the Biological Point System Assessment (BPSA). BPSA provides an assessment of all biological detection, collection, and identification alternative technologies to assess system maturity, suitability and effectiveness to meet JBTDS requirements.

JOINT HANDHELD BIO-AGENT IDENTIFIER (JHBI)

The JHBI program will pursue a collaborative accelerated acquisition strategy to incrementally deliver capability to USSOCOM.  JHBI will use commercial items to procure candidate systems from two vendors for further development and fielding.  JHBI is co-managed and co-executed through an acquisition partnership between the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) and USSOCOM to expand the relationship between JPEO-CBD and USSOCOM and leverage acquisition and subject matter expertise on both sides to reduce acquisition timelines and improve customer satisfaction.  Specifically, JHBI is using the USSOCOM requirement validation and test and evaluation resources from program inception through Milestone C, awarded 3Q18.  Developmental Testing (DT) was completed in 2QFY18.  Full Rate Production (FRP) will begin 4QFY18.  The JHBI program acquired test-articles of a single commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) platform with relevant assays for the JHBI Combat Evaluation (CV), which served as the decision gate for the completion of the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase.  To mitigate risk, additional technologies were identified and inserted into the JHBI program.

JOINT NBC RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEM - STRYKER (JNBCRS)

Joint Nuclear Biological Chemical Radiological System (JNBCRS), includes the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite Upgrade (NBCRV SSU).  The acquisition strategy for the Stryker NBCRV SSU is to integrate mature sensors into the Stryker NBCRV to support Joint Warfighter Assessment 2019 and system level testing.  Following the testing and demonstration, the hardware and software will be fixed and updated for Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020 and test.  The Joint Warfighter Assessments will provide user feedback and operational data to support programmatic and technical decisions. An In Progress Review will be held after Joint Warfighter Assessment 2020 and system testing to approve a Modification Work Order for fielding.  This schedule was accelerated from the previous schedule based on the maturity of the sensor and guidance from the Chief of Staff of the Army.

MOUNTED MANNED PLATFORM RADIOLOGICAL DETECTION SYSTEM (MMPRDS)

The Mounted Manned Platform Radiological Detection System (MMPRDS) is a Modified Work Order of the Stryker Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle Sensor Suite Upgrade's radiological sensor system.  MMPRDS includes interior-mounted (VIPER) to detect and protect the crew and exterior-mounted (MERLIN) vehicle sensors to facilitate radiological reconnaissance.  This is a rapid development of an enhanced radiological sensor system using rapid prototypes transitioned from Defense Threat Reduction Agency-Nuclear Technologies (DTRA/NT) in September 2018. The MMPRDS is utilizing the Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) for the production ready test assets. The MMPRDS will procure production items through a Federal Acquisition Regulation based contract.

NON TRADITIONAL AGENT DEFENSE (NTA DEFENSE)

The NTA Defense program will transition information, technologies, and capabilities for PBAs and other emerging threats into existing and future acquisition programs (PORs, ECD/ACDs, and Accelerated Acquisition) and utilize a variety of contract mechanisms (full and open competition, existing task order contracts within DoD).

REACTIVE CHEMISTRY ORTHOGONAL SURFACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT TICKET ARRAY (ROSETTA)

ROSETTA will use a streamlined approach. This approach is based on technology that will transition from Science and Technology Efforts and industry.  It will be developed using the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) OTA to award multiple development contracts. The M256A3 Production Contract will use Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) to purchase the new kits. The ROSETTA funding will complete the development and testing of the new ROSETTA ticket as well as update the currently fielded M256A2 technical data package via an engineering change proposal (ECP) to create a new M256A3 kit that will be available to all Services.The M256A3 kit will replace the M256A2 kit by attrition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development of common analytical laboratory system capabilities to conduct on-site analysis of any unknown sample and test potential life-threatening substances.

The effort included in this project is:
(1) Common Analytical Laboratory System capability (CALS)

The CALS will provide common analytical capabilities packaged to meet the specific CONOPS and mission of the gaining unit to detect and identify Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs). Users of the system will include the National Guard Bureau, the Army 20th Support Command, the Army Medical Laboratory, the Air Force, and the Navy.  There will be two variants of CALS, the Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) and the Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS). The TV-IS is currently in the EMD phase, with proto-types built and testing that begins in February 2019 and concludes in FY2020.

Theater Validation Integrated System (TV-IS) Variant - Army User - A lab with a high level of confidence in analytical results through the use of orthogonal (complimentary) technologies and an expanded analytical suite that employs multiple standardized ISO containers, which will be integrated onto one Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and two trailers.

Field Confirmatory Analytical Capability Sets (FC-ACS) Variant - Army, Navy, Air Force and NGB User - A transportable equipment subset that allows
them to be loaded into transport cases and palletized if required. FC-ACS is post Milestone C and is not a RDTE funded part of CALS, it is in the production phase.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production of Joint Service Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) Collective Protection (CP) systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in CBR environments. 

The systems included in this project are: 
(1) Chemical-Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) 
(2) Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP) Family of Systems, to include Collective Protection Filters a Congressional add.

The CASB will provide a lightweight, low-cost, expendable, negative-pressure enclosure that will protect the interior of multi-service aircraft (MH-47, CV22, MC-130) capable of airlifting/exfiltrating chemically or biologically contaminated personnel, equipment, and cargos while preserving the aircraft for continued unrestricted operations without need for extensive decontamination.  CASB will field a capability that will support the overall intent of the (Aircraft CBRN Contamination Survivability ACCS) Initial Capabilities Development (ICD) in the areas of barriers, aircraft containment systems, modular Collective Protection (ColPro) for aircraft interiors, and disposable ColPro.  CASB is one member of a family of systems that will support the ICD.  It will protect the interior of DoD airlift assets (MH-47, CV-22, and MC-130s) from incidental cross-contamination by CB-contaminated personnel and equipment and cargos under transport.  

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  JECP is a family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone CP systems and kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits to provide CBRN protection to other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.

Congressional Interest Item -The Collective Protection Filters for Gas-Phase Contaminants project will develop and test innovative filters which do not require any adjustments to an existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit to provide a level of chemical protection.  The development of a prototype filter will be used in retrofitting buildings to enhance protection capabilities while reducing the installation costs.  The Mobile Platform Collective Protection Filter Design Modernization project will develop and test a new filter system design that will reduce the number of filters in the mobile collective protection portfolio from 4 to 1, provide a universal air handling system for all mobile platforms, and use modern materials and manufacturing techniques to update 1950s era designs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL AIRCRAFT SURVIVABILITY BARRIER (CASB)

The Chemical-Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) overall strategy is to utilize primary materials (air filtration and flexible barrier material) currently in use by other programs in the CB defense portfolio in a negative pressure system specifically designed for airframe use.  CASB will review existing materials and technology as well as designs, configurations, and test data from legacy systems developed for ColPro applications.  Using this information, systems will be developed to meet the broader range of airframes and airframe specific requirements, chemical biological protection and logistic supportability that are now required.  Based on commonality between the requirements of the CASB and the requirements of similar programs (i.e. Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection, TIS, and Aeromedical Biological Containment System), CASB will be initiated at MS B EMD phase to meet these expanded requirements within the various airframes.  CASB will leverage an IDIQ contract to pursue a Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) development strategy using full and open competition for awards following MS B and MS C. During the EMD phase, CASB intends to award a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) delivery order for the development and delivery of prototypes for airworthiness certification within two years.  During the Production phase, CASB intends to pursue a Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) delivery order to reduce the logistical burden and sustainment costs.

JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Production and Deployment Phases of the program. Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 through the now expired contract with Leidos in support of Initial Operational Capability (IOC).  A competitive build-to-print follow-on production delivery order under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition, and Production (JE-RDAP) Contract will be awarded to support the remaining production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). Phase 2 systems will be developed as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate JE-RDAP competitive delivery order and undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision. Production options are included in the delivery order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems.  Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS. BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various fielded environmental control unit interface types for use with collective protection. These efforts involve a simplified acquisition procurement contract and exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems utilizing solutions that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.  ConMit systems provide a force restoration capability for units that become contaminated.  Development efforts will provide systems that reduce operational impact and logistics burden, reduce sustainment costs, increase safety, and minimize environmental effects associated with decontamination and contamination mitigation operations. Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, Concept of Operations and Tactics, Techniques &amp; Procedures.

Efforts included in this Project are:
(1) Contaminated Human Remains System (CHRS)
(2) Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP)
(3) Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Contamination Indicator Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS)
(4) DFoS General Purpose Decontaminant (GPD)
(5) Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS).  

The CHRS Program is based on capability gaps identified within both the Contamination Mitigation Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), dated March 2011, and the Mortuary Affairs ICD, dated October 2008. The program will provide a Contaminated Human Remains Transfer Case (CHRT) packaging solution to safely repatriate chemical, biological, or radiological contaminated human remains to the Continental United States, a gap identified within the Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) Initial Capabilities Document. The CHRT is a containment system that will protect personnel from the hazards associated with transporting human remains that are potentially contaminated with chemical, biological or radiological agents and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) without posing additional risk to the handlers or the environment in accordance with federal and international transportation standards. 

The MDAP Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Initiative ensures weapon system programs at all Acquisition Category (ACAT) levels, as well as non-DoD agency programs such as those programs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meet their CBRN defense requirements.  This effort facilitates and coordinates the research, development, test and evaluation, procurement, delivery, and life cycle sustainment of affordable CBRN defense materiel solutions for each program's documented CBRN requirements.

DFoS CIDAS is a contamination indicator/decontamination assurance technology.  It will consist of an indicator and an applicator, for which there will be three applicator configurations (small-scale, tactical large scale, and reusable large scale applicators) and three indicator formulations (nerve training, nerve and blister indicators).  The indicator will be sprayed on tactical vehicles, aircraft, ships, crew-served weapons, and individual weapons that may have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional chemical contamination.  DFoS CIDAS is a new capability for the Joint Forces that will reduce the logistics burden of decontamination by indicating presence and location of traditional (Nerve and Blister) and non-traditional chemical agents on militarily relevant surfaces pre- and post-decontamination.

DFoS GPD is a liquid, field adjustable decontaminant for chemical and biological agents that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crewserved weapons, and individual/personal weapons in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to traditional and non-traditional CB contamination while providing the lowest logistical footprint. 

 The JBADS will provide the capability to conduct biological agent decontamination of the interior and exterior of the C-130 aircraft.  The JBADS is a capability set that will include a shelter to encapsulate an airframe, a decontamination delivery system (e.g. hot-humid air-blower, etc.), environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components required to ensure efficacious biological agent decontamination.  It will provide the capability to decontaminate biologically contaminated aircraft to safe levels and allow more rapid return to service.  Future capability may address biological decontamination of vehicles and additional aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CONTAMINATED HUMAN REMAINS SYSTEM (CHRS)

The CHRS Program will leverage existing efforts under a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement which has accelerated the CHRT project.  Additional minor design modifications, developmental and operational testing is planned as part of the overall acquisition strategy.  Product development will consist of the design and prototyping of a CHRT.  The contracting strategy will make use of The Combatting Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to procure prototype units, followed by Developmental Testing (DT).

Following DT completion, an Operational Test Agency Assessment report will be prepared and an In Process Review will be conducted to determine readiness to proceed to production and Operational Testing. A Logistics Demonstration and Operational Testing will be conducted.  An Operational Test Agency Evaluation Report will be written, and technical reviews will be conducted, in preparation for a Milestone C/Full Rate Production decision.

MAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAM (MDAP)

The MDAP program provides assistance to non-CBD programs with meeting and or optimizing their Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) survivability and force protection capabilities.  The MDAP also provides systems engineering analyses to develop CBRN specific operational and technical requirements, identifies performance gaps between existing materiel and technical requirements, develops cost and schedule estimates, conducts preliminary CBRN T&amp;E and logistics planning, develops CBRN defense architectures products, and performs trade space analyses for a number of non-CBD programs.

DFoS CONTAMINATION INDICATOR DECONTAMINATION ASSURANCE SYSTEM (DFoS CIDAS)

The DFoS CIDAS program will follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy in consonance with user developed capability documents.  Following MS A, the program office collaborated with external efforts, including the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Development Operational Demonstration and Extended User Evaluations, and conducted technology demonstrations on candidate indicator and applicator technologies to mitigate risk and identify affordable mature technologies that meet requirements.  The DFoS CIDAS program determined the need for and initiated Government designed reusable and tactical large scale applicators to provide affordable solutions to meet specific User requirements.  Following MS B, the program used full and open competition to award a performance based indefinite quantity contract with fixed price incentive successive target contract line items, with options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) for nerve indicator and small scale applicator systems.  The DFoS CIDAS program will award a sole source, performance based indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for a blister technology.  The program will integrate the Contractor and Government designed indicator and applicators and conduct developmental and operational testing.

DFoS GENERAL PURPOSE DECONTAMINANT (DFoS GPD)

Due to the maturity levels of the systems entering the Technology Development (TD) phase, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which approved DFoS GPD to by-pass Milestone (MS) B and enter directly to MS C Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).  During the TD Phase, the DFoS GPD Program employed a Competitive Prototyping (CP) effort to facilitate the evaluation of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial and Non-Developmental Items (NDI), utilizing full and open competition.  As the DFoS GPD Program entered the final phase of Technology Development (Developmental Test), the program continued to follow an evolutionary acquisition strategy.  Following the MS C/LRIP decision, the program acquired the technical data package rights to DFoS GPD and is in the process of establishing an organic production line at Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) to produce DFoS GPD to meet production quantities.

JOINT BIOLOGICAL AGENT DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM (JBADS)

The JBADS acquisition approach is to leverage information and technology from the JBADS Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) to support entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition cycle. The EMD is supported by a Technology Readiness Assessment of 7 from the JCTD. Following testing, the JBADS will transition to Full-Rate Production. The JBADS will utilize Commercial-off-the-Shelf components for the shelter, the decontamination delivery system, the environmental control and monitoring system(s), and other ancillary components with the award of a competitive delivery order to produce, operate, and sustain the system. The program as a whole utilizes the evolutionary acquisition approach for future increments that may expand JBADS capabilities to include other platforms (aircraft and vehicles) as requirements dictate. In FY20 procurement, JBADS is purchasing 1 system for Production Verification Testing (PVT), modification/refurbishment, and fielding activities through FY22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) for individual protection equipment, with the goal of providing equipment that allows the individual Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine to operate in a contaminated Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment with little or no degradation of his/her performance.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Special Purpose Unit (SPU) Rapid Capability Development and Deployment (RCDD)
(2) Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM) Rotary Wing (RW), JSAM for Strategic Aircraft (SA), JSAM for Tactical Aircraft (TA)
(3) Uniform Integrated Protective Ensemble (UIPE) Family of Systems (FoS)

SPU RCDD will facilitate rapid JPEO-CBRND/JPL SOF RCDD response to near-term and emergent chemical-biological defensive capability requirements from elements of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Force (SOF) Enterprise such as Combatant Commanders Response Forces (CRFs) and other Joint Force enabling units such as the 20th Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives Command.  This funding directly underwrites operational relevance in a challenging geo-political landscape and within an ever-increasing threat environment. SPU RCDD mitigates risk across the CBDP by creating a portfolio of operationally-relevant CB capabilities that can be quickly transitioned to needed elements and formations of the joint force, in whole or part, in response to the articulated, emergent capability needs of the geographic combatant commanders.  These objectives are met by the early transitioning of promising science and technologies (S&amp;T) from the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) among others; the focused conduct of combat evaluations and mission-oriented operational assessments to assess technological and mission suitability; and the active leveraging of existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products along with novel redesign approaches to optimize existing solutions to new challenges supported by "buy-try-decide-acquire" acquisition strategies.

The JSAM RW, JSAM SA, and JSAM TA are Acquisition Category (ACAT) III programs developed to provide respiratory and ocular protection.  The JSAM is a lightweight Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective mask for most United States Army (USA), Navy (USN), Air Force (USAF), and Marine Corps (USMC) rotary wing and fixed wing aircrew.  All JSAM variants will be compatible with most Below-The-Neck (BTN) CB protection ensembles and existing Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE).  They will include a protective hood assembly, CB filter, blower assembly (except JSAM SA), and an intercom for ground communication.  They will also provide flame protection, demist/emergency demist (except JSAM SA), and anti-drowning features.  The goal of the JSAM programs is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain an aircrew respirator system that, in conjunction with BTN clothing ensembles, will provide the capability for all aircrew to operate in an actual or perceived CB warfare environment.  

The JSAM RW mask is being developed for use by pilots and aircrew in the majority of DoD RW aircraft in the USA (H-60, H-6, H-47, H-72), USAF (H-1 and H-60), and USN/USMC (H-60, H-1, and H-53).  The JSAM RW will integrate with most BTN CB ensembles, normal aircrew flight equipment, and RW flight helmets.  The system contains a removable face plate, allowing the user to fly "face free" in Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 3 (garment, boots, and mask) and easily install the face plate when the threat level dictates, thereby reducing physiological and psychological burden.  If threat level warrants, the user can install their face plate into an already donned hood and enter MOPP 4 (garments, boots, gloves and mask) without removing their flight helmet.  

The JSAM SA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select toxic industrial chemicals for USAF (E-3, E-8, C-135s, C-17, C-145, C-146, C-130s, C-5), Aeromedical personnel (C-130s, KC-10, U-18, CV-22, KC-135, C-12s, KC-46), USN (P-8, E-6, C-40, C-12, C-20), USMC (C-9, C-12, C-20, UC-35), and USA (RC-7, C-12s, C-20, C-26, UC-35, C-37) strategic aircrew.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM SA will provide pressure breathing for altitude for aircraft that do not require pressure breathing for gravity.  JSAM SA will integrate with aircraft subsystems which include aviation life support equipment, aircrew flight equipment, aircraft seating, portable aircrew systems, communications systems, and aircraft oxygen systems.  

The JSAM TA mask will provide individual respiratory, ocular, and percutaneous protection of chemical and biological warfare agents, and select toxic industrial chemicals for USAF (F-22 A), USN (C-2 A, E-2 C/D, E/A-18G, F/A-18 A/C/E/F), and USMC (F/A-18 A/C/D, AV-8B, KC-130J and MV-22) tactical aircrew members.  The mask components will be optimized to minimize their impact on the wearer's performance and maximize its ability to interface with aircrew protective clothing.  JSAM TA will be compatible with anti-G systems, providing Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) protection without degrading protection against Gravity Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) up to 9 Gz.  JSAM TA will integrate with essential aircraft subsystems.  

Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble (UIPE) Family of Systems (FoS).  UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the broad spectrum of users with individual percutaneous protective equipment allowing the ability to operate in a contaminated environment with no or minimal degradation in performance.  UIPE FoS will provide protection from operationally relevant traditional, non-traditional, and advanced chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear/Toxic Industrial Material threats likely to be encountered during joint force operations.  

In FY19, Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 2 (UIPE 2) will be moved under Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Family of Systems (UIPE FoS) because the program will have more than one solution to meet the Warfighters needs.  This is reflected in not only the name change but in the structure of the program.  Instead of the program being driven towards meeting individual Service needs, the program is designed to meet mission area needs.  There are four Mission Areas: Land, Air, Sea, and Homeland Defense.  Each of the Mission Areas has unique mission requirements that the UIPE FoS solutions will seek to fulfill.

The acquisition strategy allows for multiple decision points throughout product development, which provides flexibility to accelerate mature commercial-off the-shelf/non-developmental item solutions and fully develop less mature solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SPU RAPID CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT (SPU RCDD)

SOF RCDD plans to execute non-traditional programs for capabilities identified by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Force (SOF) Enterprise, and other Joint Force enabling units. The SPU RCDD BA5 acquisition strategy for developmental efforts will allow rapid prototyping and testing of mission critical capabilities needed to enhance mission success. The SPU RCDD BA7 modernization effort will use technical and functional evaluations of currently-fielded items to introduce and incorporate operationally-relevant system developments.  Both efforts will be accomplished by awarding an agreement through the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA) for the procurement of test assets. An OTA contracting approach will be used to procure test prototypes and test articles of possible solutions. The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program. Procurement will be through either the OTAs, a Small Business Innovative Research contract, or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK ROTARY WING (JSAM RW)

The JSAM RW was developed under a competitive Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract, that included JSAM Apache and JSAM Apache Block III.  A sole source Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) contract was awarded for LRIP.  A Fixed Price modification to the sole source Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract awarded June 2017 to complete USAF and initiate USA Total Package Fielding (TPF).  Another Fixed Price modification will be awarded to the LRIP contract in September 2018.  A competitive production contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Production CLINs will be pursued for Full Rate Production (FRP).  The Full Rate Production (FRP) contract will also include Cost Plus CLINS for the vendor to establish a production line at Pine Bluff Arsenal.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK STRATEGIC AIRCRAFT (JSAM SA)

The JSAM SA acquisition approach involves modifying the fielded M53 ground mask design in order to add Pressure Breathing for Altitude (PBA), up to 40,000 feet above sea-level, and middle ear equalization capabilities.  The JSAM SA mask is intended to be fielded to the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), and United States Army (USA).  The Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) contract was awarded via sole source to Avon Protection Systems, Cadillac, Michigan to modify and field a commercially available mask (M53).

The overall acquisition strategy is to produce and field the JSAM SA masks incrementally.  This approach allows the JSAM SA mask to be fielded to aircrew of the most applicable aircrafts in the shortest amount of time.  At the end of all increments, the Services will have achieved their Full Operating Capability (FOC).  The first increment will consist of fielding the JSAM SA mask to the USAF E-3 and USN P-8 aircrew.  Based on technical difficulty and mission need, the JSAM SA program will work with the Services to determine which aircraft will be addressed in subsequent increments.

The overall test strategy involves four major phases.  The first test phase consists of Design Verification Testing (DVT) which will evaluate developmental prototype masks prior to Critical Design Review (CDR).  The second test phase is Developmental Testing (DT) to support Milestone C/LRIP.  The third test phase is Operational Testing (OT) of assets to support Initial Operating Capability (IOC) fielding to USAF E-3, USN P-8, and USA MC-12 aircrew.  The final test phase will consist of Integration and Airworthiness Certification (I&amp;AC) testing for all remaining aircraft.

The contract strategy consists of two sole-source contracts with Avon Protection Systems, the manufacturer of the fielded M53 mask.  The first contract, which was awarded on 31 July 2013, covers all activities during the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase to include all LRIP builds.  The second contract, which is planned to be awarded after Milestone C, will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment (PD) phase including all FRP builds.

JOINT SERVICE AIRCREW MASK TACTICAL AIRCRAFT (JSAM TA)

The JSAM TA acquisition approach involves modifying the USN/USMC fielded A/P22P-14A series respirator design to meet aircraft integration requirements.  The test strategy involves integrated testing (combined DT/OT) to be completed prior to MS C/FRP.  The contract strategy consists of two sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts with Cam Lock, Ltd., Aldershot Hampshire, United Kingdom.  The first contract, awarded September 2016, covers all activities during the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase.  The second contract will be a sole source FFP Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) and is planned for award after the Milestone C/FRP.  The second contract will cover the activities during the Production and Deployment phase including Full Rate Production (FRP) builds.  The JSAM TA mask is intended to be fielded to the USAF, USN, and USMC.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE (UIPE)

Reference UIPE FOS acquisition strategy.

CBRN UNIFORM INTEGRATED PROTECTION ENSEMBLE FAMILY OF SYSTEMS (UIPE FOS)

The UIPE FoS will develop a family of systems that will provide the Warfighter percutaneous protection from operationally relevant traditional and non-traditional CBRN threats.  The family of systems will be developed based on Service mission profiles (Land, Sea, Air and Homeland Defense) with the goal being to minimize operational burden and provide improved form, fit, function, and integration with the current Warfighter kits compared to legacy systems.  An Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracting approach will be used to procure informational white papers during the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, prototypes, and test articles of possible solutions.  The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program.  Procurement will be through either the OTA or a more traditional contracting vehicle.  UIPE FoS and the Services identified a mature solution that may meet Air Mission Area suit requirements. The program will identify data gaps from the United States Air Force's (USAF) test and evaluation of the Chemical, Biological, Radiological Layer (CBRL) of the Integrated Aircrew Ensemble. There is high confidence in the CBRL meeting the requirements for the Services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

CBRN IS will support the implementation and integration of Integrated Early Warning (IEW) capabilities that allow users to access netted sensor information, data fusion, disease modeling, biosurveillance data, source term estimation data, incident management tools, and planning and analysis capabilities.  CBRN IS will expand cloud-based capability to Korean Peninsula and other Areas of Responsibility, as required.  Additionally, it will continue to expand and provide the environment, net centric, cloud based tools and capabilities that are aligned with the current and future DoD IT/Cyber computing environments including Army Common Operating Environment (COE) and the Joint Information Environment (JIE).  This will be integrated into a collaborative environment that allows users to collect and disseminate CBRN warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time.
G-BSP will conduct Developmental and Operational Testing, and develop both a SIPR version and an International version of G-BSP. This will be integrated into a web-based enterprise environment that facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological hazards. This will result in a set of tools and capabilities that facilitate the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations. 

JEM 2 will continue to develop, integrate, and test emerging capability defined in Requirements Definition Package 4. JEM 2 will continue to conduct user feedback events to ensure capability aligns with warfighter needs and perform independent operational test and evaluation to verify operation of the JEM 2 software in service command and control environments. This will be integrated into a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. This will provide warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects. Additionally, this will support planning efforts to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects integrated into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

JWARN 2 will to continue develop, integrate, and test emerging capability defined in Requirements Definition Packages 1 and 2 and integrate CBRN sensor/detector data/input with JWARN software baseline. JWARN 2 will continue to coordinate with operational forces for User Feedback Events, improving user interface and creating more efficient operational experience and conduct Multiservice Operational Test and Evaluation to verify operation of the JWARN 2 software in service command and control environments. This will be integrated into an accredited DoD warning and reporting system that enables an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN and TIM incidents. This will provide a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the COP, displayed through Service provided C4I systems resident at all echelons of command. Commanders will be provided with enhanced situational awareness throughout the area of operation, supports warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.

As software-intensive systems, JEM 2, JWARN 2, and G-BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components; unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.

The SSA will provide support for the development and integration of Joint Service solutions for Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (IA), Integrated Architectures, Data Management/Modeling, Interoperability Certifications, Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&amp;A) to support interoperable and integrated net-centric, service-oriented solutions for CBRN systems.  The SSA  develops reference implementations to guide Government and industry system and software developers to ensure that their products meet common interoperability standards.  The latest technologies/products include the definition of a Common CBRN Sensor Integration Standard (CCSI) and the CBRN Data Model.  These technologies are direct enablers for the development of CBRN integrated sensor networks and the dissemination of CBRN information across all users.  The SSA directly supports Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) initiatives by providing common service oriented architectures and frameworks for the collection and dissemination of Bio-Surveillance and other critical CBRN information. This will provide the Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Global-Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014. The Global-BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development. The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach. IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event. Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs). There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016. A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20. The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN-IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple programs of record capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment.  CBRN-IS enterprise will initially integrate appropriate JPEO-CBD products into a FoS framework beginning with the Joint Warning and Reporting (JWARN) and Joint Effects Model (JEM) program capabilities.  CBRN-IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense.  The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating the inclusion of mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing ATD and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD).  CBRN-IS utilizes the Agile software development process with the IT Box acquisition strategy to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM 2 integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM 1 and 2 development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN 2 Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2, Northrup Grumman, will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN 2 integrator, a follow-on contract was awarded in December 2018.  The follow-on contractor, DCS Corp, for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JWARN contract.  The JWARN 2 follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN 2 software development and maintenance contract.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Low Rate Initial Production (EMD/LRIP) of medical countermeasures, development of reagents, assays, diagnostic equipment, biosurveillance and supporting efforts.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Medical Countermeasure Platform Technologies (MCMPT)
(2) Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC)
(3) Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) facility
(4) Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B)
(5) Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS)
(6) Defense Biological Products Assurance Program (DBPAP)
(7) Antiviral Therapeutic Program (AV TX)
(8) Botulinum Vaccine (VAC BOT)
(9) Antiviral Prophylaxis Studies (Congressional Interest Item)
(10) Next Generation Anthrax Vaccine (VAC NGA) 
(11) Plague Vaccine (VAC PLG)
(12) Special Immunizations Program (VAC SIP)

The MCMPT will leverage platform technologies to streamline and accelerate the MCM delivery to the Force by reducing developmental risk. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats.  The first platform being established as part of an Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is the Advanced Development and Manufacturing Antibody Technologies (ADAMANT).  A second platform technology will be established which will focus on a vaccine platform capability.  The Agile Medical Paradigm (AMP) is the CBDP's strategic framework to accelerate the delivery of MCMs.  To achieve this goal the DOD is establishing a MCMPT capability.  The goal of the MCMPT is to counter a variety of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will center on leveraging the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and developing robust manufacturing processes.  

The JMEDICC is a collaboration between United States and Ugandan research and outbreak response entities intended to enable clinical trials for filovirus (Ebola and Marburg) therapeutics during an outbreak. The JMEDICC effort provides a platform of advanced supportive care, scientific rigor, laboratory and logistical capacity, mobility, and rapid response to test new therapeutics or MCM in a filovirus outbreak setting. The JMEDICC effort is a project currently under the Antiviral Therapeutic Program (AV TX) whose resulting capability offers a mechanism to greatly accelerate the development of life-saving products for future outbreaks.

The capability building effort at the DoD ADM will establish and enhance proven biopharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing technologies to accelerate the delivery of medical countermeasures as part of a medical integrated layered defense.  The return on investment is an increased level of preparedness and responsiveness to counter current and emerging chemical and biological threats. By establishing and enhancing proven enabling technologies, the DoD ADM will accelerate development of MCMs at all stages of development, enhance preparedness for existing threats, and accelerate response to emerging threats.  MCMs impacted by these efforts include: Vaccines for Viral Agents, Vaccines for Bacterial Agents and Toxins, Monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody conjugates for therapeutic and prophylactic use across all agent classes, and Adjuvants.  Funds to support the state of readiness were previously provided through individual product development and manufacturing funding lines.  In FY20 the Department is providing dedicated funds to support operational availability.

The CMDR-B program develops medical countermeasures (MCMs) for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate drug was approved by  the FDA in Oct 18 for Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CAPB) that was required as part of the acquisition strategy for the antibiotic repurposing program from S&amp;T to advanced development. 

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied CBR threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and FDA-cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS Inc 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease IVD assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests. NGDS 2 will complement NGDS Increment 1 by developing diagnostics for unmet biological pathogen and toxin threats, chemical and radiological exposures, and to provide capability to lower echelons of care. NGDS 2 will provide additional capability for diagnosis of CBR-induced diseases, suitable for use in far forward environments, by developing lightweight, portable, and simple-to-use instruments and test kits. 

The DBPAP strategy establishes a core research and development capability by developing biological threat agent reference materials (strains, antigens, antibodies and nucleic acids) and detection/diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection.  These reagents/assays are leveraged across multiple programs to meet the requirements of the Warfighter and Joint biological defense systems and support the biological defense community.  Through the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative, the DBPAP will use a systematic approach to the introduction of new materials and information into MCM development. This includes advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility.

The AV TX will develop and deliver FDA approved antiviral therapeutics for the warfighter.  Initial drug product will be developed targeting Ebola Virus Disease. Development of models to test for alphavirus therapeutics are also in work. Other pathogens on the biological warfare threat lists, including viruses of interest from Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae, are targets of future interest. Developed antiviral therapeutics will be employed after suspected or confirmed exposure to the relevant threat agents and AV TX MCMs will ameliorate the effect of threat agents to the warfighter.  In the event of a natural occurring outbreak, antiviral therapeutics can be provided to ensure freedom of operation. 

The DoD provides for the development of vaccines that are directed against validated biological warfare (BW) weapons to include bacteria, viruses, and toxins of biological origin.  Effective medical countermeasures are urgently needed to negate the threat of these BW agents.  Vaccines have been identified as the most efficient countermeasure against the validated threat of BW weapons.  Products under development in this budget item include Recombinant Botulinum A/B and Plaguevaccines.  Efforts to be conducted during the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase include the development of large scale manufacturing process and validation of that process, nonclinical studies, demonstration of manufacturing consistency, and expanded clinical human safety studies.  The results of these efforts, and those conducted during the EMD phase, will be used to submit a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for product licensure.  To evaluate vaccine effectiveness, pivotal animal studies will be conducted concurrently with the Phase 3 clinical trial to satisfy the requirements of the FDA's "Animal Rule".  The DoD anticipates that the FDA will approve these products for the Recombinant Botulinum A/B, Plague, and Next Generation Anthrax vaccine programs using the Animal Rule, which allows for the demonstration of efficacy in relevant animal model(s).  Upon FDA licensure, the product will transition to full-scale licensed production.

The DoD also has the mission to maintain Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) storage and to conduct the periodic potency and sterility testing of these materials to support submissions to the FDA.  These IND vaccines will be used to provide additional levels of protection to laboratory workers in the SIP conducting research on these diseases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MCM PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES (MCMPT)

The goal of the MCMPT is to rapidly counter a broad-spectrum of threat agents using standardized discovery, design, manufacturing, and testing processes to reduce the MCM development risks.  Efforts will focus on establishing advanced platform technologies within the DoD's Advanced Development Manufacturing (ADM) facility and evaluating that capability through nonclinical and clinical testing. A subset of these technologies will be adapted to deliver a rapid response capability to novel and emerging threats. Once established, future programs will be able to leverage these platforms for the development of future medical countermeasures.  It is anticipated that these efforts will leverage the Other Transactions Authority (OTA) through the medical OTA consortium.

JOINT MOBILE EMERGING DISEASE INTERVENTION CLINICAL CAPABILITY (JMEDICC)

The Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC) is a collaboration between United States and Ugandan research and outbreak response entities. It currently is a joint effort with The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and The Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) to enable clinical trials for filovirus (i.e., Ebola and Marburg) therapeutics during an outbreak. Prior to Fiscal Year 2020, this effort was funded under the Antiviral Therapeutics (AV TX) Program. The JMEDICC effort is currently focused on filovirus, but is an adaptable capability that can incorporate multiple different medical countermeasures (MCM) in parallel and accommodate multiple site activities. This will maximize JMEDICC's current response capability and infrastructure by expanding as the endemic situation warrants. A cost sharing plan is currently being explored with other government and nongovernment agencies to determine interest and relevance levels. Antiviral Therapeutics program funded JMEDICC effort through FY19.

ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT &amp; MANUFACTURING (ADM)

A contract was awarded to Ology Bioservices on 20 March 2013 (then Nanotherapeutics, Inc.) to establish a Department of Defense (DoD) ADM Facility to rapidly develop, approve (through FDA approval), and manufacture MCMs.  The contract was structured to be executed in two (2) phases:

Phase 1-Establish, commission and validate (facility(ies)/ equipment) for two (2) advanced development and manufacturing suites that use agile, flexible (single use, disposable), modular and multi-product technologies for MCM advanced development and manufacturing. Both suites must meet Biological Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) standards.  Phase 1 was completed on 31 March 2017.

Phase 2-Support and maintain that capability in a state of readiness to support MCM development (under the animal rule as applicable) and manufacturing and assist in training personnel in its use. This includes transition and integration of new technologies, from Pre-Investigational New Drug Application phase with readiness to support simultaneous operations, through FDA licensure.  The first option is scheduled for completion in 2QFY19, proceeded by a second, 2-year option.

COUNTERMEASURES FOR DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA (CMDR-B)

The CMDR-B program develops MCMs for Service members for protection against MDR bacteria, including Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) and organisms that are genetically modified to be MDR and resulting bio-toxins.  The resulting product(s) will be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to prevent or minimize effects of MDR bacterial exposures. The candidate is a transitional product from S&amp;T that showed efficacy against plague, anthrax, and other BW agents. The regulatory approach of the program is to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule. The program will conduct non-human primate studies to initial efficacy. The performer will submit Supplemental New Drug Application for the therapeutic during the EMD Phase. In FY18 PK study on non-human primates was completed for the plague indication. MS B for the program is planned for 4QFY20.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and COEs that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address. More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care. NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings.

DEFENSE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS ASSURANCE PROGRAM (DBPAP)

The Defense Biological Products Assurance Program's (DBPAP) strategy establishes a core research and development capability to develop biological threat agent reference materials (antigens, nucleic acids, and antibodies) as well as detection and diagnostic assays for biothreat agent detection that shall be used across multiple detection and diagnostic platforms.  In addition, this strategy includes a formal, validated advanced development process for transitioning new assays into production and subsequent integration with the appropriate detection/diagnostic platform.

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPEUTICS (AV TX)

The Anti-viral Therapeutics program acquisition strategy supports the development of multiple therapeutics through the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase against the Ebola (Zaire), Marburg, Sudan and alpha virus bio warfare threats.  The initial therapeutic candidate is for the Ebola Zaire that is scheduled for a Milestone B decision review in FY19.  The overall regulatory approach of the program remains to pursue development of products to FDA approval under the Animal Rule.  The program will conduct pilot and pivotal animal efficacy, and toxicology studies for FDA approval.  The acquisition strategy for each indication will have the performers submitting New Drug applications for the therapeutics during the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phases.

BOTULINUM VACCINE (VAC BOT)

The Prime System Contractor (Dynport Vaccine Company/DVC LLC, Frederick MD) will function as the FDA regulatory sponsor and will perform all ancillary, regulatory, quality assurance, and data management as required by the FDA.  The current budget supports development through FDA licensure of a recombinant bivalent (A and B) botulinum vaccine.  Other serotypes will be developed through an evolutionary approach, as funding becomes available.  The Advanced Component Development and Prototypes (ACD&amp;P) phase included the manufacture of candidate current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) lots, animal safety testing, and initial clinical trials.  During this phase, the vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a small human clinical trial (Phase 1).  During the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase, the prime contractor stabilized the vaccine formulation, validated the manufacturing process and testing protocols, optimized the delivery systems and manufactured consistency lots.  Phase 2 clinical trials were performed and provided additional safety data.  The evaluation of efficacy in pivotal animal studies to satisfy FDA requirements for the Animal Rule has been completed.  The remaining efforts to be conducted during the EMD phase include the Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety in an expanded volunteer population.  The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision will be conducted after the manufacturing process has been validated and consistency lots have been produced.  A Biologics License Application (BLA) is be submitted to the FDA including all clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing data.  The FDA grants licensure to products that are determined to be safe and efficacious.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports efforts in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of the acquisition strategy for prophylactic, pre-treatment, and therapeutic drugs and diagnostic medical devices for the protection, treatment, detection, and medical management of chemical warfare agent exposures.  This project provides for the research and development of safety studies, manufacturing scale-up, process validation, drug interaction, performance test, and submission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug licensure application(s).  

Efforts included in the project are:
(1) Emerging Threats (EMRT) 
(2) Alternative Autoinjector (AUTOINJ)
(3) Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS)
(4) Bioscavenger - Plasma (BSCAV-P) 
(5) The Improved Nerve Agent Treatment System (INATS) 

The EMRT program is now referred to as the Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS) and is specifically supporting the discovery, characterization, development, and fielding of FDA-approved therapeutic MCMs to protect the Joint Service warfighter against operational exposures to the opioid class of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), a high priority.  The first increment of the ROCS program will develop a naloxone autoinjector as a rescue treatment that will counteract the adverse effects from exposure to opioids.

AUTOINJ consists of investigating an FDA approved alternative source(s), beyond the single current DoD source, for autoinjectors that deliver DoD nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the warfighter; mitigates capability fielding and operational readiness risks.  This resulted from the manufacturing and quality issues for the fielded ATNAA product, the oxime (2-PAM) and atropine in a dual chambered autoinjector.  

The AAS consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

The BSCAV-P is a new capability, to be used as a prophylaxis against nerve agents.

INATS advanced development provides an enhanced capability treatment regimen offering greater protection over a broader spectrum of toxic nerve agent threats.  Components of the development effort include (1) a new and improved oxime (replacing 2-pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) to treat current and emerging threats and 2) the insertion of a Centrally-Acting (CA) anticholinergic agent to the treatment regimen to increase survivability and decrease morbidity.  Based on recent guidance from the FDA there is no longer a need to expand the pretreatment indications for pyridostigmine bromide beyond the nerve agent soman.  Therefore, the Joint Project Manager for Chemical Defense Pharmaceuticals (JPdM CDP) will execute nonclinical studies to demonstrate the safety of pyridostigmine bromide when used as a pretreatment should agents other than soman be encountered.  This is no longer a BA5 but BA7 work effort.  The INATS treatment regimen both improves the performance of, and eventually replaces the Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto-injector (ATNAA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>RAPID OPIOID COUNTERMEASURE SYSTEM (ROCS)

The Emerging Threats program is now called the Rapid Opioid Countermeasure System (ROCS). The ROCS program is considering existing naloxone autoinjector capabilities identified from focused Market Research and Small Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) information to rapidly transition a candidate into advanced development and future production and fielding. ROCS is also considering, with the joint service users, an accelerated requirements and acquisition structure. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) Agreements will be utilized to the extent possible in the development.

ALTERNATE AUTOINJECTOR MANUFACTURER CAPABILITY (AUTOINJ)

The Alternative Autoinjector Investigation will identify an alternative source(s) to develop, and provide required and FDA approved autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidote and treatment capabilities to the services.  Currently, a single DoD source provides all of these capabilities.  That single source is experiencing manufacturing and quality issues leading to risk that the services may not meet their operational requirements.  This effort leverages previous work begun under the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS) autoinjector-delivered product wherein the single manufacturer notified the AAS program office that the FDA had noted manufacturing and quality issues which impacted the AAS program as well as all other DoD autoinjector-delivered nerve agent antidotes and treatments.  At that time, the AAS program began investigating alternative sources through the release of a RFI.  Subsequent to the RFI, the AAS program awarded a task order under an existing IDIQ contract vehicle to begin the identification efforts.  As this issue is well beyond the scope of the AAS program and impacts all developmental and fielded autoinjector-delivered capabilities, the Joint Program Executive Office, Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) approved the strategy to expand the alternative autoinjector effort beyond AAS, thus initiating a new effort benefiting both fielded and developmental capabilities.  The JPEO-CBD also approved the management and oversight of the effort via a series of In-Process Reviews (IPRs).  The effort will proceed through the submission of a New Drug Application and will culminate with FDA approval of an alternative autoinjector source(s).

ADVANCED ANTICONVULSANT SYSTEM (AAS)

The Advanced Anticonvulsant System, consists of Midazolam in an autoinjector for treatment of nerve agent induced seizures.  Midazolam, injected intramuscularly, will treat traditional nerve agent and non-traditional nerve agent-induced seizures and prevent subsequent neurological damage.  Midazolam is more water-soluble than diazepam (the currently fielded medication to control nerve agent-induced seizures) and terminates nerve agent-induced seizures more quickly than diazepam.  AAS will not eliminate the need for other protective and therapeutic systems.

A contractor shall be responsible for conducting activities associated with drug development in a manner consistent with eventual approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The contractor shall sponsor the drug to the FDA and hold all approvals and/or licenses.  During the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, large scale manufacturing, Phase 2 human clinical safety studies and definitive animal efficacy studies will be conducted.  FDA approval of the countermeasure is an exit criterion for the SDD phase.  During the Production and Deployment Phase, sufficient quantities of product to meet Initial Operational Capability will be purchased.  Subsequent purchases will be made by the Defense Logistics Agency.  Any post-marketing surveillance requested by the FDA will be the responsibility of the contractor.

BIOSCAVENGER (BSCAV)

The Bioscavenger program employed a serial evaluation of candidates to achieve competitive prototyping in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TM&amp;RR) phase, culminating in a down-select decision. The Bioscavenger program then issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to select the best value for the government for a prophylaxis to support an initial limited user group. During the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase, the program continued to meet its performance objectives and produced a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) drug product for use in further development. The program will end current licensure activity in FY20.  In FY20, the program will obtain the technical data package and intellectual property from the contractor in order to continue future development of the same or similar product.  The program will continue with the ongoing collaborations with the international partners under the Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Memorandum of Understanding (CBR-MOU) to develop a treatment indication for Bioscavenger. The Bioscavenger program will also conduct an analysis of alternative manufacturing technologies, continue to evaluate alternative candidates, and monitor technologies that may lead to a full force solution.

IMPROVED NERVE AGENT TREATMENT SYSTEM (INATS)

Oxime Component - The development of a new and improved oxime, MMB4, (replacing 2-PAM) to treat current and emerging nerve agent threats, is one component of the INATS Development Program. Both the oxime and the centrally acting components are required to address the current and emerging nerve agent threat and to mitigate their effects. MMB4 is a relatively new chemical entity transitioning from Science and Technology Development. MMB4 requires the conduct of studies to resume the Phase 1 Clinical Trial, preparation for the Phase 2 clinical trials, the manufacturing of the drug product for both these trials, the conduct of non-clinical studies to determine toxicity, and the conduct of premonitory studies to determine the impact of nerve transmissions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project identifies critical test capabilities, planning, and infrastructure improvements/modifications necessary to evaluate CBRN Defense systems in realistic operating environments.

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Product Director, Test, Equipment, Strategy, and Support (PD TESS)
(2) Chemical Biological Material Assessment Infrastructure (CBMAI)

PD TESS and CBMAI determine test infrastructure needs across the Chemical Biological Defense Portfolio (CBDP) and prioritizes RDT&amp;E resources to support test planning and schedules/milestones for programs of record.  Infrastructure improvements, modifications, or new development provide critical test capabilities for chemical, biological, and emerging threat products.  CBMAI conducts studies and prototyping to enable rapid integration to support testing of detection, protection, and decontamination equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this PE support Joint Doctrine and Training, sustains the technical test capability at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), sustains the core DoD CB S&amp;T laboratory infrastructure, provides for program and financial management support, and supports the Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analysis program.

Individual projects include:
-   Joint Doctrine and Training Support (DT6): development of Joint Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for developing CB defense systems.  This project also supports CB modeling and simulation to support the Warfighter.

- Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) (DW6): operating support to WDTC and Bio-Test Branch (ECBC) for the required institutional test operating costs (e.g. institutional civilian and contractor labor; repair and maintenance of test instrumentation, equipment, and facilities; and replacement of test equipment).

- Laboratory Support (LS6): operating support for sustainment and modernization efforts for surety laboratory infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance DoD infrastructure capabilities to counter an expanding threat space, exploit advances in technology; and develop and transition CB defense equipment and countermeasures to the Warfighter.

- RDT&amp;E Management (MS6): management support for the DoD CBDP to allow program overview and integration of overall medical and non-medical programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)), through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical Biological Defense (DASD(CBD)).

- Joint Concepts, Studies, and Analyses (O49): plan, conduct, evaluate, and report on Joint tests (for other than developmental hardware) and accomplishment of operational research assessments in support of requirements received from the Services and the Combatant Commanders for already fielded equipment and systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides the technical and operational capability for testing Department of Defense (DoD) Chemical and Biological (CB) and Non Traditional Agent (NTA) defense materiel, equipment, and systems from concept through production to include associated special operations Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Development (TTPD) activities at West Desert Test Center (WDTC), and the Biological Test Branch of the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (BTB-ECBC), both part of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) located at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG).  Project provides overhead (institutional) funding required to operate WDTC and BTB-ECBC in compliance with Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY03 (Public Law 107-314 - December 2002).

WDTC and BTB-ECBC are the reliance centers for all DoD CB defense testing and provide the United States' only combined range, chamber, toxic chemical lab, and bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) test facility.  Total institutional test operating costs are to be provided by the OSD Chemical and Biological Defense Program IAW Program Budget Decision 250 (1996).

WDTC and BTB-ECBC use state-of-the-art chemical and life-sciences test facilities and test chambers to perform CB defense testing of protective gear, decontamination systems, detectors, equipment, and non-materiel CB defense solutions while maintaining safety, security, and surety of chemical agents and biological pathogens.  WDTC also provides test ranges, to include fully instrumented outdoor ranges, for TTPD activities and testing with simulants that can be correlated to the laboratory testing with live agents to ensure reliable and repeatable data are generated to support acquisition decisions of CB defense equipment.

The Secretary of the Army has been directed to conduct additional research addressing existing gaps in scientific knowledge encompassing the Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Program.  The transition of the Bio-Testing Branch (BTB) to ECBC will enable the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program to meet end to end enterprise tracking, reporting, and auditability requirements within an approved Governance, Risks, and Compliance framework.  The laboratory commanders and directors are best able to identify potential risk through the use of local risk assessments and are responsible to promote cultures of safety and responsibility.  Direct liaison with and oversight by the Executive Agent Responsible Officer will ensure laboratory directors or the MRTFB commander are empowered and supported in their operational environment.  The ultimate responsibility for the safe and secure receipt, storage, handling, shipment and transfer of BSAT resides with the laboratory director or the MRTFB commander in accordance with Army, Navy, Air Force, and Federal policies and regulations.  The implementation of a structured BSAT Biosafety Program includes clear standards and procedures, policy and regulations, peer review, quality control, accountability and oversight, adequate resources and infrastructure, and continuous process improvement.  Through these means employees and members of the public are protected against the hazards associated with BSAT.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides management support for the DoD Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP).  It includes program oversight and integration of overall non-CBRN Defense Equipment (non-CDE) and CBRN Defense Equipment (CDE) programs by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs (ASD(NCB)) and defense programs through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense (DASD(CBD)).  Funds execution management is provided by Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). 

The project also provides for the development, coordination and integration of Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defense capability requirements, including assistance and support to the Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Services to improve CBRN defense related doctrine, education, training, and awareness by the Joint Requirements Office (JRO); preparation of Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) documents in accordance with Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction CJCSI 3170.01I dated 23 January 2015; Joint CBRN Defense Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) planning; input to the CBD Annual Report to Congress; and program guidance development by the Program Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO).

The Biological Select Agent and Toxin (BSAT) Biosafety Program Office (BBPO) will advise the Executive Agent Responsible Official (EA RO) for the DoD BSAT Biosafety Program on biosafety and all matters that pertain to risk associated with BSAT operations, provide oversight of DoD BSAT laboratory biosafety operations, serve as a unified DoD interface with external regulatory agencies, ensure safety and standardization of procedures used in DoD BSAT laboratories, and identify industry-wide best practices to enhance biosafety across the full spectrum of DoD BSAT operations.  As the EA RO for BSAT the program is tasked with technical review, inspection, and harmonization of biosafety protocols and procedures across DoD laboratories that handle BSAT.  As such, the program manages the Biosafety and Scientific Review Panel, inspection of DoD laboratories, harmonization of DoD BSAT-related regulations and procedures, coordinating interaction and information with the CDC, establishing a Defense Business System to track and manage BSAT across DoD, providing laboratory biosafety oversight, and advancing BSAT-related scientific research to address knowledge gaps.  A portion of the funding line transitions to BSAT Research Support starting in FY20 to support the Scientific Gaps in Biorisk Research Program (SGBRP) to address gaps in scientific knowledge pertaining to biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) biosafety and biosecurity.  Closing these gaps will reduce the inherent risks associated with BSAT research in CBDP laboratories and supports research and development work on priority agents.

The project includes programming support for the Joint Service CB Information System (JSCBIS) which serves as a budgetary and informational database for the DoD CBDP.  Also included within the project is financial management services to include fund distribution, execution reporting, and fiscal financial statements.

This project also supports the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (CBRND) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive, who is responsible for the planning, balancing, and oversight of test infrastructure and test technology requirements to support Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) of DoD CBRND systems, as outlined in the RDA Plan.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the Enterprise processes to develop and sustain standardized T&amp;E methodologies and validated instrumentation and infrastructure to ensure the adequacy of test for CBRND systems in alignment with acquisition milestones and associated decision points.  The Joint Test Infrastructure Working Group (JTIWG) program supports T&amp;E Early Involvement; test threat planning; T&amp;E studies; and T&amp;E standards planning and development to support CBRND testing for all Services to include medical T&amp;E efforts.  

The CBRND T&amp;E Executive directly supports OSD T&amp;E oversight of acquisition programs and provides the mechanism for early T&amp;E involvement in the acquisition process.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive provides the T&amp;E infrastructure investment strategy and coordinates investment planning and T&amp;E capabilities validation among the Joint Service Community to ensure that program needs are met.  The CBRND T&amp;E Executive oversees the T&amp;E processes to ensure end to end feedback loops to support to the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR Program is a Congressionally mandated program established to increase the participation of small business in federal research and development (R&amp;D).  Currently, each participating Government agency must reserve 2.5% of its extramural R&amp;D for SBIR awards to competing small businesses.  The goal of the SBIR Program is to invest in the innovative capabilities of the small business community to help meet Government R&amp;D objectives while allowing small companies to develop technologies and products which they can then commercialize through sales back to the Government or in the private sector.

The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program like SBIR, is a Government-wide program, mandated by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992, PL 102-564.  STTR was established in FY94 as a three-year pilot program.  In early 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a comprehensive review of the Government-wide STTR Program to determine the effectiveness of the pilot program.  Upon review of the GAO report, Congress voted to reauthorize the STTR Program to the year 2000, consistent with the authorization period for the SBIR Program.

STTR was established as a companion program to the SBIR Program and is executed in essentially the same manner; however, there are several distinct differences.  The STTR Program provides a mechanism for participation by university, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and other non-profit research institutions.  Specifically, the STTR Program is designed to provide an incentive for small companies and research at academic institutions and non-profit research and development institutions to work together to move emerging technical ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace to foster high-tech economic development and to advance U.S. economic competitiveness.  Each STTR proposal must be submitted by a team which includes a small business (as the prime contractor for contracting purposes) and at least one research institution, which have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for the purposes of the STTR effort.  Furthermore, the project must be divided up such that the small business performs at least 40% of the work and the research institution(s) performs at least 30% of the work.  The remainder of the work may be performed by either party or a third party.  The budget is separate from the SBIR budget and is significantly smaller (0.15% of the extramural R&amp;D budget vs.  2.5% for the SBIR Program).

The DoD has consolidated management and oversight of the CBDP into a single office within the OSD.  The Army was designated as the Executive Agent for coordination and integration of the Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD) program.  The executive agent for the SBIR/STTR portion of the program is the Army Research Office-Washington.

The overall objective of the CBD SBIR/STTR program is to improve the transition or transfer of innovative CBD technologies between DoD components and the private sector for mutual benefit.  The CBD program includes those technology efforts that maximize a strong defensive posture in a biological or chemical environment using passive and active means as deterrents.  These technologies include chemical and biological detection; information assessment, which includes identification, modeling, and intelligence; contamination avoidance; and protection of both individual soldiers and equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The projects in this PE support efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production in order to maintain Joint Force readiness. 

Individual projects include:
- Contamination Avoidance (CA7): technology upgrade and refresh of fielded dismounted reconnaissance and detection systems that minimize chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination and prevent further cross-contamination during operations.

- Homeland Defense (CM7): technology refresh of fielded analytical laboratory system capabilities to conduct on-site analysis of any unknown sample and test potential life-threatening substances.

- Collective Protection (CO7): technology upgrade and refresh of fielded collective protection systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in spaces safe from the effects of CBR contamination.

- Decontamination Systems (DE7): technology refresh of fielded Contamination Mitigation (ConMit) systems that will remove and/or detoxify contaminated material without damaging combat equipment, personnel, or the environment.

- Individual Protection (IP7): technology refresh of fielded individual protective equipment which enable the Joint Force to operate in a contaminated CBR environment with little or no degradation to his/her performance.  

- Information Systems (IS7): technology refresh of fielded information systems that shape the battlespace against CBR threats.

- Medical Biological Defense (MB7): technology refresh of fielded medical diagnostic systems and associated capabilities (e.g., assays) that contribute to the layered medical defenses against biological warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.

- Medical Chemical Defense (MC7): technology upgrade of fielded medical nerve agent treatment system that contribute to the layered medical defenses against chemical warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.  

- Test and Evaluation (TE7): technology upgrades and revitalization of fielded test capabilities and infrastructure at Dugway Proving Ground necessary to evaluate CBRN Defense systems in realistic operating environments.

The projects in this PE support operational systems development necessary to maintain operational effectiveness and are therefore correctly placed in Budget Activity 7.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project supports technology upgrade and refresh of fielded dismounted reconnaissance and detection systems that minimize chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination and prevent further cross-contamination during operations.
 
Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) Solid Liquid Adapter (SLA)
(2) CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) 

The JCAD SLA kit effort continues the development of the JCAD Chemical Explosive Detector (CED), which was an NGCD acceleration effort for USSOCOM. The SLA interfaces with the fielded M4A1 JCAD to allow for solid liquid sampling of surfaces. The SLA kit provides an interim point solution to detect Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs) and Pharmaceutical Based Agents (PBAs) off surfaces as the since the Proximate Chemical Agent Detector (PCAD) program is delayed due to immature non- contact technology. In FY20, JCAD will continue the JCAD SLA Contract to verify production readiness for testing.

The CBRN DRS consists of portable, commercial and Government off-the-shelf equipment which provides personnel protection from current and emerging CBRN hazards through detection, identification, sample collection, decontamination, marking, and hazard reporting for CBRN and emerging threats.  This project provides the technology upgrade and refresh effort for the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) to address and mitigate technology/equipment obsolescence.  Experimentation and demonstration will be used in this phase to reduce risk and inform supporting materiel solutions, CONOPS and TTPs. This project provides the technology upgrade and refresh effort for the CBRN DRS supports Dismounted Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and CBRN Sensitive Site Assessment missions which enables more detailed and near real-time CBRN information flow for the Warfighter. In FY20 funding will be used to assess, test, and integrate updated capabilities identified in prior efforts focusing on protective ensembles.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>CBRN DISMOUNTED RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS

The Chemical Biological Radiological Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems (CBRN DRS) program uses a GOTS/COTS non-developmental item (NDI) single step acquisition approach to a full capability. This strategy employs an NDI acquisition concept to establish a simplified management framework to translate mission needs and emerging technology capabilities into a stable, affordable, well-managed acquisition program. Capability sets will be identified as engineering change proposals to the base kit, produced and fielded in accordance with priorities and needs of the Services.  Multiple kits will be identified based on readiness for integration throughout the life of the program. CBRN DRS systems will be produced using a workshare approach between Organic assets and Contractor production facilities.

JOINT CHEMICAL AGENT DETECTOR (JCAD)

The JCAD SLA is a developmental effort to expand existing JCAD capabilities to include NTA, explosive and opioid capability. Upon successful evaluation and product integration efforts, the JCAD SLA will be integrated with one of the planned CBRN DRS Advanced Capabilities Sets via engineering change proposal. The JCAD SLA kit will be an Additional Authorized List (AAL) item to the M4A1 JCAD.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports technology refresh of fielded analytical laboratory system capabilities to conduct on-site analysis of any unknown sample and test potential life-threatening substances.

Efforts included in this Project are:
(1) Common Analytical Laboratory System (CALS) and Analytical Laboratory System Modification (ALS MOD)
(2) Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team (WMD CST)

The CALS / ALS MOD effort supports the evaluation of analytical components for technical refreshment and upgrades of key components of the CALS and ALS MOD systems that have become obsolete, or are no longer being supported by the manufacturer. This allows the CALS and ALS MOD users to maintain their operational capability and operational effectiveness.

WMD-CST supports the fielded system upgrade and ongoing assessment and acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) analytical detection, protection, decontamination and sampling equipment for survey in order to expand/enhance the operational capabilities of the (57) WMD CST Teams.  Efforts in the program element support upgrades of key components of the WMD CST Program that have become obsolete, or are no longer being supported by the manufacturer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for technology upgrade and refresh of fielded Collective Protection (CP) equipment and systems that are smaller, lighter, less costly to produce and maintain, and more logistically supportable enabling mission accomplishment in spaces safe from the effects of chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination.

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Modernization Protection (MODPROT) 
(2) Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection (JECP)

MODPROT CP provides upgrades, improvements and modernizations to fielded Collective Protection Systems such as the Chemical and Biological Protective Shelter, Shipboard Collective Protection Systems, Fixed Site Collective Protection Systems, M20A1 Simplified Collective Protection Equipment, Modular Collective Protection Equipment systems, and Collectively Protected Field Hospitals.  Funding increases the Collective Protection System Backfit program M98 filter set life extension, and identifies and tests replacements for obsolete M93 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) components used in numerous hard shelter systems.  The M93 GPFU improvements also address current electromagnetic interference requirements.  MODPROT CP also addresses obsolescence issues in test quality standards for gas filters and tests sealants and coatings to mitigate corrosion on filter systems to extend service life of these systems.

JECP provides the Joint Expeditionary Forces a CP capability which is lightweight, compact, modular, and affordable.  A family of systems, developed in two phases, that will allow the application of CP to transportable soft-side shelters, enclosed spaces of opportunity, and in remote austere locations as a standalone resource.  Phase 1 includes standalone CP systems and kits to provide existing host platforms and structures with CBRN protection.  Phase 2 includes kits to provide other host platforms and structures that were not explicitly designed in Phase 1.  JECP will be capable of protecting personnel groups of varying size, unencumbered by Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), from the effects of CB agents, Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs), radiological particles, heat, dust, and sand.  The employment of JECP is a strategic deterrence against enemy use of CBR agents or TIMs, and will reduce the need for personnel and equipment decontamination.  Funding will develop a field leakage test capability that allows Warfighters to validate the integrity of JECP and other fielded collective protection systems, integrate newly developed filtration material into existing M98 Gas Particulate Filter Sets to provide the Warfighter with improved protection against toxic industrial chemicals and toxic industrial materials while maintaining current performance characteristics against Chemical Warfare Agents and meeting military standards, develop a CP kit for non-CP environmental control units and improve on the current tent liner restraint systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

Modernization Collective Protection (MODPROT CP) leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded collective protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.



JOINT EXPEDITIONARY COLLECTIVE PROTECTION (JECP)

JECP Family of Systems (FoS) (Phase 1 and Phase 2) involves multiple contract types throughout the Engineering and Manufacturing Development and Production and Deployment Phases of the program. Having achieved a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision for Phase 1 Systems in December 2016, the program exercised Fixed Price Incentive production options in FY17 &amp; FY18 through the now expired contract with Leidos in support of Initial Operational Capability (IOC).  A competitive build-to-print follow-on production delivery order under the Joint Enterprise Research, Development, Acquisition, and Production (JE-RDAP) Contract will be awarded to support the remaining production of Phase 1 Systems to meet Full Operational Capability (FOC). Phase 2 systems will be developed as engineering changes to the Phase 1 systems under a separate JE-RDAP competitive delivery order and undergo limited developmental and operational testing in pursuit of a FRP decision. Production options are included in the delivery order to meet FOC for Phase 2 systems.  Additionally, BA7 funding will develop incremental improvements to fielded JECP FoS. BA7 efforts include a range of improvements intended to enhance filtration protection, provide a field leakage test capability and update various fielded environmental control unit interface types for use with collective protection. These efforts involve a simplified acquisition procurement contract and exploitation of commercial off-the-shelf items.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses obsolescence issues with decontamination equipment and the need to modernize the Joint Services fielded chemical and biological with capabilities meeting or exceeding the Services requirements.

The effort included in this project is:
(1) Modernization (MODPROT) Decontamination (Decon) 

Efforts in the MODPROT Decon will address obsolescence and technical data concerns, beginning with the 1) Joint Services Transportable Decontamination System-Small Scale (M26 JSTDS-SS) through validation and verification of technical manual changes as well as technical data for spare and repair parts; 2) the Power Driven Decontamination Apparatus (M12A1 PDDA) by updating technical references and performing the necessary validation and verification before publishing an updated technical manual; and 3) Conduct biological efficacy at relevant environment (i.e. ambient, desert, cold) for Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) to expand wipe capabilities to include performance against biological agents.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

Modernization Decontamination (MODPROT DE) leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded decontamination systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project supports technology refresh of fielded individual protective equipment which enable the warfighter to operate in a contaminated CBR environment with little or no degradation to his/her performance.  

Efforts included in this project are:
(1) Modernization Individual Protection (MODPROT IP) 
(2) Special Purpose Unit Rapid Capability Development and Deployment (SPU RCDD) 
(3) Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM)

MODPROT IP addresses obsolescence issues with Individual Protective equipment and the need to modernize the Joint Services fielded chemical and biological protection with capabilities meeting or exceeding the Services requirements.  MODPROT IP will modernize current chemical protective footwear by conducting Limited User Evaluation (LUE) in support of the Alternative Source Qualification test and evaluation approach for a suitable replacement to the Alternative Footwear Solutions (AFS).  MODPROT IP will also conduct modernization efforts and reverse engineering of maintenance and repair procedures for the Joint Services Mask Leakage Tester (JSMLT).

The SPU RCDD will facilitate rapid response to near-term and emergent chemical-biological (CB) defensive capability requirements from elements of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Force (SOF) Enterprise and other Joint Force enabling units.  SPU RCDD mitigates risk across the CBDP by creating a portfolio of operationally-relevant CB capabilities that can quickly transition to needed elements and formations of the joint force, in part or in whole, in response to the emergent capability needs of the geographic combatant commanders.  These objectives are met by the early transitioning of promising science and technologies (S&amp;T): the focused conduct of combat evaluations and mission-oriented operational assessments to assess technological and mission suitability: and the active leveraging of existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products along with novel redesign approaches to modernize and optimize existing solutions to new challenges supported by "buy-try-decide-acquire" acquisition strategies.  SPU RCDD will provide enhanced CBRN detect and protect capabilities against new and emerging CBRN threats through modernized and technologically-mature component and system enhancements to currently fielded host platforms and legacy systems, thereby extending service life, off-setting costs to initiate a new acquisition program, and putting critical CBRN capabilities in the hands of warfighters by faster acceleration through the acquisition process.  

JSGPM provides for respiratory and ocular protection modernization and enhancements for Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) protection and operational performance in air purifying, powered air purifying, and supplied air functional modes of the Joint Service General Purpose Mask (JSGPM) family of systems. Mask and filter system upgrades will be provided for fielded Protection systems to enhance respiratory and ocular protection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MODERNIZATION PROTECTION (MODPROT)

Modernization Individual Protection (MODPROT IP), leverages mature technology from contractor developed components to address and replace obsolete components of various fielded individual protection systems.  Modernization efforts will also use items developed by the government that have transitioned from lower to higher technology readiness levels that can be inserted into fielded systems.  A combination of competitive and sole source contracts to various industry vendors and project orders to various government activities will be used to adapt previously developed components to modernize systems.  Robust component and system level testing will validate both government and contractor furnished improvements.  The improvements will be added into the specific system's updated technical data packages to be used in engineering change proposals and provided to the item managers.



SPU RAPID CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT (SPU RCDD)

SOF RCDD plans to execute non-traditional programs for capabilities identified by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), select elements from across the Special Operations Force (SOF) Enterprise, and other Joint Force enabling units. The SPU RCDD BA5 acquisition strategy for developmental efforts will allow rapid prototyping and testing of mission critical capabilities needed to enhance mission success. The SPU RCDD BA7 modernization effort will use technical and functional evaluations of currently-fielded items to introduce and incorporate operationally-relevant system developments.  Both efforts will be accomplished by awarding an agreement through the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Transaction Authority (CWMD OTA) for the procurement of test assets. An OTA contracting approach will be used to procure test prototypes and test articles of possible solutions. The OTA consists of a consortium of all potential Industry, research institutions, and non-traditional government that could be potential solvers for the program. Procurement will be through either the OTAs, a Small Business Innovative Research contract, or a more traditional contracting vehicle.

JS GENERAL PURPOSE MASK (JSGPM)

The JSGPM Advanced Respiratory Protection Initiative (ARPI) effort is using the two M61 filter contracts awarded to 3M and Avon to develop improved filters for the JSGPM.  There is a continual technology refreshment CLIN on both contracts that allow for filter development tasks to be awarded.  The tasks can be competed between the two awardees or awarded to both to ensure competition on future spares and delivery orders.  In addition, the new M53A1 mask system contract includes a continual technology refreshment CLIN to develop improvements of mask system performance in air purifying, powered air purifying, and supplied air operational modes for both military and domestic response mission requirements.  As technologies transition from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO), the technologies will be matured from system/subsystem prototyping demonstration technologies at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to actual system "mission proven" through successful mission operations in a mission environment at TRL 9.  In addition to the maturing of the technology, the Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of the technology requires maturing to MRL.  The complexity of maturing all these different items requires an evolutionary approach with one prototype iteration governing the approach on the next iteration.  With the criticality of the mask and filter systems, the production transition to the new improved systems has to be done with a high degree of confidence with risks mitigated to a low level.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides for the upgrade and modernization of fielded Information Systems.  During this phase efforts will execute modernization, bug fixes, and provide support at fielded locations and maintain training and logistics support.  

Efforts included in this project are: 
(1) Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Information Systems (CBRN IS)
(2) Joint Effects Model 1 and 2 (JEM 1 and 2)
(3) Joint Warning and Reporting Network 1 and 2 (JWARN 1 and 2)
(4) Global Biosurveillance Portal (G-BSP)
(5) Software Support Activity (SSA).

CBRN IS will continue to modernize fielded capabilities throughout the lifecycle of the program to ensure compatibility with Service architectures, cloud-hosted environments, and system requirements, to include technical refresh of system hardware and software to maintain compatibility with new technologies and standards as well as cyber security and net centric policies.  This will be integrated into a collaborative environment that allows users to collect and disseminate Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) warning and reporting data, provide detailed CBRN hazard predictions, aid in decision support, and make relevant CBRN defense information available in near-real time.

G-BSP will continue to train warfighters in the use of G-BSP, modernize critical hardware, and ensure compatibility of fielded capabilities. This will be integrated into a web-based enterprise environment that facilitates collaboration, communication, and information sharing in support of the detection, management, and mitigation of man-made and naturally occurring biological hazards. This will result in a set of tools and capabilities that facilitate the timely identification and detection of CBRN events in order to minimize operational impacts to the local and global populations. 

JEM 1 and 2 will continue to update fielded JEM 1 and JEM 2 software due to changing Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and National Guard Command and Control (C2) host architectures, systems, and standards in order to maintain interoperability and avert cyber threats and vulnerabilities to host C2 systems and perform test and evaluation of updated JEM 1 and JEM 2 baselines. This will be integrated into a web-based software application that supplies the Department of Defense (DoD) with the only operationally tested and accredited tool to effectively model and simulate the effects of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) weapon strikes and incidents. This will provide warfighters with the ability to accurately model and predict the time-phased impact of CBRN and Toxic Industrial Chemical/Material (TIC/TIM) events and effects. Additionally, this will support planning efforts to mitigate the effects of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and to provide rapid estimates of hazards and effects integrated into the Common Operational Picture (COP).

JWARN 1 and 2 will continue engineering, development, and modernization efforts to upgrade existing, operational JWARN systems in order to maintain interoperability, efficiency and functionality within the targeted C2 systems and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) milCloud CBRN IS enterprise site and conduct operational testing under utilizing the IT BOX construct and Agile Software development processes. Additionally, JWARN 1 and 2 will provide helpdesk and training support for fielded versions of JWARN 1 and 2 in all host environments. This will be integrated into an accredited DoD warning and reporting system that enables an immediate and integrated response to threats of contamination by WMD, CBRN and TIM incidents. This will provide a digital display of CBRN 1-6 reports on the COP, displayed through Service provided Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems resident at all echelons of command. Commanders will be provided with enhanced situational awareness throughout the area of operation, supports warfighter battle management and continuity of operations in a contaminated environment.

As software-intensive systems, JEM 2, JWARN 2, and G-BSP have no separately identifiable unit production components; unit cost calculations including Program Acquisition Unit Cost/Average Procurement Unit Cost (PAUC/APUC) and Operations and Sustainment (O&amp;S) average annual per unit costs are not applicable.

The SSA will continue to support programs in the Interoperability and Supportability (I&amp;S) certification, Information Support Plan (ISP), and Data and Service Exposure Verification and Registration, provide and update program of record integrated architectures and provide Net-Centric Policy implementation Assistance; and continue to maintain proper Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (CS/IA) accreditation of any system within the CBDP portfolio. This will provide the Chem-Bio Defense user developmental support and service organization to facilitate net-centric interoperability of systems in acquisition for the Warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>BIOSURVEILLANCE PORTAL (BSP)

The Global-Biosurveillance Portal (Global-BSP) program will continue to meet the requirements as set forth in the USSOCOM Information Systems Capability Development Document (IS CDD), 19 May 2014. The Global-BSP program will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for program requirements, management, and development. The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies in less time and fielding products to the DoD utilizing an incremental delivery approach. IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event. Capabilities will be developed and delivered in a series of Capability Drops (CDs). There are two planned Production Capability Drops and two Engineering Capability Drops planned in each FY.  Developmental Testing (DT) and end-to-end tests (E2E) will be conducted for each CD to verify capabilities prior to delivery to the Warfighter.  User Feedback Events (UFEs) will be conducted with identified Users to elicit feedback on developed capabilities and input on required adjustments to address new technologies. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in July 2016. A Full Operational Test &amp; Evaluation will be conducted prior to Final Operational Capability to be delivered in 3QFY20. The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

CBRN INFORMATION SYSTEMS

CBRN-IS acquisition strategy utilizes a Family-of-Systems (FoS) approach to align multiple programs of record capabilities to the CBRN-IS architecture and operational environment.  CBRN-IS enterprise will initially integrate appropriate JPEO-CBD products into a FoS framework beginning with the Joint Warning and Reporting (JWARN) and Joint Effects Model (JEM) program capabilities.  CBRN-IS leverages the concepts of CBRN Hazard Awareness and Understanding and DISA Enterprise Services to integrate current CBRN capabilities, and other information and intelligence services, applications, and systems to provide increased situational awareness and decision support to commanders for CBRN defense.  The strategy supports the implementation of integrated early warning capabilities by incorporating the inclusion of mature science and technology products and emerging technologies from existing ATD and experimental capability demonstrations (ECD).  CBRN-IS utilizes the Agile software development process with the IT Box acquisition strategy to provide for the spiral development and fielding of modular capability packages.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL (JEM)

JEM 2 acquisition will utilize the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and fielding products to the service more frequently than an incremental delivery approach.

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.  MS B is followed by a series of supporting Build Decisions (BDs) associated with each RDP as they are released.  The supporting BDs will ensure incorporation of mature technology and development efforts culminating in incremental deliveries of capability to Joint and Service Command and Control (C2) architectures.  Instead of a single Milestone C (MS C) decision and fielding event for one increment, the program will return to the MDA for more frequent fielding decisions, as often as annually, as portions of capability are determined suitable and operationally effective.  These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

As part of this strategy a single JEM 2 integrator, General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), was selected as the prime development contract in March 2017. 

The current contractor for JEM 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1, CD 2.2, and CD 2.3 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The contract awarded in March 2017 includes scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JEM 2 contract.  The contract utilizes full and open competition and is referred to as the JEM 1 and 2 development, modernization and sustainment contract.

An over-arching MS B and Build Decision for RDP-1 were approved by the MDA in Q4 FY14, and a CD1.1 Fielding Decision and a RDP-2 Build Decision were approved in Q3 FY16.  Each subsequent RDP will have a single Build Decision and each CD will have an associated Fielding Decision.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

JOINT WARNING &amp; REPORTING NETWORK (JWARN)

JWARN 2 utilizes the JROC's "IT Box" construct for software requirements management and development.  The intent is to provide the next generation of capability with current and future technologies, as stated in the IS ICD, in less time and away from an incremental delivery approach.  This effort is being executed under a Cost-Plus-Award Term Incentive structure to gain maximum benefit to the Government in maintaining the fielded baseline and future software capability development and was awarded under a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP).  

IT Box enables programs to tailor the incrementally fielded software program model in the DODI 5000.02 to conduct multiple, more frequent fielding events in lieu of a single fielding event.  Programs conduct a single Milestone B (MS B) decision by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) that covers the entire program.

These multiple fielding efforts are based on providing capabilities with the most value to the operators based on Warfighter priorities/needs, maturation of the technology being incorporated and available resources supporting the effort.

The JWARN 2 Program will find an appropriate Sensor Connectivity Capability (SCC) to facilitate the transfer of CBRN sensor information from legacy CBRN sensors to DoD networks.  This solution will be external to the CBRN Sensors and Service-identified network transmission device(s).

The current contractor for JWARN 2, Northrup Grumman, will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1) and RDP-2 documents.

As part of the strategy for a single JWARN 2 integrator, a follow-on contract was awarded in December 2018.  The follow-on contractor, DCS Corp, for JWARN 2 will provide all capabilities defined in the Requirement Definition Package 1 (RDP-1), Capability Drop 1.1 (CD 1.1), Capability Drop 1.2 (CD 1.2), and RDP-2 / CD 2.1 documents.  It is anticipated that the JRO will release further RDP-1 CDs, RDP-3, and RDP-4 prior to contract completion.  The follow-on contract in FY18 will include scope for developing the remaining capabilities under the JWARN contract.  The JWARN 2 follow-on contract will utilize full and open competition and will be referred to as the JWARN 2 software development and maintenance contract.

The maintenance/sustainment of the capability as an IT system will continue within CBRN IS in FY23.

SOFTWARE SUPPORT ACTIVITY (SSA)

The SSA provides enterprise-wide services and coordination across all CBDP programs that contain data or software, or are capable of linking to the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The SSA facilitates interoperability, integration, and supportability of existing and developing IT and National Security Systems (NSS).  This will be followed by coordination to facilitate the concepts of interoperability, integration and supportability of enterprise-wide services.  Next follows work with user communities to develop and demonstrate enterprise-wide common architectures, products and services.  The SSA will support the application of the enterprise-wide architectures, products and services into the programs, with verification of compliance with the defined products and services.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The project supports technology refresh of fielded medical diagnostic systems and associated capabilities (e.g., assays) that contribute to the layered medical defenses against biological warfare agent threats facing U.S. Forces in the field.

Efforts in this project include:
(1) Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagostic System (JBAIDS)
(2) Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) 

JBAIDS is a commercial off the shelf system that provides a critical capability to identify bacterial and viral agents in environmental surveillance and clinical specimen sample types. The JBAIDS is reaching its end of life.  Replacement of JBAIDS with NGDS Increment 1 began in 2017 and will achieve full replacement by the end of FY20. 

The NGDS is a family of systems providing increments of diagnostic capabilities over time that address varied CBR threats across the different echelons of the Combat Health Support System. The mission of the NGDS is to provide CBR threat and infectious disease identification and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared diagnostics to inform individual patient treatment and CBR situational awareness and disease surveillance. NGDS Increment 1 improves diagnostic capabilities in deployable and laboratory-based combat health support units. NGDS Inc 1 offers improved operational suitability and affordability over legacy systems by developing FDA cleared biological warfare agent (BWA) and infectious disease in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays on an existing commercial diagnostic device with a well-established FDA regulatory history and pipeline of commercial non-BWA infectious disease diagnostic tests.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JOINT BIO AGENT IDENT AND DIAG SYSTEM (JBAIDS)

JBAIDS is a commercial off-the-shelf capability to identify multiple biological agents and other pathogens of operations concern, to include environmental and FDA cleared in vitro diagnostic assays.  JBAIDS also has pre-positioned Emergency Use Authorizations assays for the identification of low probability, high consequence pathogens in clinical samples that can be deployed in the event of a declared health emergency.  The JBAIDS program is preparing for full replacement by NGDS Increment 1 systems, beginning in FY17.

NEXT GENERATION DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM (NGDS)

The NGDS Increment 1 program was a MS A to MS C - acquisition strategy, with MS C approval granted in Dec 2016 for limited production and fielding.  NGDS 1 is replacing the legacy Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) beginning in FY17. NGDS 1 Full Rate Production was approved in Aug 2018.

The NGDS 2 program addresses CBR agents and COEs that the NGDS 1 Film Array does not address. More than one materiel solution is required to expand the scope of CBR agent diagnostics across multiple echelons of care. NGDS 2 will employ a family of systems approach to bridge identified capability gaps for man-portable diagnostics, immunoassay diagnostics, and chemical diagnostics systems. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a man-portable diagnostic capability in FY17, while continuing to conduct risk reduction efforts for the other capabilities. NGDS 2 initiated prototyping of a chemical diagnostic capability in FY18. Separate decisions will be utilized to proceed with further development and production for each capability, based on individual determinations of technology maturity to meet user requirements. Development efforts are anticipated to be cost-plus awards using Other Transactions Authority (OTA) agreements to take advantage of nontraditional Defense contractor offerings.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

INATS, which includes Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prophylactics, pre-treatments, and therapeutics, is intended to protect and/or sustain the Joint Service Member in a toxic chemical threat environment. Efforts and studies conducted under this project address direction from the FDA to conduct specific post-New Drug Application (NDA)-approval efforts and studies (e.g. required studies, Post Marketing Commitments), and requirements from the joint service users for the FDA-approved Soman Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine (SNAPP) product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Oxime Component - The development of a new and improved oxime, MMB4, (replacing 2-PAM) to treat current and emerging nerve agent threats, is one component of the INATS Development Program. Both the oxime and the centrally acting components are required to address the current and emerging nerve agent threat and to mitigate their effects. MMB4 is a relatively new chemical entity transitioning from Science and Technology Development. MMB4 requires the conduct of studies to resume the Phase 1 Clinical Trial, preparation for the Phase 2 clinical trials, the manufacturing of the drug product for both these trials, the conduct of non-clinical studies to determine toxicity, and the conduct of premonitory studies to determine the impact of nerve transmissions.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides revitalization of existing instrumentation and technology upgrades to equipment at West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), in support of their Chemical and Biological (CB) test mission. 

Efforts included in the project are:
(1) T&amp;E Upgrades (T&amp;E UPGRAD)
(2) Biological Test Branch T&amp;E Upgrade (BTB UPGRADE)

The T&amp;E Upgrade effort supports upgrades to equipment for the Major Test Chambers Materiel Test Facility (MTF) which house the secondary containment modules (SCMs) for Non-Traditional Agent (NTA) testing, as well as other detector test chambers and Building 4165) at WDTC which houses the small item decontamination (SID) test fixture, swatch test fixtures, as well as several smaller labs (2) the CB Test Grid at WDTC which includes all dissemination, field referee equipment, and support equipment (generators, CP) and will include all upgraded test grid equipment transitioned from PD CCATTI and (3) the Combined Chemical Test Facility (CCTF) which includes the majority of chemical analytical equipment including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer, Gas Chromatograph (GC), GC-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), MS triple quads, Miniature Chemical Agent Monitoring System (MINICAMS), GASMETs, Liquid Chromatography MS (LCMS) and the majority of the laboratory hood space at WDTC.

BTB UPGRADE supports the MRTFB test mission of the Biological Test Branch (BTB) through instrumentation revitalization and technology upgrades to aging and obsolete equipment. These efforts maintain readiness at the BTB, which is the MRTFB's only laboratory equipped to test with aerosolized biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agents. The BTB test mission requires cutting-edge biological laboratory and field testing capabilities to ensure the ability of the Department of Defense to test state-of-the-art materiel under development against known and emergent biological threats. Essential instrumentation requiring periodic revitalization and modernization due to technological obsolescence includes dissemination, referee, and support (e.g., generators, collective protection) equipment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

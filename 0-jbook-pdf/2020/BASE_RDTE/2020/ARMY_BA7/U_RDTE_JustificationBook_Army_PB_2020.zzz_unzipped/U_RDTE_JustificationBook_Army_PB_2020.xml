            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Program element 0603778A supports development and testing of the Army's rocket launcher fleet, including the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher. MLRS and HIMARS launchers support the Army's number one priority modernization effort, Long Range Precision Fires.  Updated launchers are required to fire current and developmental munitions such as the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).

Project 093. The M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. MLRS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. MLRS is a tracked, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing two pods of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.  Project 093 funds software development, training updates, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation, and integration of satellite communications for the MLRS launcher.

Justification:
FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $9.563 million for Project 093 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a MLRS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The increase from FY2019 funds additional research and development related to Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam, Anti-Spoofing capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the MLRS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.  Conducts delta testing of the Improved Armored Cab (IAC) with the new vendor.

Project DX8. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.   Project DX8 funds software development, training updates, and Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation for the HIMARS launcher. 

Justification:
FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $13.314 million for Project DX8 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The increase from FY2019 funds additional research and development related to Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam, Anti-Spoofing capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the HIMARS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher is a full-spectrum, combat-proven, all-weather, 24/7 lethal and responsive, precision strike weapon system. HIMARS provides critical missile precision strike, operational shaping fires, counterfire, and close support destructive and suppressive fires. HIMARS is a C-130 or C-17 transportable, wheeled, indirect fire, rocket/missile launcher capable of firing one pod of precision rockets/missiles from the current and emerging Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM), to include the Extended Range (ER) Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). These munitions are capable of engaging targets with precision at ranges in excess of 400 kilometers.   Project DX8 funds software development, training updates, and Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (APNT) technology implementation for the HIMARS launcher. 

Justification:
FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $13.314 million for Project DX8 continues tactical launcher software development and testing to support the Fire Control System (FCS) obsolescence mitigation hardware upgrade required to operate a HIMARS launcher.  The tactical software is a critical developmental item required to field additional launchers, maintain backward compatibility for current fleet sustainment, and is the first release of government developed software common to both the MLRS and HIMARS launcher.  The increase from FY 2019 funds additional research and development related to Global Positioning System (GPS) Anti-Jam, Anti-Spoofing capabilities, and integration of satellite communications, allowing the HIMARS to continue to effectively operate in near peer threat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project ER2: The Close Combat Technology program includes development efforts to upgrade Close Combat technologies, energetics, and munitions, such as counter explosives, grenades, demolitions, shoulder launched munitions, pyrotechnic simulators, countermeasure flares, non-lethal ammunition/systems, networked munitions and mines, that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production.  This program will identify, characterize, study, analyze, test and develop technologies to resolve close combat munition reliability, safety, environmental, storage, standardization, obsolescence and manufacturing/producibility issues.

FY 2020 funds resource improvements to XM111 Offensive Hand Grenade.
 
Project ER5: The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology Project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production.  Initiatives include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.  FY 2020 funds will support engineering testing and evaluation on replacement electronic transceiver prototypes for indirect and direct fire proximity fuzes, testing on optimized impact switches for use in mortar and medium caliber fuzes that will improve producibility, testing of the medium caliber fuze safety design modifications, analysis of prototype low cost electronic safe and arm devices, analysis on hand grenade fuzes to reduce the number of critical defects that will improve producibility and increase safety, and evaluations on the next generation microcontroller to replace a one-time programmable component due to part obsolescence for mortar proximity fuzes.  FY 2020 funds will also support qualification of Hexachloroethane Titanium Oxide (HX) smoke fill formulation into the 81mm smoke family of ammunitions.  Engineering efforts will identify the formulation percentage of constituents and identify the production processes required to promote effective smoke production that is less toxic and ultimately provides effective smoke screening and burn time performance.  FY 2020 funds will also support reliability improvements and increased range within current fielded Artillery and Mortar Conventional Ammunition.

Project ER6: The Direct Fire Technology funding will be used to support direct fire ammunition from small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade, medium caliber cannon ammunition and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements. FY 2020 funds are used for a more lethal and safer design for 40mm grenades that will be built and tested. Warhead improvement and primer improvement for 30mm ammunition are also under development.  A number of improvements for training ammunition, environmentally friendly primers, and lightweight small caliber ammunition will continue to be developed. Potential improvements to 105mm and 120mm ammunition will be examined.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The use of HC has been restricted inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) due to its toxic effects.  The legacy AN-M8 grenade is limited to use in contingency operations only.  The M83 training smoke grenade is currently used in lieu of the AN-M8 in both training and tactical operations, but does not give screening performance comparable to the legacy AN-M8.  Soldiers must use two or three M8 grenades to produce obscuration effects comparable to a single AN-M8 grenade.</r2:Description>

Follow-on procurement efforts will be competitive pending market research.  
The strategy for the AN-M8A1 is to qualify an alternative fill due to obsolescence and manufacturability driven changes required to provide smoke for use by Soldiers to meet existing validated requirements.  Once the smoke fill is qualified, the plan is to investigate the cost and impact to upgrade the Pine Bluff Arsenal grenade loading facilities
The M82 program is updating the design of specific parts to make it more producible and will be proving out the design for use in future production efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Indirect Fire and Fuze Technology Project includes product improvement development efforts to upgrade indirect fire weapon systems and munitions that have already been fielded and/or are in production. Indirect Fire Weapons and Munitions Product Improvement Projects include improved target engagement, increased reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety, standardization and interoperability with weapons and munitions of Allied Nations, defense exportability features, reduction of failure mechanisms, and supply chain risk through introduction of new and alternative technology and materiel solutions, improvement of manufacturing methods and their associated production and life cycle support processes, new capabilities in response to the evolving and emerging threats and countermeasures, and reduction/elimination of potential environmental and health risks associated with these products.

This Project supports the identification, study, analysis, and development of fuzing technologies and safe arm devices in production and in the field.  This Project will implement technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The Project addresses two major areas: (1) analysis and (2) block upgrades.  Analysis efforts will identify second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce costs by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available.  It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects.  The second major area is block upgrades, which will identify and perform studies on improvements to fuzes, increase commonality of fuze components and requirements.  Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities.  FY 2020 funds will support the engineering tests and evaluations on the prototype replacement electronic transceiver prototypes for indirect fire and direct fire proximity fuzes, will conduct engineering tests on optimized impact switches for use in mortar and medium caliber fuzes that will improve producibility, will conduct engineering tests of the medium caliber fuze safety design modifications, will support the analysis of the prototype low cost electronic safe and arm devices, will support the analysis on the hand grenade fuzes to reduce the number of critical defects that will improve producibility and increase safety, and will conduct evaluations on the next generation microcontroller to replace a one-time programmable component due to part obsolescence for mortar proximity fuzes.

This Project also supports the incorporation of the new Hexachloroethane Titanium Oxide (HX) smoke fill formulation while utilizing the existing illumination shell body configuration to support mortar smoke training for US Army Europe (USAREUR).  The HX smoke fill formulation is less toxic and less incendiary than the current Mortar Red Phosphorus (RP) or White Phosphorous (WP) Smoke rounds and will reduce risk of unintended collateral damage or environmentally hazardous waste.  USAREUR has yearly requirements for procurement of smoke mortar cartridges across all calibers to be used for training, but is prohibited from training with the current WP or RP smoke munitions in Europe due to environmental restrictions.  FY 2020 funds support qualification of HX smoke fill formulation into the 81mm smoke family of ammunitions.  Engineering efforts will identify the formulation percentage of constituents and identify the production processes required to promote effective smoke production that is less toxic and ultimately provides effective smoke screening and burn time performance.

This Project also supports artillery and mortar conventional ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy and general product improvements.  FY 2020 funding will support reliability improvements and increased range within current fielded Artillery and Mortar Conventional Ammunition.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Fuze Technology Improvements (FTI) will improve current production munitions by exploiting existing fuzing technologies and inserting them into current fielded and/or production fuzes, providing safer, more producible, and more lethal fuzing solutions.  FTI develops second source suppliers and resolves component obsolescence issues to mitigate risk and prevent production interruptions in order to continue to provide safer, more reliable munitions for the Warfighter with significant risk reduction to production fuzes also benefiting the U.S. Taxpayer.  The effort is a continuation of studies, analysis, evaluations, and development of fuzing technologies and safe and arm devices in production and in the field.  This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude component obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions.  The Fuze Technology Integration Program utilizes both the DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to produce prototypes of the fuze technologies and devices, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contracts to implement proven efforts into production fuzes.

The Hexachloroethane Titanium Oxide (HX) smoke mortar cartridge project will use existing production process and technologies at Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facilities that currently produce 60mm/81mm/120mm smoke and illumination munitions.  Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA) Pyro will be responsible for mixing and pressing HX smoke compositions for all testing and development, and CAAA fabrication shop will produce smoke canisters.  Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA) will conduct body load and Load Assemble and Pack (LAP) of all cartridge test samples for qualification and validation testing. All other components will use standard parts currently in inventory or can be purchased through existing component contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), formerly known as Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), is the Army's next generation surface to surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities. PrSM requirements include: max range of greater than 400km, specified lethality against the designated target set, a Launch Pod Missile Container (LPMC) that holds two missiles, survivability in a threat environment, and compatibility with the existing launcher platforms (M270A1 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)). PrSM will meet cluster and insensitive munition requirements. PrSM is being designed with an open system architecture that provides the capability for future growth to counter new and emerging threats. Spiral 1 will include the ability to attack moving maritime and ground targets, Spiral 2 will provide increased lethality, and Spiral 3 will provide extended range. The mission of the PrSM System is to attack/neutralize/ suppress/destroy targets using missile delivered indirect precision fires. PrSM will provide Joint Force Commanders with a 24/7, all-weather capability to attack critical and time sensitive area and point targets including threat air defense, missile launchers, command and control centers, assembly/staging areas and high payoff targets at all depths of the multi-domain battlefield. The PrSM will counter the enemy's ability to conduct combat maneuver and air defense operations. Milestone A; Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) was approved on 31 March 2017.

FY20 base dollars in the amount of $164.182 million supports the continuation of PrSM development and qualification. In 3QFY17, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. In FY20, contractors will continue TMRR efforts to include: conduct prototype test flights, finalize tactical designs, build six (6) PrSM Engineering Development Test (EDT) missiles, conduct component and system level qualification testing, finalize missile interface and continue software integration with existing launcher platforms, and begin production planning efforts. The culmination of these efforts will inform a Critical Design Review (CDR) planned for 1QFY22. Demonstrating PrSM capabilities through a rigorous test program, will ensure the Army makes an informed down-select decision based on the performance of the contractor's proposed design. The program will conduct critical missile survivability assessments to ensure the design that transitions to Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) will successfully meet the Army's PrSM requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>FY18 funding reflects an adjustment of $21.324M which includes a -$4M congressional directed reduction for cybersecurity software, -$14M congressional directed reduction for TMRR contract delay, and -$3.256M for SBIR/STTR Transfer.

FY19 funding reflects an adjustment of $33.902M which includes a -$25M congressional directed reduction for "TMRR excess growth" and -$2M congressional directed reduction for "Restoring acquisition accountability: Program management excess growth" and -$6.902M for SBIR/STTR Transfer.

FY20 funding reflects an increase of $75.000M to maintain competition with both contractors to finalize PrSM tactical designs, build additional missiles, and conduct EDT component and missile flight testing. The FY20 increase reduces program risk and ensures an informed down-select decision in support of urgent operational fielding in 1QFY23.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PrSM Acquisition Strategy supports development of the Army's next generation surface to surface missile that replaces and improves upon Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) capabilities with major improvements in range, effectiveness, lethality, and rate of fire, while meeting insensitive and cluster munition policy requirements. PrSM provides an open system architecture that facilitates future growth. PrSM provides responsive engagement of high value point and area targets by Army and Joint Force Commanders under all weather conditions, at operational ranges defended by enemy air-defense systems. An AoA supporting the MS A decision was completed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range (TRAC-WSMR), with an OSD letter of sufficiency issued in September 2015. In 4QFY16, the Army awarded 9 month risk reduction, trade study and initial design development agreements to two contractors. The effort resulted in development of initial baseline designs presented during final technical reviews that resulted in a seamless transition into the TMRR phase. Subsequent to MS A approval on 31 March 2017, the Army awarded TMRR agreements to two contractors. TMRR is ongoing and includes risk reduction activities and further maturation of contractor design concepts. Both contractors participated in a PDR in 1QFY19 and have begun to receive hardware for assembling four (4) system level missile prototypes culminating in flight tests to provide demonstration of their system capabilities.

In FY18, the Army directed acceleration of PrSM capability in response to immediate near-peer threats and the requirement to engage targets with a precision guided missile out to 499km. As a result, the program was restructured to conduct the following key activities previously not planned for in TMRR: finalize tactical designs, build additional missiles for system level Engineering Development Testing (EDT) flight tests, and establish a production capability. This approach allows the Army to reduce program risk, make a more informed down-select decision at EMD, and accelerate an early capability. Component and system level testing will inform contractor down-select at EMD. 

The EMD phase will complete product development, qualification, production readiness assessment, and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The funding associated with the Apache Product Improvement Program funding line, previously known as Apache Block III, funded the non-recurring engineering
(NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began
in Oct 2011). The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build. This project addresses reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft. Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability,
Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)
integration. Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications. The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and
meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

(NRE), development, and testing work associated with the planned remanufacture and new build Apache aircraft in the AH-64E configuration (deliveries began
in Oct 2011). The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP), AH-64E Remanufacture and AH-64E New Build. This project 
addresses reliability challenges and provides increased combat capability to the aircraft. Upgrades include: Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)
Level III-IV Control, Improved Situational Awareness, Upgraded Communications Suite, Improved Drive and Propulsion Systems, Improved Targeting Capability,
Increased Computer Processing Capability and Speed, Improved Navigation Systems, Improved Diagnostics and Maintainability, and Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM)
integration. Upgrades are integrated as incremental block modifications. The program addresses operational shortfalls identified during real-world combat missions and
meets Longbow Apache Capability Production Document (CPD) requirements for modernization.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>MEDEVAC:
Independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), incremental RDT&amp;E funding to support integration of a MEDEVAC capability on UH-60V is planned for FY19-22.  In accordance with AR 40-60, Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the Army's Aeromedical Evacuation capability is funded by two portfolio managers, PEOAVN and MRMC.  PEOAVN is responsible for the integration of MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package (MEP) on the UH-60V.  MRMC is responsible for recurring costs to procure kits and resource the installation of MEP kits on UH-60V MEDEVAC helicopters.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>UH-60V:
The H-60L Digital Blackhawk, now designated as UH-60V, is designed to update the existing H-60L analog architecture to a digital infrastructure enabling the upgraded aircraft to have a similar Pilot-Vehicle Interface (PVI) to the H-60M.  The program will address current capability gaps and meet operational requirements by employing an evolutionary acquisition approach to leverage mature technologies that have been successfully integrated on other military aircraft.  The program will reduce obsolescence and increase commonality and interoperability by installing a digital cockpit, bussing and upgrading the communication/identification suite, improving navigation guidance, and integrating Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), digital moving map, and Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) messaging. Continuing funding will provide hardware and software development, training material development, as well as developmental and operational testing.

MEDEVAC:
Beginning in FY19, RDT&amp;E funding will support non-recurring engineering to integrate and qualify MEDEVAC MEP into the UH-60V Black Hawk helicopter.  This MEDEVAC MEP integration effort is independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).  The Surgeon General (TSG) has a requirement for a MEDEVAC capability provided by Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but are designated to support the MEDEVAC mission. In accordance with AR 40-60 Medical Materiel Acquisition Policy, the PEOAVN is responsible for the costs associated with medical MEP integration on Black Hawk helicopters that were not initially produced for MEDEVAC, but require medical MEP modifications/upgrades to support the MEDEVAC mission.  MEDEVAC MEP integration on the UH-60V will address obsolescence and reduce the logistics footprint by increasing equipment commonality across the MEDEVAC fleet and will reduce the number of Black Hawk MEDEVAC configurations.  Additionally, UH-60V MEDEVAC capabilities will increase when comparing MEDEVAC MEP integration on legacy Black Hawk helicopters.  Capability improvements will include simultaneous Rescue Hoist and extended range capability, enabled MEDEVAC Mission Sensor (MMS) use in Arctic conditions, UH-60V Multi-Function Display (MFD) integrated MMS video, and Multi-Function Controller Unit (MFCU) integration of MMS functions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>MN1000, MEDEVAC Mission Equipment Package (MEP) provides procurement funding for MEDEVAC MEP capability on UH-60 helicopters.  Starting in FY22, MN1000 will resource procurement of MEDEVAC MEP kits and installations at a rate of 15 aircraft per year through FY34, which is the estimated year the AAO of 200 UH-60V MEDEVAC is reached.  Figures shown above reflect the full MN1000 - OPA3/MN1000/Combat Support Medical funding line, which includes the production kits and MEP installation costs at CCAD.    UH-60V MEDEVAC MEP MN1000 OPA requirements are $5.7M in FY22, $6.1M in FY23, and $6.1M in FY24.  Total MEDEVAC MEP requirement in MN1000 through FY34 is $88.1M.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The UH-60V program plans to leverage the Prototype Integration Facility (PIF), a Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) facility, to design, integrate and build three production representative aircraft. The GOGO facility uses a cost plus contract vehicle and conducted full and open competition for the selection of the avionics solution provider.

Independent of the UH-60V Program of Record and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), the MEDEVAC MEP program plans to utilize the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Prototype Integration Facility (PIF) to design and integrate MEDEVAC capability into the UH-60V.  By leveraging the same Government Owned/Government Operated (GOGO) facility utilized by the UH-60V program, efficient design, software development, integration, and testing will occur by eliminating redundant tasks and employing experienced government resources already in possession of pertinent UH-60V technical data required to support the MEDEVAC MEP non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort.  Prototype, validation, and verification of technical publications, as well as airworthiness testing will be accomplished following completion of the UH-60V IOT&amp;E, at which time up to two UH-60V EDM aircraft will be allocated to the MEDEVAC MEP program.  Following completion of MEDEVAC MEP NRE, technical products will feed production and fielding contracts, which will be resourced by MEDCOM.  Procurement funding is programmed on MN1000 Combat Support Medical, G13010 MEDEVAC MEP.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Funds in this Program Element (PE) were realigned from PE 0203744A Aircraft Modifications/Product Improvement Programs, Project Number 430 Improved Cargo Helicopter.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports continued modernization of the Army's only heavy lift helicopter the CH-47F Chinook providing tomorrow's heavy lift readiness.  The CH-47F project funds modernization, integration and improvements to the CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters through the CH-47F Block II program of record.  

The CH-47F is a twin-turbine, tandem-rotor, heavy-lift transport helicopter with a useful load of up to 25,000 lbs, representing an essential element of Muti-Domain Battle Operations.  The CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters perform over 95% of the Army's heavy lift missions including troop transport, air assault and resupply in combat, combat support and combat service support roles.

The CH-47F Block II program provides additional benefits to increase commonality and interoperability between the two platforms, improve design life, lower maintenance cost, enhance reliability, safety, airworthiness, and cybersecurity.  Additionally, funding supports full component qualification for numerous aircraft subsystems such as the Improved Drive Train (IDT) and Advanced Chinook Rotor Blade (ACRB), which increase performance in all environmental conditions (especially at high altitude and increased temperature).  The CH-47F Block II program restores payload lost through mission equipment package (MEP) growth and enhances flight control systems, while providing the most cost effective procurement alternative to maintain heavy lift capability and reduce Operation &amp; Support (O&amp;S) costs.

The Cargo Project Management Office awarded the CH-47F Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in July 2017.  The EMD phase will produce three production representative test articles to support a Milestone C decision in the 4th quarter of FY21.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports continued modernization of the Army's only heavy lift helicopter the CH-47F Chinook providing tomorrow's heavy lift readiness.  The CH-47F project funds modernization, integration and improvements to the CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters through the CH-47F Block II program of record.  

The CH-47F is a twin-turbine, tandem-rotor, heavy-lift transport helicopter with a useful load of up to 25,000 lbs, representing an essential element of Muti-Domain Battle Operations.  The CH-47F and MH-47G helicopters perform over 95% of the Army's heavy lift missions including troop transport, air assault and resupply in combat, combat support and combat service support roles.

The CH-47F Block II program provides additional benefits to increase commonality and interoperability between the two platforms, improve design life, lower maintenance cost, enhance reliability, safety, airworthiness, and cybersecurity.  Additionally, funding supports full component qualification for numerous aircraft subsystems such as the Improved Drive Train (IDT) and Advanced Chinook Rotor Blade (ACRB), which increase performance in all environmental conditions (especially at high altitude and increased temperature).  The CH-47F Block II program restores payload lost through mission equipment package (MEP) growth and enhances flight control systems, while providing the most cost effective procurement alternative to maintain heavy lift capability and reduce Operation &amp; Support (O&amp;S) costs.

The Cargo Project Management Office awarded the CH-47F Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract in July 2017.  The EMD phase will produce three production representative test articles to support a Milestone C decision in the 4th quarter of FY21.  This phase will include contractor and Government led system level qualification testing.  The contractor led system level qualification testing includes both ground and flight test.  The Government led system level qualification testing includes Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3), Limited User Test (LUT) and aircraft subsystem Live-Fire Test and Evaluation (LFTE).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Transportable Flight Proficiency Simulator (TFPS) is a certified transportable flight trainer featuring a high fidelity visual display, detailed cockpit representation and motion cueing seats.  It is capable of training mission tasks and emergency procedures and provides a cost savings when compared to using aircraft for these purposes.  The TFPS will increase safety and mitigate risk to Block II Limited User Test (LUT) aircrews by allowing pilots to train aircraft differences in modifications, handling qualities, performance and human factors considerations before actual flight is performed.  Training in the TFPS reduces LUT timelines and improves aircrew proficiency as confirmed in the CH-47F (Block I) Phase 2 User Test Report.  The initial Block II TFPS will also serve as building block for upgrading the fielded TFPSs to the Block II configuration.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>ITEP develops, tests, qualifies, and integrates the next generation turboshaft engine on the Black Hawk and Apache aircraft.  The Improved Turbine Engine (ITE) replaces the existing T700 engine design originated in the 1970's and meets the operational requirement of 6,000 feet pressure altitude and 95 degrees (6K/95).  The ITE will fit inside the existing engine bays of the Black Hawk and Apache Helicopters and provides a significant power enhancement of up to fifty percent (total of 3,000 class shaft horsepower) with increased fuel efficiency.  Additional benefits include improved design life, enhanced reliability, lower maintenance cost and restored capability lost due to aircraft weight growth, without increasing the logistics footprint.  The program consists of systems engineering and program management, detailed design engineering, design assurance, hardware manufacturing and testing, component and module level development and testing, system level testing and qualification, as well as integration into the airframe.

FY 2019 funds the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract that will be awarded to one vendor, platform/engine integration design engineering, and ballistic assessments ending in FY 2020. FY 2020 funding continues both the EMD effort and platform/engine integration A-kit development, resulting in a Critical Design Review (CDR). Engine component testing will begin, and engine fit check will be performed for both platforms. FY 2021 continues the EMD effort, continues A-Kit component testing, begins Preliminary Flight Rating (PFR) testing leading to First Engine To Test (FETT). FY 2021 also begins physical airframe integration. FY 2022 funding will continue PFR testing, leading to a Flight Test Air Worthiness Release (AWR) in early FY 2023. FY 2023 funding provides for aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk and the initiation of engine full qualification testing. FY 2024 funding provides for completion of engine qualification, completion of aircraft flight/qualification testing for both Apache and Black Hawk, and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This effort is a continuation of Modernized Rocket Launcher Increment 1 and Smart Digital Interface efforts; merging these efforts will allow the government to align technology enabling solutions with the AAWSSM ICD, maturing technological developments of Integrated Munitions Launcher (IML) prototypes at the subsystem level to mitigate Apache helicopter and Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial System launcher obsolescence limitations.

The  Integrated Munitions Launcher (IML) effort will define and provide the interface between aircraft and emerging munitions utilizing a non-proprietary, open systems architecture allowing easy compatibility when integrating on to aviation platforms. The inherent flexibility of an open architecture serves as a building block for future weapons systems. This effort includes the design of a launcher with future smart, two-way digital communications capability and the capability to launch current and future weapons from aviation aircraft</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) software and hardware modernization effort updates the operating system from a proprietary system to a hardware agnostic Modular Open Systems Architecture that supports the separation of flight and mission critical functionality.  Builds software infrastructure in accordance with a modular open systems approach (MOSA); more specifically, this open software architecture will strictly adhere to the Future Airborne Computing Environment (FACE) and UAS Control Segment (UCS) standards.  This software will also support emerging Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) and Scalable Control Interface (SCI) requirements.

Current Universal Products consist of the UGCS, the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) and the Universal Mission Simulator (UMS).  The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems.  UGCS is protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS commands multi-UAS missions by controlling flight as well as receiving and disseminating battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles (UAS Cockpit).  Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.  Future GCS modifications will allow scaled down sizes of GCS to support expeditionary operations.

The UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control and UAS payload products.  The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.

The Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1, IAW Army aviation standards.  The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of [Directorate of Simulation (DOS)] Shadow and Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft systems.

The OSRVT Increment II consists of a Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER), Miltope tablet, Antennas, UHF Modem, Type I encryption, Ku-Directional Antennas (KuDA) with an On-The-Move (OTM) capable variant, and an extended range Mobile Directional Antennas System (MDAS). Software supports decoding Telemetry Data from multiple Manned/Unmanned Aircraft Systems, provides Electro-Optical (EO)/Infrared (IR) payload control, and supports off-target calculations. OSRVT supports current operations and emerging requirements.

Justification: FY2020 Universal Product Base funding of $32.016M will be used for continuing the development of modifications needed to address UGCS modernization utilizing MOSA, maintain interoperability, increase commonality for the Family of UAS, Gray Eagle (MQ-1C), and Shadow (RQ-7) programs of record as well as SCI including Systems Engineering, Logistics, and Program Management.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) software and hardware modernization effort updates the operating system from a proprietary system to a hardware agnostic Modular Open Systems Architecture that supports the separation of flight and mission critical functionality.  Builds software infrastructure in accordance with a modular open systems approach (MOSA); more specifically, this open software architecture will strictly adhere to the Future Airborne Computing Environment (FACE) and UAS Control Segment (UCS) standards.  This software will also support emerging Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Universal Ground Control Station (UGCS) and Scalable Control Interface (SCI) requirements.

Current Universal Products consist of the UGCS, the Universal Ground Data Terminal (UGDT) and the Universal Mission Simulator (UMS).  The Universal Products will be capable of flight and payload control of multiple unmanned aircraft systems.  UGCS is protected in a climate-controlled, standard S-280 or S-788 U.S. Army shelter and mounted on either a standard Army FMTV or HMMWV, the UGCS commands multi-UAS missions by controlling flight as well as receiving and disseminating battlefield video and situational awareness data through state-of-the-art operator consoles (UAS Cockpit).  Consoles can be used to provide aircraft command and control, payload control and weapons launch.  Future GCS modifications will allow scaled down sizes of GCS to support expeditionary operations.

The UGDT provides a Line of Sight (LOS) capability for transmit and receipt of UAS command and control and UAS payload products.  The UGDT is the common datalink system for U. S. Army UAS.

The Universal Mission Simulator (UMS) consists of the hardware and software required to fully train UAS operators to full Readiness Level (RL) 1, IAW Army aviation standards.  The UMS will be capable of training and simulating flight and payload control of [Directorate of Simulation (DOS)] Shadow and Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft systems.

The OSRVT Increment II consists of a Remote Operations Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER), Miltope tablet, Antennas, UHF Modem, Type I encryption, Ku-Directional Antennas (KuDA) with an On-The-Move (OTM) capable variant, and an extended range Mobile Directional Antennas System (MDAS). Software supports decoding Telemetry Data from multiple Manned/Unmanned Aircraft Systems, provides Electro-Optical (EO)/Infrared (IR) payload control, and supports off-target calculations. OSRVT supports current operations and emerging requirements.

Justification: FY2020 Universal Product Base funding of $32.016M will be used for continuing the development of modifications needed to address UGCS modernization utilizing MOSA, maintain interoperability, increase commonality for the Family of UAS, Gray Eagle (MQ-1C), and Shadow (RQ-7) programs of record as well as SCI including Systems Engineering, Logistics, and Program Management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The NRE will encompass subsystem integration and will utilize existing test aircraft, incorporate the technical insertions, and initiate appropriate qualification and operational flight-testing.

In FY14, a contract for Apache AH-64E Lot 3, initiating Full Rate Production, was awarded with options for Lot 4.

Training device concurrency will be maintained with each technical insertion. The Engineering/Manufacturing Design (EMD) effort is managed as Cost Reimbursable.
Production efforts will be awarded as Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) and include the Advance Procurement requirements.

In FY13, FY14, and FY15 MRL NRE encompassed US Government (USG) design of the Hydra Launcher Electronics Assembly (LEA), modification of the M261 launcher, launcher fabrication, and launcher testing.

In FY15-FY19, Apache AH-64E Version 6 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Contract. Multi-year production awarded March 15, 2017.

FY 20, the Apache Capabilities Enhancements (ACE) delivers required capability enhancements supported by Apache's Modernization Strategy to ensure AH-64E maintains relevance and dominance throughout its expected service life.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DT2 / Non-MIP Biometrics - Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) Increment 0, also known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS), is an information technology system supporting identity superiority by providing the critical core capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations. BEC Increment 0 is a Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected terrorists across the full range of military operations and preventing terrorist operations. DoD ABIS enables DOD, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions. DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation and improve business practices

The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for
all DoD forensics and biometrics activities. In addition, DFBA is the proponent to establish and maintain Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and
information management support throughout the Armed Services and DoD. DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of
efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities
that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational
effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific
requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:

FY 2020 RDT&amp;E funding in the amount of $0.281 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) supports cyber security testing and preparation for DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) operational testing.
 
FY 2020 funding in the amount of $1.421 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility,
and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA supports the conduct of biometrics and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability
assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DT2 / Non-MIP Biometrics - Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) Increment 0, also known as DoD Automated Biometrics Identification System (DoD ABIS), is an information technology system supporting identity superiority by providing the critical core capability for Warfighters to identify known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals in the course of military operations. BEC Increment 0 is a Program of Record and DoD's only authoritative biometric repository, providing 24/7 operational support for the Warfighter and interagency partners to decide and act in near-real time with timely identification and identity verification of known or suspected terrorists across the full range of military operations and preventing terrorist operations. DoD ABIS enables DOD, Interagency and International Partners to effectively impede adversary's ability to conceal their identity and intentions. DoD ABIS supports all three objectives of the National Defense Strategy to increase lethality, enhance International Cooperation and improve business practices.

Justification:

FY 2020 RDT&amp;E funding in the amount of $0.281 million (DT2: Non-MIP Biometrics) supports cyber security testing and preparation for DoD ABIS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) operational testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Army conducted a fair opportunity competition in FY17 to competitively select the contractor to continue to sustain the system and perform the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Development and Deployment.  The resulting contract for DoD ABIS Sustainment Services and SLEP was awarded on June 30, 2017.  This upgrade is extremely critical in order to replace end of life hardware and software components, including Commercial Off the Shelf products whose versions currently included in DoD ABIS are no longer supported.  The SLEP will extend the service life of the current capability and will improve interoperability with other government entities such as the FBI and DHS.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Defense Forensics and Biometrics Agency (DFBA) under the Provost Marshal General, fulfills the Secretary of the Army's Executive Agent (EA) responsibilities for all DoD forensics and biometrics activities. As the proponent, DFBA supports and provides oversight for Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities and information management throughout the Armed Services and DoD. DFBA leads and facilitates in the development of improvements, and implementation of efficiencies to developed and deployed biometric technologies for Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, DoD, and Agencies; facilitates transition of capabilities that contribute to the enhancement of the biometric community; increases Joint Service interoperability; and empowers the warfighter by improving operational effectiveness on the battlefield. The DFBA strategy pursues technology opportunities through scientific discovery and makes investments responsive to specific requirements identified by combat developers.

Justification:
FY 2020 funding in the amount of $1.421 million for Project DU2 will provide DFBA the ability to actively manage research efforts to ensure scientific merit, feasibility, and DFBA objectives and requirements are met. DFBA supports the conduct of biometric and forensics activities (e.g. standards conformance and interoperability assessments), support to DoD acquisition organizations, and provision of subject matter expertise to DoD and non-DoD government stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Software and hardware improvements for threat evolution:  Performs necessary analysis and development efforts to maintain PATRIOT system effectiveness against evolving threat technologies and specific threat capabilities.  This effort identifies evolving threats and threat characteristics that might present a challenge to PATRIOT's current capabilities and develops initial concepts to maintain system effectiveness relative to these threats.  

Upper-Tier Debris Mitigation (UTDM): Implements algorithms to mitigate system impacts of debris from Upper Tier intercepts associated with operating in the
Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) environment. Debris from Upper Tier intercepts can cause significant radar loading effects and the potential for erroneous
engagements and missile wastage on debris.

Radar Digital Processor (RDP) Waveform Suite: Develops a comprehensive set of waveforms in the RDP to improve PATRIOT radar capabilities against current
and evolving threats, including support to Task 6 and 7 efforts (see below), and implements advanced data collection enabled by the RDP to support further system
improvements. The new waveforms enabled by the RDP allow capability improvements in Discrimination, Combat ID, Electronic Protection, Search, Tracking, and other areas of need.

THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability: Implements improvements to THAAD/PATRIOT Interoperability and addresses Joint Defense Network deficiencies that impact
Tactical Ballistic Missile battle management and force/engagement operations. Efforts will be concentrated on joint, collaborative force operations (defense design and
planning) and enhanced Tactical Digital Information Link - Joint interoperability.

 Advanced Electronic Counter Measures (AECM):  This task investigates the implications of advanced technology Digital Radio Frequency Memory available on airborne platforms that enables new ECM techniques which could adversely affect Air and Missile Defense System effectiveness.   

Task 2:  Implements improved ground system and interceptor capabilities (PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2/Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3, and Missile Segment Enhancement) to counter emerging Tactical Ballistic Missile threats.
 
Task 6:  Software improvements enhance discrimination of higher altitude Tactical Ballistic Missile Re-entry Vehicles (RVs) from associated objects to support the full engagement capabilities of the interceptor.  Longer-range detection, track, and improved high-altitude discrimination are required to achieve the required lethality performance against the RV and to mitigate missile wastage against separation debris.  This task leverages the signal processing capabilities of the Radar Digital Processor, and supports the high altitude engagements required by the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles.

Task 7:  Performs analysis on existing and evolving Tactical Ballistic Missile countermeasures to determine the effects on PATRIOT system effectiveness.  Develops hardware and software concepts to address countermeasure effects to ensure the PATRIOT system maintains its effectiveness.  Develops detailed system requirements to implement concepts; design/code/test software implementation leveraging Radar Digital Processor, Modernized Adjunct Processor, Enhanced Weapons Control Computer - Emulator and Flight Solution Computer-Redesign processing capabilities.  Implements simulation based concepts to define tradespace and establish system requirements.

Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT):  Efforts will develop and test the military's improved Global Position M-Code with PATRIOT Major End Items (MEI) integrating the improved anti-jamming and secure access of military GPS signals.  This effort meets the requirement for Assured PNT through M-Code as mandated by FY2011 National Defense Act, public law 111-383 &amp; 913.

Combat ID Enhancements:  Develop and implement improvements to the Radar Digital Processor-Capability Combat ID capabilities and additional Non-Cooperative Target Recognition techniques to further mitigate misclassification and fratricide risk, and to provide the Warfighter with improved situational awareness.

Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) Asset Defense: Provides improved capability for PATRIOT to protect other Army and Joint Services Sensors from ARM attacks. Builds on
an initial capability provided in Post-Deployment Build-7 by determining remaining gaps, identifying and evaluating alternatives, and implementing further improvements.

Tactical Telemetry Ground Station: Develops a ground-based telemetry receive station to be deployed with the tactical units and collect PAC-3 telemetry data for tactical
engagements. This data will be used to assess missile and system effectiveness in tactical environments against real-world threats, and will support the development of
operational improvements (Firing Doctrine and other system settings) and system software improvements to mitigate stressing threat behaviors.

PAC-3 Seeker Software Improvements:  Perform PAC-3 Missile Segment Software improvements to improve missile capability to counter Electronic Attack Threats.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The design objective of the PATRIOT system was to provide a baseline system capable of modification to cope with continuing threat evolution.  This program minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  The PATRIOT Product Improvement Program upgrades the PATRIOT system to address operational lessons learned, enhancements to joint force interoperability and communications, and other system performance improvements to provide overmatch capability against the emerging threat.  Upgrades are implemented through individual hardware and software materiel changes and fielded incrementally. This program encompasses several changes which will require the use of a variety of acquisition methods to develop, test, procure and field.  Future hardware and software capabilities will be incorporated into future Post Deployment Build (PDB) releases.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>FSC2 supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Efforts:  LOE 2 Common Operating Environment
 
Precision Fires-Dismounted/Mounted (PF-D/M), formerly known as Pocket-sized Forward Entry Device (PFED) Increment II is a software application that operates on the Nett Warrior End User Device (EUD). It will provide the dismounted Forward Observer (FO) and Fire Support Teams (FISTs) the capability and functionality to accurately and rapidly locate ground targets and digitally process a Call For Fire, precision targeting, DACAS and video. PFED Increment II answers the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment requirement that all handheld applications reside on the Nett Warrior EUD. PFED supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Efforts:  LOE 2 Common Operating Environment

Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS program currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction. AFATDS supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Efforts: LOE 2 Common Operating Environment

PF-D/M and AFATDS support Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) CFT Extended Range Canon Artillery (ERCA), Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket
System (ER-GMLRS), Precision Strike Missile System (PRSM) and Projectile Tracking System (PTS) initiatives. To support these LRPF initiatives AFATDS will serve
as the key sensor to shooter link for the Army and USMC providing fully automated support for planning, coordinating, controlling and executing fires and effects.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 18 May 2015, the Milestone Decision Authority (PEO C3T) signed the Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving the PFED Increment II Milestone B. The Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) officially approved entry into the Development phase as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program. The system received a limited deployment decision in Dec 2016 to enter into operational test and subsequently expects to receive full material release in Jan 2018

PF-D/M leverages an Army Science and Technology investment by transitioning a software application that has been developed and used in proponent experimentation events (e.g. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) and Bold Quest). Upon a successful Milestone B decision in FY2015, this software application transitioned to PM Mission Command to conduct all Army developmental and operational test and evaluation requirements. PF-D/M will be integrated onto the Nett Warrior End User Devices (EUDs) and will be fielded by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). Training on the PF-D/M software will be conducted by PM Mission Command as units are fielded the capability.

PM Mission Command will continue to manage future capability blocks of software development. while continuing to coordinate with PM SWAR to field and train future versions of the software, as described above.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7.0 modernizes the existing AFATDS software currently in the field. AFATDS 7.0 enhances the existing AFATDS baseline by: (1) Providing a modernized web service based backend that will simplify long-term maintenance of the software, (2) Bringing AFATDS into full compliance with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) initiative and (3) Enhancing overall usability of the system through the implementation of a role-based capability architecture with embedded training that allows the AFATDS operator to receive on-the-spot training for any aspect of AFATDS via interactive instruction. 
The Army Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) 7.0 funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Efforts:  LOE 2 Common Operating Environment.

FY 2020 funding in the amount of $43.898 million will be used to continue development efforts on AFATDS version 7.0.

PF-D/M and AFATDS support Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) CFT Extended Range Canon Artillery (ERCA), Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket
System (ER-GMLRS), Precision Strike Missile System (PRSM) and Projectile Tracking System (PTS) initiatives. To support these LRPF initiatives AFATDS will serve
as the key sensor to shooter link for the Army and USMC providing fully automated support for planning, coordinating, controlling and executing fires and effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>On 13 May 2015, the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) determined that a modernization of the existing Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) software code is required to comply with Army Common Operating Environment (COE) standards to be executed as AFATDS 7.0. In V7.0, the PM will re-design AFATDS to provide the operator role/duty-based interaction, a dynamic embedded training capability, integration of COE compliant architectures and allowance for more efficient insertion of future capabilities.

Development of future AFATDS capabilities will be considered based on requirements approved through the Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) Tactical Software Requirements Governance Board.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds development efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2).  PE Number 0203735A/Project FD8 funds the development of LAV25 enhancements.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) corrects vehicle deficiencies identified during Army operations; continues technical system upgrades to include the integration of applicable technologies on ground systems; addresses needed evolutionary enhancements to tracked combat vehicles; and develops technology improvements which have application to or insertion opportunities across multiple Ground Combat Systems vehicles.  This PE provides combat effectiveness and Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost reduction enhancements for the Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Stryker Family of Vehicles (FOVs) through a series of product improvements.

The strategy for Abrams and Bradley will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future.  This effort was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.  

The Recovery Vehicle Improvement program is a group of ECPs that will allow the current recovery vehicle to regain Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle. The current M88A2 is not capable of Single Vehicle Recovery of the M1A2 SEPv2 in all situations and the M1A2C (formerly M1A2 SEPv3) fielding in FY 2020 will further exacerbate the recovery problem.

The Abrams M1A2 SEP V2 and M2/M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles are at or exceed Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations.  In order to host and restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle programs will execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development under other existing Programs of Record.  The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams and Bradley Platforms.

M113 improvements will develop an affordable solution for upgrading the M113s to enhance protection, survivability, mobility and power generation to support the current and future network systems.  This will provide the necessary enhancements to the M113 capability for Echelons Above Brigade (EAB) units with priority to the forward deployed units and equipment sets.  The Armored Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program will replace all M113 family of vehicles in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCT).

Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY 2020. The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporate a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture.

Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This directly supports the expeditionary maneuver excursion conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY 2017- FY 2018.  The Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will also execute a Company-size LAV-25 excursion that will inform the development of initial Company Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) to be utilized during the FY 2020 Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) Soldier Vehicle Assessment (SVA).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HERCULES), designated as an ACAT IC program on 15 Jun 2016, has been providing towing, winching, and hoisting operations to support battlefield recovery operations and evacuation of heavy tanks and other tracked combat vehicles since its production and deployment in 1998. The HERCULES recovers tanks mired to different depths, removes M1 Abrams turrets and power packs, and uprights overturned heavy combat vehicles. Currently, the M88A2 is unable to safely perform Single Vehicle Recovery (SVR) of the Abrams tank in all conditions, due to added weight/survivability improvements made to the tank. In order to ensure SVR is met, Project Director- Main Battle Tank Systems (PD-MBTS) will develop and integrate ECP technologies for the M88A2 HERCULES through an Operations and Support (O&amp;S) initiative to meet its operational requirements of SVR throughout its life cycle. This initiative is not intended to exceed current operational capability, but will instead regain SVR capability of the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.

Analyses conducted to date suggests that upgrades to the M88A2 track, suspension, hydraulics, engine, transmission and other related components are required to meet single vehicle recovery for the heaviest tracked combat vehicle.

FY 2020 Base dollars will continue the design, development, integration, prototype build, as well as pay government salaries. The prototype vehicles will enter testing in FY 2021 to confirm technical solutions meet performance requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army has approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) for the Abrams Main Battle Tank to restore lost capability, host inbound technologies, and to meet objective performance requirements called out in approved platform requirements documents. The strategy for Abrams will focus on incrementally delivering capability to the warfighter to meet both near-term limitations as well as mitigating gaps and maintaining combat overmatch in the future. This approach was approved by the Army Acquisition Executive in 3Q FY 2011.

The Abrams vehicle is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) limitations. In order to restore lost platform capability, the Abrams Tank will execute a series of ECPs to support the current embedded systems and to facilitate integration of technologies currently in development. The ECPs are not intended to exceed the operational capability outlined in current system requirements documents, but rather to ensure that the existing system performance is not further degraded and that Army mission equipment packages can be integrated on the Abrams. The ECPs will incorporate lost power generation and distribution technologies, force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection Systems, technologies to mitigate obsolescence issues, in-bound technologies under development technologies to decrease the overall weight of the tank, and technologies in support of any validated Army requirement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Abrams SEP V4 program consists of lethality improvements.  The primary focus is the integration of 3GEN Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and the integration of Ammunition Data Link (ADL) for the Advanced Multi-purpose (AMP) round.  Additional improvements to the target acquisition sensors consist of inclusion of color cameras, laser capabilities, and image processing improvements.  Other potential improvements consist of an improved environmental control system, laser warning receiver, vehicle smoke generation, survivability enhancements, signature management improvements, embedded training enhancements, 360 degree situational awareness cameras, and weight reduction efforts.  Trade studies, analysis and technology maturation will be performed to evaluate prospective improvements, along with obsolescence mitigation, and incorporation of inbound technologies currently under development.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Bradley Family of Vehicles is at or exceeds Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWAP-C) limitations. To restore lost platform capability and to host other Army existing program of records, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle program shall execute a series of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). The track and suspension ECP improves the vehicle's track and suspension while the Bradley A4 (Mobility) ECP improves the power train and electrical system to enable the Bradley fleet to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including mission command systems. The Bradley A4 development effort led to a production decision in FY 2017.  Product Manager Bradley will characterize a Non Developmental Item (NDI) to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats to include, but not limited to Active Protection System. A separate integration effort began in FY 2018 for an underbelly armor kit for improved survivability against blast threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Track and Suspension ECP production contract was awarded in FY 2014, and began fielding in FY 2015. Bradley A4 development has been executed on a sole source cost plus incentive fee contract to the current platform Original Equipment Manufacturer. Bradley A4 (Mobility) ECP is scheduled to begin fielding in FY 2020 to address powertrain and electrical power upgrades, which will enable the vehicle to host inbound technologies from Army program of records, including mission command systems, with no further performance degradation to the vehicle. Product Manager Bradley will characterize a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Active Protection System in order to develop force protection and survivability improvements to counter evolving threats.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>PE Number 0203735A/Project EE2 funds development efforts for the Stryker Double V-Hull A1 (DVH A1) Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) (formerly named Stryker ECP 1), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) (formerly named Stryker ONS Lethality), Stryker Survivability Enhancements, and Stryker Lethality ECPs (formerly referred to as Stryker ECP 2).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Stryker Improvement will address the development of Lethality, Survivability, Mobility, and Communication, Command and Control (C3) improvements within the Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV). Principal development efforts include upgrades associated with the Stryker Double V-Hull (DVH) A1 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), Stryker 30mm Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) Operational Needs Statement (ONS), Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J) ONS, Stryker Survivability Enhancement, and Stryker Lethality ECPs.  DVH A1 ECP power generation, suspension, and network upgrades restores Stryker DVH Space, Weight, and Power-Cooling (SWaP-C) lost as a result of incorporating vehicle changes to counter threats encountered during deployment operations while allowing the future network to be hosted without further degradation in vehicle protection and mobility. The Stryker 30mm ICVD and CROWS-J ONS efforts addressed Urgent Operational Need to increase the firepower of Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) within the US Army European Command (USAREUR). The 30mm ICVD ONS effort integrates a 30mm-equipped weapon station providing, USAREUR with precision direct firepower to overwhelm the enemy in encounter actions and suppressive fire to preserve mounted and dismounted freedom of movement. The Stryker Survivability Enhancement will address evolving threats by assessing survivability improvements, to include passive protection systems, active protection systems, and an under-armor fire capability for Stryker-equipped reconnaissance troops. Stryker Lethality ECP efforts focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon ECP, CROWS-J ECP, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ECP, common masted sensor ECP, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and address Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and Modified Improved Target Acquisitions System (MITAS) obsolescence issues that will impact fleet sustainment beginning in FY 2020. The ATGM ECP will upgrade the MITAS, incorporate a far target locator and disseminate target acquirement information utilizing network lethality, providing a common operating picture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>23 March 2018 Army Requirements Oversight Council decision to exchange all remaining flat-bottom brigades results in continuing exchange production beginning in FY 2018 funded in Stryker Upgrade (G85200). Stryker MOD (GM0100) supports Stryker Fleet modifications to include Infantry Carrier Vehicle Dragoon (ICVD) production and fielding in FY 2016-2018  and Lethality ECP retrofits in FY 2019-2023.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Stryker Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) 1 effort will buy back the vehicle space, weight, and power margin lost due to the addition of numerous kits in response to eleven years of war (20-combat rotations &amp; 37+ million total miles), in order to allow integration of the future network (as directed by VCSA in August 2011) without further degrading the performance of the platform.  In May 2012, Stryker ECP 1 program (Phase I) was approved, permitting preliminary design and integration efforts on both the Flat Bottom (FB) and Double-V Hull (DVH) variants.  In March 2013, Phase II was approved continuing design and integration of ECP 1 mechanical power, electrical power generation, chassis upgrades, and the in-vehicle network upgrades.  Based on additional testing conducted in the summer of 2013, the decision was made to focus ECP 1 efforts on the DVH platform and defer efforts on flat-bottom Strykers.  The effort has subsequently been renamed the Stryker DVH A1 ECP.  The DVH A1 ECP Phase II contract, awarded November 25, 2013, continues development engineering, prototype build test and evaluation.  The initial DVH A1 ECP production contract was awarded in October 2016 (Sole-Source Firm Fixed Price arrangement).  A second and third buy of DVH A1 ECP vehicles was awarded as a Fixed Price Incentive Fee arrangement.

On July 2, 2015, ASARC authorization was granted to execute the Stryker 30mm ICVD Operational Needs Statement (ONS) effort.  30mm ICVD Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contracts for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and Logistics Products Development/Test Support were awarded in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively (Cost Plus Incentive-Fee basis).  The 30mm ICVD ONS Production/Retrofit contract was awarded in May 2016 through an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).  Definitization of the Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) Production contract occurred in March 2017.

The Stryker Lethality ECP efforts will focus on the integration of a suite of complementary Mission Equipment Package (MEP) lethality upgrades (medium caliber weapon system, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station-Javelin (CROWS-J), common masted sensor, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) target acquisition optics, and other capabilities) that will improve the suppressive fire and armored vehicle engagement capabilities across the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) approval to initiate the Stryker CROWS-J ECP and ATGM ECP efforts was received in a September 30, 2016 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). A medium caliber weapon decision is planned for February 2019.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will design, test and modify two Light Armored Vehicles (LAV-25A2s) for Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) to inform operational concepts for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) in support of Global Response Force early entry operations.  This directly supports the expeditionary maneuver excursion conducted by the XVIII Airborne Corps in FY 2017- FY 2018. 

The Light Armored Vehicle improvement program will also execute a Company-size LAV-25 excursion that will inform the development of initial Company Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) to be utilized during the FY 2020 Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) Soldier Vehicle Assessment (SVA).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The current Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) is an ACAT1C Acquisition program. The PIM improvement program is intended to address the current Howitzer capability gap based on a capability needs assessment performed by the user community to restore indirect fires support overmatch to the US Army. This effort will evaluate developing technologies to determine which configuration will add optimal value to the Army. This effort will consist of multiple increments to spiral technology as it matures and may include, but is not limited, to the integration of a new cannon, gun mount, gun drive systems, fire control systems, autoloader, and optionally-manned capability into the M109A7 Howitzer. Analysis will be required to evaluate the impact of the new cannon technology and modifications required to support ammunition automation, remote firing, and remote movement on current platform chassis, cab, suspension, mobility, and electronic architecture. This evaluation will be the foundation to inform the level of effort needed to integrate this capability into the current SPHS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Conducted a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) comparing several different packages of upgrades for the M109A7.  Each upgrade package was evaluated for cost, technology readiness and added performance.  At the conclusion of the CBA the Army was better informed to choose a path which can be sole source with the current vendor, open competition, or continue with government development through Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD).  This work effort was to pursue Objective Indirect Fire Range Requirement in the current M109 FOV Capability Production Document (CPD).  The effort addressed increased range requirements from a holisitic development process.  Program focused on gun mount, breech, tube, and fire control.  It was designed around M109A7 objective requirements for range. It is intended to address capability gaps as identified by the Army Chief of Staff.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005. Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD) was approved 14 Mar 2009.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE) on 12 Jun 2015.

The RDTE funded elements for GPS Denied, Alternate Munitions Integration, Survivability, and Propulsion Reliability addressed in this submission are planned for award on the Gray Eagle Technical Services contract as a Technical Services Memorandum (TSM) task order, and as Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requisitions (MIPRs) to various other Government Agencies. The purpose of the TSMs are to mature the respective designs to a level that Engineering Change Requests (ECR) are submitted to the Government via the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Following successful completion of the TSM and CCB approval, a contract modification to retrofit and/or cut-in the respective engineering change will be awarded on the appropriate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) or production contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Army Futures Command provides a unique opportunity and a corresponding requirement to fully integrate and synchronize decision support data from across the modernization domain including key processes such as requirements (JCIDS / CARDS), resource programming (PPBE / AE2S and cProbe), Force Management (BOIP Development/FMS/AOS Data) synchronization will ensure an on demand Structure and Composition System (SACS) File, capability to plan, project, and in the current year see and understand equipment demand changes and respond efficiency.  Synchronization and integration of FM systems (requirements) with AE2S (Resources) will enable this. This is also key enabler of Dynamic Force Employment as outlined in the 2019 National Defense Strategy. Acquisition (ACWS), financial execution (GFEBS) and systems sustainment (AESIP/ LIW).  The major efforts included in the program element are: 1) Integration and synchronization of the Army's interoperability efforts; between joint and multi-national forces, combat materiel, and training efforts. 2) Systems engineering and integration of programmed and prioritized force structure data to digitize the modernization life-cycle from requirements, through PPBE, to divestiture.  3) Further develop Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S) to support the Army Modernization enterprise to include Army Futures Command and other Headquarters elements. 

Digitization efforts are in support of the Army Equipping Strategy, National Defense Authorization Act 804, and OSD reports to Congress.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project allows the Army to further develop improved business practices as it relates to automation, transparency, and auditability, and collaboration.  This project includes the funding of ongoing improvement to the Army Equipping Enterprise System (AE2S).  AE2S provides the Army staff the ability to execute its planning, programming, budget, and execution (PPBE) mission as it pertains to equipment procurement and fielding.  AE2S aggregates authoritative data from multiple Army databases to provide a common operating picture for the Army staff to use in developing funding and fielding solutions for the Army's equipment.  It is the tool that Army senior leaders use to develop, review, and approve equipment funding positions.  It is used extensively to answer congressional inquiries regarding equipment funding, unit on-hand quantities, projected fielding, and Transparency.  This project allows the Army to improve its data architecture and software across systems in order to ensure accurate data is presented appropriately within AE2S.  Additionally, this program element funds various Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) projects that provide system engineering expertise to provide unbiased advice, formulate course of actions, analyze programs and make technical support and process recommendations to create efficiencies and improve systems. Specifically, these FFRDC projects support financial system and process improvement, equipment management and data visualization, equipment fill projections and automation recommendations.  Funding provides independent technical analysis, special studies, and acquisition process improvement. In accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 804 and support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) report to Congress, the Army is poised to implement an incremental approach to software development and hardware/software capability integration. This process will improve effectiveness in the management of resources, synchronization of programs and improve the auditability of funding to equipment delivery improving transparency and predictability in the equipping process.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The Avenger's mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Fixed Wing (FW) Aircraft, Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.

The Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP) consists of Project 038: Avenger Production Improvement Program (PIP) and Program Element CE8710: Avenger MODS. FY 2020 funding of $1.287 million ensures that Avenger is viable and sustainable through the end of program life. Avenger MOD-SLEP maintains operational capability of Avenger until FY 2031.  

The Stinger missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, shoulder-fired and platform mounted guided missile that provides the maneuver force and point defense assets air defense protection. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against FW, RW, UAS and CM. The Stinger missile is deployable from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters, UAS and Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

Stinger Product Improvement completes the design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.

Stinger Product Improvement also includes the following efforts: redesign of Stinger missile components to address obsolescence and improve performance; integration of the Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU) onto the Stinger MANPADS to improve target acquisition capabilities; and redesign of Stinger Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS) to address obsolescence.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Avenger Air Defense System is a lightweight, ground-to-air missile and gun weapon system mounted on a High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle. The Avenger's mission is to protect fixed critical assets and Corps/Echelons above Corps Maneuver forces from Fixed Wing (FW) Aircraft, Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). Avenger provides day/night adverse weather operations, shoot on the move capability, rapid target engagement, and remote firing capability.

Avenger PIP consists of the ongoing Avenger Modification - Service Life Extension Program (MOD-SLEP). Avenger MOD-SLEP provides development and testing of six key components to ensure Avenger maintains operational capability through FY 2031. The six components are: Targeting Console (TC), .50 Caliber Machine Gun (M3P), Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), Vehicle Internal Communications (VIC-5) and the Environmental Control Unit/Prime Power Unit (ECU/PPU) governor and starter. 

FY 2020 Base dollars in the amount of $1.287 million supports activities to ensure the Avenger is viable and sustainable through FY 2031. The funding will complete the Materiel Release package for the AFCC, IFF, VIC-5 and ECU/PPU governor and starter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Stinger missile is an advanced, fire-and-forget, short-range, man-portable, shoulder-fired and platform mounted guided missile that provides the maneuver force and point defense assets air defense protection. Stinger's mission is to provide the force with low-altitude air defense against Fixed Wing (FW) and Rotary Wing (RW) Aircraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles (CM). The Stinger missile is deployable from a variety of platforms that includes vehicles, helicopters, UAS and Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). The missile is delivered as a certified round and requires no field testing or maintenance.

Stinger Product Improvement completes the design, development, test and integration of the Proximity Fuze (PROX) and addresses obsolescence. This will make PROX available for incorporation into the existing Stinger Block I missile. The PROX will improve effectiveness by eliminating the need for a hit-to-kill against UAS threats. UAS defense is a requirement of the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the Stinger Guided Missile System and validated by the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Current and Future Warfighting Capabilities Division (DAMO-CIC) in a memo dated 28 May 2013.

Stinger Product Improvement also provides for the following efforts: redesign of Stinger missile components to address obsolescence and improve performance; integration of the Javelin Lightweight Command Launch Unit (CLU) with the Stinger MANPADS to improve target acquisition capabilities; and redesign of Stinger Training Aids, Devices, Simulators and Simulations (TADSS)  to address obsolescence.

Stinger Product Improvement does not have FY 2020 funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In FY 2012, the Stinger Based Systems (SBS) Product Office utilized Picatinny Arsenal to award the PROX development contract for the design, development, test and integration of the PROX capability. This capability will be incorporated into the existing Stinger Block I missile SLEP.

Using FY 2018 funds, the SBS Product Office utilizes an Other Transactional Authority (OTA) with Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOT-C) for the redesign of Stinger missile components to address obsolescence.  The SBS Product Office used an existing contract through Joint Attack Munitions Systems (JAMS) Project Office for the Javelin Lightweight CLU integration.  The SBS Product Office used the existing Stinger Engineering Services contract to redesign TADSS to address obsolescence.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety &amp; Occupational Health is the designated Executive Agent for the Environmental Information Technology Management (EITM) program. Defined by the DoD Directive 4715.1E, the EITM mission is to ensure efficient use of enterprise environment, safety, and occupational health (ESOH) corporate information management processes by providing and sustaining requirement-driven ESOH corporate data management, Congressional-reporting, and public outreach tools to the DoD, and other DoD stakeholders. Funding provided for this program will allow EITM to continue to develop and modernize the platform to meet Army and DoD policy-driven cloud computing and cybersecurity requirements. Prior to funding being committed, DoD ESOH stakeholders and authoritative information technology organizations were consulted to determine necessary system interface upgrades to be incorporated. Expanding DENIX's architecture to create a Level 2 container separate from the current Level 4 container will not only provide a more secure, cybersecurity risk-adverse environment, but it will also optimize performance, capabilities, and mandatory reporting for ESOH stakeholders using a PaaS delivery model. This phased solution begins in FY 2018 by prototyping of system architecture optimization that improves user experience, enabling web conferencing in FY 2019 and applying machine learning concepts to improve data quality in FY 2020-2022.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The PATRIOT system includes a family of hardware, software, interceptors (PAC-2, Guidance Enhanced Missiles, PAC-3 and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement) and Ground Support Equipment. As software and hardware improvements are developed, there is a continuing need for system level modeling, simulation, integration and testing. Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) allow for performance assessment against all threats that would not be possible in flight tests due to cost, target and range constraints. Flight testing is periodically required for validation of the Modeling and Simulation as well as satisfying Army Test and Evaluation Command/Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (ATEC/DOTE) requirements of segment improvements. The Lower Tier AMD System line also supports identification, analysis, design, and test materiel solutions to counter cyber security and electronic warfare shortcomings to all elements of the Lower Tier Battle Space.

PATRIOT is an integral part of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Architecture and enables the incremental fielding of the system capability for Army Air and Missile Defense Battalions.

FY 2020 base dollars in the amount of $107.746 million supports the continuance of program development with the integration of missile and ground system software and hardware in support of complete Post Deployment Build-8.1 (PDB-8.1). Continues the testing program to support the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) and system testing/analysis long lead activities for PDB-8.1 Development Test and Evaluation (DTE) and Limited User Test (LUT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The ongoing design and developmental activities enable modeling and simulation infrastructure maintenance and upgrades coupled with end to end testing of the Lower Tier architecture against the evolving threat as an element of an integrated Air and Missile Defense system. This strategy minimizes technological risks and provides a means of enhancing system capability through planned upgrades of deployed systems.  Lower Tier system development efforts enable further improvement of system capabilities against emerging and reactive threats.  Developing, fabricating and testing hit to kill surface to air missile and associated ground support equipment provides essential increases in battle space, accuracy, lethality and firepower to counter and destroy evolving air defense threats. These state-of-the-art capabilities and enhancements require ongoing demonstration through a series of flight tests and modeling and simulation activities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>GMLRS rockets are surface-to-surface artillery rockets fired from the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers. GMLRS rockets provide 24/7, all-weather precision fires to engage both area and point targets at short, medium, and long ranges.  The GMLRS Program currently consists of multiple variants: GMLRS Unitary utilizes a 200 pound high explosive warhead to engage point targets with limited collateral damage; GMLRS Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) cluster munition to engage area or imprecisely located targets and GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) which has been developed as a non-cluster munition to engage the same target set as GMLRS DPICM. GMLRS DPICM Production was terminated in response to the June 2008 Department of Defense (DoD) Cluster Munitions Policy. GMLRS Unitary and AW are currently in full rate production.

The 26 October 2016 Deputy Secretary's Management Action Group (DMAG) directed the Army to define and execute an effort for GMRLS modifications that would extend the maximum range and integrate sensors and seekers into the rocket.  These shall be modifications to GMLRS, not new start efforts.  Both the existing EG2 and EG3 tasks received augmented funding to pursue these modifications.  

The GMLRS program will continue to leverage ongoing Government and Industry research and development efforts to extend range, increase survivability, and enhance lethality.  The EG2 funding line will enable the seeker modification.  The EG3 funding line enables GMLRS enhancements, including Extended Range (ER) GMLRS modification, statutorily required upgrades, and  obsolescence mitigation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army initially funded the development of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) increment under the EG2 - GMLRS Alternative Warheads project code. GMLRS AW entered full rate production in 2015. The 26 October 2016 Deputy Secretary's Management Action Group (DMAG) directed the Army to define and execute an effort for a GMLRS modification that would integrate an advanced seeker into the rocket.

Funding identified in FY 2020 - FY 2022 will support the technology transition, development, and demonstration of an advanced seeker into the GMLRS and will help define a common seeker solution for the entire MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM). The advanced seeker program will leverage the Extended Range (ER) GMLRS and culminate in a proof of concept demonstration of the advanced seeker capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army continues to explore ways to enhance Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets and common components and to mitigate obsolescence issues under the Guided MLRS project code. The Army is requesting funding for the following GMLRS Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) activities: (1) evaluation of enhanced operational capabilities to provide more flexibility across the target set to include increased range, flight performance, and end-game optimization; (2) investigation of potential life cycle cost savings through obsolescence initiatives and second source qualification; (3) development of enhancements to the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) common test equipment; (4) evaluation and development of technologies to enhance overall product performance and survivability to include Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT); and (5) system test and evaluation.

The FY 2020 dollars in the amount of $127.028 million will continue the design, qualification, and testing of an extended range variant of the GMLRS; and continue qualification of key rocket obsolescence upgrades.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Project EG3 is intended to support, investigate, and develop alternative material changes to improve the GMLRS family of munitions as they are identified by the material developer or combat developer. This project also supports Insensitive Munitions (IM) activities to improve the overall posture of the system down to component level.
The Extended Range (ER) GMLRS effort is pursuing a strategy of modifying the current GMLRS system through the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process in order to increase its range. ER GMLRS is a development and qualification effort performed as a modification to the current GMLRS, leveraging existing contract vehicles where practicable.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information Systems Security Program funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1, Unified Network.

Project 491: Information Assurance (IA) Development supports the implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army by providing COMSEC system capabilities through encryption, trusted software or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specific systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks. This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates Cyber Security (CS)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan (AMSP).  

IA Development funding implements and establishes functional and technical boundaries of cryptographic, key management and IA capabilities in coordination with the NSA, the DISA, and Joint Services, to secure National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI). Technical evaluations assess the security, operational effectiveness and network interoperability of advanced concept technologies to develop policies, standards, and fundamental building blocks for Army COMSEC capabilities that reduce the risk of future material solutions that could underperform and disrupt classified operations. Develop and publish the COMSEC Implementation Planning Guidance to identify, standardize, and govern the insertion of CS capabilities to bridge operational gaps and support the DoD and NSA mandated requirements to enhance network capacity while providing for secure information exchange of voice, video, and data in accordance with the Army Network Campaign Plan. This will be accomplished by interoperability evaluation, standards testing, and CS, System of System Network Vulnerability Assessments (SoS NVA) for Army Capability Sets for CS/COMSEC capabilities that provide protections for tactical and fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks.

The Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) program provides initial capabilities that enable passive and active cyberspace defense operations to preserve friendly cyberspace capabilities and protect data, networks, net-centric capabilities, and other designated systems. Big Data Pilot provides an advanced analytics capability capable of ingesting structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from multiple data sources (e.g., Joint Regional Security Stacks (JRSS), intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, network device log files, trouble tickets, firewalls, proxies, web and applications server log files, etc) and proves situational awareness of cyberspace battlefield. It provides the computer network defense provider with common analytic platform which informs and reduces risk associated with future material solutions and forms a blueprint for future Big Data Analytics. Big Data (analysis-of-all DoD Information Network sensor data) provides two optimized and accredited clusters deployed in support of JRSS and Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) with a tools suite accessible to Cyber Mission Forces via secure remote access. The Army's DCO activities are a construct of active cyberspace defenses which provide synchronized, real-time capability to discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats to and vulnerability of DoD networks and systems.

Project DV4 &amp; DV5: COMSEC is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. The Army's Mission Command Network Modernization implementation Plan, date 17 April 2018, states that LOE 1 to be a Unified Network which includes the attributes of being, "Protected, Resilient, Survivable" (p. 11) COMSEC is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to achieve LOE 1.

Project DV4: The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the NSA KMI ACAT IAM program, automating the functions of COMSEC electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute Cryptographic data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems. The AKMI System of Systems (SoS) systems components are the Management Client (MGC), Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of fill devices. The AKMS SoS components are the Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS), ACES, and Simple Key Loader (SKL).

Project DV5: The Army COMSEC program supports using NSA developed COMSEC technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into National Security Systems (NSS), and National Security Information (NSI)systems in support of securing the Army network (which is made up of tactical and enterprise networks). This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems. The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks. The cited work is consistent with SPG and the AMSP.

Project ET9: Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) program was cancelled FY 2018. No FY 2020 funding is requested.

Project FF8: User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Project DV4, Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enablers Functions.

Communications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. The Army's Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan states that LOE 1 to be a Unified Network which includes the attributes of being, "Protected, Resilient, Survivable" which Communications Security (COMSEC) is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to achieve LOE 1. KMI is foundational to the Army's Network Enabling Functions (Key Management Infrastructure).

The Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency's (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM program. AKMI supports Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) Net Centric and Cryptographic Modernization Initiatives (CMI) and supports emerging requirements transitioned from the Army Key Management System (AKMS). AKMI automates the functions of Communications Security (COMSEC) electronic key management, control, planning, and distribution. AKMI supports the Army's ability to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks by limiting adversarial access to, and reducing the vulnerability of, Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) systems.

The AKMI Program includes the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family of devices to include the NGLD Small, Medium and Large. AKMI provides an integrated, operational environment that brings essential key management functions in-band. Objective AKMI will leverage NSA KMI program to provide secure software provisioning, will support legacy and modern End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s, simplifies all aspects of key provisioning and ECU management with traceability to individuals, expands operations to DoD unclassified networks, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Coalition users, automates manual business processes to increase Soldier efficiency, transforms key delivery from manual to an automate enterprise service and will provide an Over the Network Keying (OTNK) capability to support CMI.

One of the major enhancement in the AKMI architecture is the ability to leverage the various capabilities and services from NSA KMI. The end state for the Army is to leverage AKMI capabilities (OTNK, Mission Plan/Mission Support System (MP/MSS), Delivery Only Client (DOC), Client Host Only (CHO)) to increase automation, reduce soldier oversight, manage, and deliver key products to the tactical edge up through strategic ECU's. The objective AKMI capabilities will be found in all of the products across the AKMI product line to include MGC, ACES and NGLD family of fill devices. NGLD family will be an enduring solution to bridge the gap until legacy ECUs are fully modernized.

The Next Generation Load Device - Medium (NGLD-M) is scheduled to replace the AN/PYQ-10A and AN/PYQ-10A(C), Simple Key Loader (SKL). The NGLD-M will conduct the Army's key fill mission by issuing, filling, and managing Cryptographic keys to both legacy and future KMI aware End-Cryptographic Units (ECUs). This technology requires RDT&amp;E investment to meet the requirements outlined in the NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD). This effort is proposed as an Acquisition Category III (ACAT III). Program of Record (POR). Testing of this device will also require development funds and culminate in a user test during FY22. 

The NGLD-Medium (NGLD-M) is reliant on the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE), a new KMI-compliant cryptographic engine that is currently being developed by CERDEC S&amp;TCD. This product culminates in a government owned technical data package supporting Cryptographic Modernization requirements. The NGLD-M is a key transition partner for this technology. Further uses of this product are anticipated across Army and other services require reprogrammable Cryptographic requirements. NSA certification is expected during FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>RESCUE creates a secure, reprogrammable cryptographic engine in providing Cryptographic Modernized Capabilities including future Over the Network Keying (OTNK) to Fill Devices and End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s. Fill Devices and ECUs will receive, authenticate, and decrypt OTNK messages and increase WarFighter survivability by minimizing the need for Soldiers to travel to obtain keys. Additionally, Cryptographic Modernization decreases probability of key compromise and therefore, network survivability. Redesign and developmental efforts using modern and readily available components for use in the Army's Next Generation Load Devices (NGLDs) are currently underway. NGLD ? M  will also address requirements codified in the NGLD CPD and the AKMI CPD that were technologically unachievable with the legacy KOV 21 card as used in the Army?s SKL.</r2:Description>

B96004: Key Management Infrastructure (OPA2)
153140: ISSP (TSEC-AKMS) (OMA)</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) is a Non Program of Record (POR) under Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E). AKMI is the Army's implementation of the National Security Agency (NSA) Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) ACAT IAM Program of Record. The AKMI will allow the Army to manage, control, plan, and distribute electronic key for the ~1.5M End Cryptographic Units (ECU)s necessary to communicate and distribute data on the Army's tactical and strategic networks.

AKMI initial Army Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) was approved 2QFY12. The AKMI Program will include the Management Clients (MGC) nodes, Automated Communications Engineering Software (ACES) and Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family. Each component of the AKMI Program is in a different phase of the acquisition cycle.

The NSA KMI Program is replacing the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) program. As the DoD Key Management Lead, NSA is dictating the change from EKMS to KMI by a sunset date of December 2017. Components of the AKMI Program will be retained and adapted from the legacy AKMS program while others will be developed and fielded to meet AKMI requirements.

The NGLD family of devices will become the primary Army Tier 3 component of the AKMI Program. The NGLD Capability Production Document (CPD) was signed 4QFY13. The NGLD CPD calls for a family of 3 devices (small, medium and large) to meet the AKMI requirements. The AKMI program has partnered with RDECOM CERDEC to develop a KMI compliant cryptographic engine, the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE). The NGLD-M will undergo full-and-open competition for development, production, and sustainment during FY19 with a projected FY20 award. NGLD-M development will be conducted during FY20-22 culminating in NSA certification and an operational event. NGLD-M projects LRIP and FRP during FY22.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project DV5, Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enablers Functions.

Communications Security (COMSEC) is governed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSA) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army communications systems are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. Crypto Modernization necessitates the utilization of the latest NSA cryptographic capabilities in order to defeat adversarial efforts to decrypt, disrupt, or exploit US Army networks. The Army's Mission Command Network Modernization Implementation Plan states that LOE 1 to be a Unified Network which includes the attributes of being, "Protected, Resilient, Survivable" which Communications Security (COMSEC) is the Army's implementation of NSA protections to achieve LOE 1.  Crypto Modernization is foundational to the Army's LOE 1: Network Enabling Functions.

This program supports using National Security Agency (NSA) developed Communications Security (COMSEC) technologies within the Army providing encryption, trusted software, or standard operating procedures, and integrating these mechanisms into specified systems in support of securing the Army Tactical and Enterprise Networks.  

This entails architecture studies, system integration and testing, developing installation kits, and certification and accreditation of Automation Information Systems.  The program assesses, develops and integrates emerging Information Assurance (IA)/COMSEC tools (hardware and software) which provide protection for fixed infrastructure post, camp, and station networks as well as tactical networks.  The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.

The Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is designed to investigate Courses Of Action, conduct a Material Solution Analysis, and execute upgrade activities to ensure all enduring Army communications and data equipment that employ embedded cryptographic hardware will utilize modern cryptographic algorithms and keys.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>The program will continue the testing and evaluation of COMSEC devices to confirm capability and interoperability on Army networks and tactical systems as well as identifying risk areas for compliance with COMSEC regulations and procedures. The program will test and evaluate Crypto Systems compliant devices, Suite B IPSec devices built on commercial standards, CHVP, CSfC Guidance, and new software releases to HAIPE 4.X devices in accordance with AR 700-142 Rapid Action Revision dated October 16, 2008. The program tests interoperability and provides ways to insert data at rest (DAR) and data in transit (DIT) technology within the existing and future network infrastructure. Additionally, this program evaluates performance of technologies and provides direction to ensure the lowest impact on performance while providing the greatest protection from loss of sensitive data.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project ET9, Embedded Crypto Modernization (Crypto Mod) supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Lines of Effort (LOE) 1 Network Enablers Functions.

Modernize the AN/ARC-201D Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS) to meet CJCSI mandated cryptographic requirements through the execution of an engineering change effort to provide a bridging radio solution for Army Aviation rotary wing platforms. Support the Unified Network key near term imperative of achieving air-ground integration. Crypto modernization will ensure compliance with Key Management Infrastructure (KMI), add algorithms that address cyber vulnerabilities, improve 'secure but unclassified' network support, and provide better support to coalition interoperability.

Embedded Cryptographic Modernization Initiative (ECMI) is an upgrade activity that will ensure Army radios remain secure by operating with modern cryptographic algorithms. Tactical radios using legacy embedded cryptographic systems will no longer be able to communicate securely after cease key dates documented in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff instruction (CJCSI) 6510. In order to ensure Warfighters continue to have secured communications (i.e., encrypted data and voice), Army tactical radios are required to support modern cryptographic capabilities by implementing modern algorithms. If cease key dates are not met, the Army will be forced to communicate at risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>User activity monitoring (UAM) automation/analytics will provide technical capability to enhance Army UAM analysis effectiveness and efficiency. The UAM mission is to observe and record the actions and activities of an individual, at any time, on any device accessing Army information on classified networks in order to detect insider threats and to support authorized investigations. Army UAM is a component of the Army Insider Threat (InT) Program. Army's InT Program and UAM are conducted in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, section 922., Insider Threat Detection; Presidential Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, dated 21 November 2012; Executive Order 13587, Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, (Reference b) dated 7 October 2011, and Army Directive 2013-18 (Army Insider Threat Program), 31 July 2013. Innovative enhancements are required to improve UAM analysis productivity, data visualization, and workflow management. The analysis productivity objective is to develop and implement user behavior models that use UAM and other network data to identify anomalous user behavior over time, and to integrated new data sources into the UAM analytical data store and processing system. Data visualization advances will present UAM analysts behavior model processing results in an intuitive format that reduce the time required to review the results. Workflow management improvements will add new capabilities to the UAM workflow management system with the objective of enhancing analysis reporting productivity and metrics collection.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle for Defense Business Systems.  The DODI 5000.75 supersedes DODI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across the DOD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in the DODI 5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed" and replace DODI 5000.02 "Milestones."</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) program has two components; a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component provided by the Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP) Hub. The GCSS-Army program, coupled with AESIP, are information and communications technology investments that will provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. The GCSS-Army approved Capability Development Document and Capability Production Document require an enterprise approach to replace current logistics and maintenance Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS).  GCSS-Army provides the Army's sustainment support for the soldier with a seamless flow of timely, accurate, accessible, and secure information management that gives combat forces a decisive edge. The AESIP program provides the system's enterprise hub services, centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence/analytics.  GCSS-Army implements best business practices to streamline supply, accountability, maintenance, distribution, and reporting procedures in support of the future force transition path of The Army Campaign Plan. GCSS-Army Increment 1 is now in the Capability Support phase, but requires continuous enhancements and will have a large increase in FY 2021 for particular enhancements for ground disconnected operations (wartime requirement) and enhanced audit initiatives.. 

Building on the foundation of the GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) and Army Pre-Positioned Stock (APS) functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers.  Upon the completion of Increment 2, the Unit Level Logistics System-Aviation (Enhanced) (ULLS-A(E)), Unmanned Aircraft System-Initiative (UAS-I), and Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS) will be eligible for retirement since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by capabilties implemented in GCSS-ARMY, AESIP, and the Logistics Modernization Program.

The FY 2020 funding provides for the blueprinting, design, engineering, integration, and testing of the GCSS-Army Enterprise Aviation software enhancement Release 2. It continues work on the change requests for the baseline system, build out the BI/BW capability, enhance Army logistics common operating picture capability, and continue development of the APS capability in both GCSS-Army and the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GCSS-Army is the tactical unit/installation logistics system for the US Army and is essential for combat readiness. GCSS-Army modernizes automated logistics by implementing best business practices to streamline supply operations, maintenance operations, property accountability, tactical logistics and financial management and integration procedures in support of the Future Force transition path of the Army Campaign Plan.  GCSS-Army is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that tracks unit supplies, spare parts, organizational equipment, maintenance, total cost of ownership, and other financial transactions related to logistics for all Army units.  This modernized application subsumes the outdated STAMIS that is not financially compliant and will integrate numerous local supply and logistics databases into a single, enterprise-wide authoritative system.  GCSS-Army is financially compliant and is a key component for the Army Enterprise Strategy to be financially auditable.  GCSS-Army affects every supply room, motor pool, direct support repair shop, warehouse, Logistics Readiness Center, and property book office in the Army. GCSS-Army is a key component of an ERP integrated solution that optimizes tactical logistics and finance domain business processes into a single approach.  Delivering GCSS-Army eliminates the need for extensive maintenance and modification of aging, diverse software systems that are not cyber compliant, resulting in improved and efficient change control and configuration management through implementation of an enterprise system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Effective February 2, 2017, the DODI 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle for Defense Business Systems.  The DODI 5000.75 supersedes DODI 5000.02, improving the alignment of business systems to commercial best practices as well as optimizing efficiencies and effectiveness across the DOD for the acquisition of business systems.  Decisions rendered by the Milestone Decision Authority, as outlined in the DODI 5000.75, are referred to as "Authority To Proceed" and replace DODI 5000.02 "Milestones."

GCSS-Army has an evolutionary acquisition strategy, that defined, developed, and deployed an initial operational capability based upon proven technology, time-phased requirements, projected threat assessments, and demonstrated manufacturing capabilities.  Increment 1 is a viable stand alone capability.  GCSS-Army Increment I was implemented in two waves:

Wave 1 contains the retail supply and associated financial functions and completed fielding in November 2015.

Wave 2 contains the property book and maintenance and associated financial functions.  Fielding was completed in December 2017.

The GCSS-Army Increment I entered the Capability Support phase during FY 2018, and will enhance baseline capabilities using a continuous improvement approach.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The GCSS-Army program has two components: a functional component titled GCSS-Army and a technology enabler component provided by the AESIP Hub.  GCSS-Army, coupled with AESIP, are information and communications technology investments that currently provide key enabling support to the transformation of the Army into a network-centric, knowledge-based future force. 

Building on the foundation of GCSS-Army Increment 1, Increment 2 will provide the Army Enterprise Aviation maintenance, enhanced BI/BW and APS functional capabilities to deliver greater efficiencies and to improve information flow and accuracy in real time to decision makers.  Upon the completion of Increment 2, the ULLS-A(E), UAS-I, and AWRDS will be retired since the necessary functionality will have been replaced by capabilities implemented in GCSS-ARMY, AESIP Hub, and the Logistics Modernization Program.
Enterprise Aviation capabilities extends timely and accurate visibility and accountability of materiel across the Army Logistics enterprise to Aviation Logistics, will provide capability support to Army aviation airworthiness, and allow auditability of transactions to unit level.  Implementation of the BI/BW capabilities provide enhancements in materiel and supply chain readiness analytics that are critical to inform commanders' understanding of weapons systems readiness, helping them make better decisions faster on the battlefield and helping the Army achieve auditability.  The APS capabilities directly impacts the speed at which a deploying unit can draw combat equipment while reducing the burden of the day-to-day maintenance and accountability of APS stock in the LMP.  Increment 2 will have Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) requirements until FY 2022.

The FY 2020 funding for GCSS-Army Increment 2 provides RDT&amp;E efforts for Enterprise Aviation Release 2 to complete software development, Limited User Testing, Developmental Test and Evaluation, and begin Operational Test and Evaluation in FY 2020.  Release 3 will begin software development to include system design effort, design reviews and provide Development Test and Evaluation.  The BI/BW will be funded for incremental development to enhance AESIP Hub data foundation, enhance the Army Readiness Common Operating Picture and perform predictive analytics. 
The FY 2020 funding will also provide funds to continue Wave 3 APS design and development in GCSS-Army, AESIP and LMP, and to expand the streamlined LMP business processes associated with the planning and management of war reserve stock and integrate those processes across the ERPs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Army Joint and Strategic Command and Control (AJaSC2) is a modernization development effort for the Army's joint and strategic C2 capabilities. AJaSC2 provides the materiel solution in response to the Army Mission Command for Unified Action Capability Definition Package (AMCUA CDP). AJaSC2 enables Army operational headquarters to integrate with the Joint Force Commands and Unified Action Partners (UAP). AJaSC2 is a software only implementation of strategic applications and interoperability services that leverage the unified software architecture design (core infrastructure and selected common applications being implemented in the CPCE) that provides Army leaders:  Joint Common Operating Picture (COP); Adaptive planning and execution capabilities for distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration services to develop, revise, and execute their warfighting plans supported by theaterwide analytics; strategic Situational Awareness (SA) to coalition operations and other mission partners and coordination and synchronization of Joint Execution Mission Management. Capability Packages enabled by AJaSC2 are providing Force Employment, Joint Force Synchronization, and Total Force Analysis.  The operational payoff providing the Joint Force Commander a linkage between Army Mission Command and Unified Action Partners, enabling Unified Action through integration with existing and future applications (including CPCE and MCE) and contributes to achieving Shared Understanding during Unified Land Operations (ULO) facilitating effective Mission Command.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In accordance with the Army Mission Command for Unified Action (AMCUA) CDP approved December of 2014. The AMCUA CDP provides an overarching structure for future Army Mission Command systems. The AMCUA initiative will meet the requirements to enable planning and share situational awareness within an interdependent enterprise services network comprised of Unified Action Partners (UAP) and sister service components to achieve integrated mission operations. The AMCUA CDP defines the Land Component-unique Mission Command (MC) capabilities that the Army will develop to enable unified action through integration with existing and future Joint and Service command and control applications. MC capability contributions will enable Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) Commanders to gain and maintain Situational Awareness (SA), make decisions, and exercise authority and direction via a flexible, distributive and seamless system.

The acquisition strategy for AJaSC2 consists of the development, testing and fielding of Capability Packages implemented over time and synchronized with Command Post Computing Environment infrastructure. AJaSC2 will utilize the "Information Technology (IT) Box" construct. As such, evolutionary development of the software will continue as defined Capability Packages to meet emerging requirements that fall within the bounds of the approved IT Box. AJaSC2 strategy will consist of agile application development which will utilize and leverage existing and emerging technologies from Programs of Record and Common Operating Environment (COE) infrastructure. The product development under this R-Form will be accomplished in part under a Project Manager, Mission Command engineering services contract approach which will consist of multiple prime contractors competitively bidding on development efforts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) was designed to consolidate legacy broadcasts into an interoperable set of broadcasts that can carry threat warning and situational data to both users and producers. The requirement for IBS is documented in the Integrated SIGINT Information Mission Needs Statement (MNS) validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memo (JROCM) 115-95 on 15 September 1995. The JTT program is an effort to provide common tactical terminals capable of receiving and transmitting into the IBS UHF broadcasts. The House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence (HPSCI) requested an IBS Implementation Plan, which was approved by the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) (ref (i)) on 24 October 1995. The JTT was included as part of the solution in the Implementation Plan.  The JTT program Operational Requirements Document (ORD) was signed on 24 September 1996.  Subsequent updates in March 2005 and November 2017 were made to reflect changes in interoperability/Net Readiness certifications and Post Milestone C enhancements respectively.  Additional fact of life administrative changes were made and the updated ORD was signed on 25 April 2018.  The JTT is integrated into platforms that have a requirement to interact (transmit and/or receive) with the IBS Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB).  JTT is a post-Milestone C program. The legacy IBS Terminals will reach sustainment end-of-life in FY2025.  The procurement of a post-Milestone C replacement was initiated to replace the end-of-life systems, leverage updated technology, and enable flexible configurations to meet Joint customer operational needs. The procurement for a modernized Non-Developmental Item terminal will access multiple vendors by leveraging competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Project 11A:   The Advanced Payloads Development project line is a shared funding line between multiple Payload programs.  These Payload programs support the Army's transformation by developing Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) payload systems for Brigade Combat Teams, Divisions, and Corps Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  This is in accordance with Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) UAS priorities. Additionally, this Program Element (PE) supports Future Advanced Payloads for Army UAS systems. 

Small Tactical Radar - Lightweight (STARLite) Synthetic Aperture Radar/Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI)is a lightweight, high performance, all weather, multi-functional radar system for the Gray Eagle UAS. The STARLite system provides wide area, near real time Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) capabilities. It operates throughout the UAS flight mission profile in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode generates quality images for the battlefield commander for detection, classification and location of stationary commercial wheeled vehicle-size targets. The MTI mode detects moving ground targets, to include man-sized detection, and provides location information and performs cross-cue with the Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  STARLite is increasing its software capabilities based on Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results which will increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) to align with the Common Operating Environment (COE) requirement to enable Sensor Processing and Exploitation (SPE).  The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness.  

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) - Electro Optical / Infrared / Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD) provides High Definition (HD) Full Motion Video (FMV) in both the Electro Optical and Mid Wave IR spectrums with day/night capability to collect and display continuous imagery and the ability to designate targets of interest for attack by laser guided precision weapons.  It is the EO/IR/LD sensor for the Gray Eagle UAS which supports force applications, battlespace awareness, force protection, and net-centric operations across the battlefield to provide wide area, near real time RSTA capabilities. Current product improvements continue to focus on the development and implementation of technologies that directly support emerging requirements of the Army's Current and Future Force.     

Project 11B:   The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigurable to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs).  The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.  

Project 123:   The UAS Joint Technology Center/Systems Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts.  The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support. The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training and exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.  This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>MQ-1 PAYLOAD - UAS - A00020 is a shared Aircraft Procurement, Army (APA)  funding line for STARLite (A01003), Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) (A01004), and Common Sensor Payload (CSP) (A01005).</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>STARLite SAR/MTI is a threshold requirement for the Gray Eagle UAS.  The acquisition strategy for STARLite program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. Full Rate Production (FRP) was successfully achieved in June 2013. A follow-on production contract was awarded in April 2014 to procure all remaining STARLite Payloads required for the Gray Eagle platform.  Based on Initial Operational test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) results, STARLite is increasing its software capabilities to increase automation and upgrade to a common Graphical User Interface (GUI) and aligns SPE with the COE requirements. The SPE software enhancements will improve performance, reduce operator workload and enhance operator effectiveness. A competitive Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) funded contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman in October 2013 to perform trade studies and begin the development of the software  improvements.  Integration onto the Gray Eagle will be done via a sole source cost-plus fixed fee contract with the UAS prime contractor, General Atomics ASI.

Common Sensor Payload (CSP) EO/IR/LD enables the Gray Eagle to meet KPP (Key Performance Parameter) requirements. The acquisition strategy for the CSP program was based on a full and open competition for the Army. A competitive contract was awarded in November 2007 to Raytheon for the build, integration, test and delivery of the CSP. Full Rate Production (FRP) was achieved in June 2013. A three (3) year system support contract was awarded in July 2015 for sustainment and upgrade of the CSP to include retrofitting standard definition sensors with high definition sensors and to perform RDT&amp;E activities. The Enhanced EO/IR Capability Production Document, approved 19 December 2016, defines additional KPP requirements for Full Motion Video (FMV) sensors. The first KPP increases detection, recognition, and identification requirements which can only be met with the High Definition (HD) variation of the CSP. Currently, units are being fielded HD CSPs, with additional HD CSPs in production and retrofit. The second KPP requirement is for the CSP to be a metric sensor providing rapid and enhanced Target Location Accuracy (TLA). A five (5) year follow-on production and system support contract is scheduled for award in June 2019 for integration, test, upgrade, and sustainment of these enhanced capabilities. The FY 2020 acquisition strategy for CSP includes: maturation of hardware and software product improvements, production of qualification assets and initiation of testing necessary to meet identified CSP-TLA requirements, and efforts to improve situational awareness, provide multiple fields of view, and enhance targeting capabilities as CSP-TAI transitions from an S&amp;T effort to development.

The acquisition strategy is to complete STARLite SPE software developmental test and integration onto Gray Eagle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Tactical Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Payload (TSP) is a SIGINT sensor for the Gray Eagle that detects radio frequency (RF) emitters. The TSP system will provide a SIGINT capability to the tactical commander.  The TSP system will be a modular, scalable payload using an architecture that is software reconfigured to allow for growth and flexibility as technology, and as the adversaries use of technology, changes.  This flexible architecture allows for third party software applications to be integrated into the TSP system. The TSP system processing, control and data dissemination is integrated into the Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) via the Operational Ground Station. It supports Manned/Unmanned (MUM) teaming with Brigade Combat Team ground SIGINT Terminal Guidance (STG) teams and manned airborne assets.  The TSP system improves situational awareness and shortens the targeting cycle by detecting and identifying emitters associated with high value targets (HVTs). The TSP system is capable of processing conventional signals, standard military signals, and modern signals of interest.  This includes detection, recognition, identification, direction finding, and high confidence geo-location.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>TSP is a threshold requirement for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS. The TSP program completed the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase with a Milestone B decision in September 2011. The TSP Program EMD contract award was based on full-and-open competition with a period of performance that was completed in October 2015, and focused on integration and test onto the Gray Eagle platform, and integration and test of TSP software into the Operational Ground Station. The TSP EMD program is a derivative of systems that were fielded as a Quick Reaction Capability on the MQ-1C UAS and a variety of other manned platforms. The demonstrated scalability of these fielded materiel solutions allows the TSP EMD program to leverage effort that directly supports the TSP EMD program. 

The TSP program entered the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase with a Milestone C decision that was approved on 2 May 2014. The TSP Program LRIP contract award was based on sole source selection with a period of performance that was completed on June 2016, and primarily focused on the obsolescence of the EMD phase assets via the required Engineering Change Proposals, and the first initial production of 30 TSP Payloads in support of the Gray Eagle Platform. The TSP Program ICLS contract award was a result of  previous sole selection with a period of performance of 12-months with a 5 year option for total completion into August 2021. The primary focus supports fielding of system, continuous contractual support through operational and sustainment transition, engineering corrective actions, support of the MQ-1C (ER), and the conversion of the 30 LRIP TSP systems. 

The TSP Block 1 is the current Program of Record capability. TSP Beyond Block 1 will address objectives and remaining deferred Block 1 threshold requirements as reflected in the approved Capability Production Document (CPD). 

Improved Gray Eagle (IGE)- Program Manager Unmanned Aircraft Systems(PM UAS)received a Congressional plus up of $49M President's Budget 2015 to procure Extended Range UAS which increases the CPD objective endurance requirements for the current GE configuration to an Improved Gray Eagle (IGE).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Joint Technology Center/System Integration Laboratory (JTC/SIL) is a Joint facility that develops, integrates, and supports the enhancement of its Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE) capability for Army systems and operational concepts. The JTC/SIL conducts prototype hardware and software development, builds the UAS Institutional Mission Simulator (IMS) trainers for the Shadow, Hunter, and Gray Eagle programs, and provides modeling and simulation support.  The MUSE is a real-time, operator in-the-loop simulation that may be integrated with larger simulations in support of Army and Joint training exercises.  The MUSE is also employed as a Mission Rehearsal Tool for ongoing combat operations.  This project funds the management of the JTC/SIL and MUSE enhancements.

This system supports the Legacy to Objective transition path of the Transformation Campaign Plan (TCP).

Continued integration of Night Vision Image Generator (NVIG) into the Modeling &amp; Simulation domain as it pertains to UAS simulation.  Terrain, and model development for NVIG and Virtual Reality Scene Generator (VRSG) to increase fidelity.  Support of theater level Exercises, Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG), Yama Sakura (YS) and Key Resolve (KR).  Improvement of mapping capability for mission planning.  Redesign of Windows Entity Server (WES) and NetLink to improve network routing, thus lessening bandwidth consumption.  Incorporation of Common Image Generator Interface to provide an Image Generator (IG) agnostic solution thereby allowing for other IGs to be supported that are currently not supported.  Continued implementation of tactical protocols into the simulation domain to enhance interoperability.  Development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater.  Redesign of generic 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) application that will allow for creation of new platforms without touching code; again a reduction in costs and increased solution delivery speed.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Will continue development of a Heads Up Display (HUD) designer application that will allow for the creation and modification of HUDs without having to touch the software baseline thereby reducing costs and increasing fidelity and speed of solution in theater. Will continue implementation of generic 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) application that will allow for creation of new platforms without modifying code; again a reduction in costs and increased solution delivery velocity.  Will continue architecture optimization, to facilitate extensibility and scalability, to maintain readiness for growth of M&amp;S requirements coming from the Services.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.  

Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 in accordance with the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine (9). The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight (8). Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.

The RC-12X Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is a fixed-wing, airborne Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) collection and precision targeting location system. GRCS provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify/identify high value targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Aerial Exploitation Battalions providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. The Army's Acquisition Objective/Army's Procurement Objective is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd Ml; and seven (7) fielded to the 204th Ml, and five (5) trainers within TRADOC and INSCOM. Budget Item Justification is addressed in each Project.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army INSCOM Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT). 

This funding line supports non-recurring engineering (NRE), development of  type certificates (TC), testing, integration of Modifications in Service of Army Aerial, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) systems and engineering analysis/structural modifications to substantially increase EMARSS (King Air B300) payload capacity and time on station.  Funding provides for the integration of Department of Defense (DoD) mandated safety equipment to meet current and evolving International Standards. It also enhances aircraft communications, navigations and surveillance (CNS); aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) and the integration of the AISR mission equipment package (MEP) as well as obsolescence issues and commonality with EMARSS Program of Record (POR) aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The EMARSS RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH2 EMARSS ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH3 EMARSS Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02112 and AZ2054. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's newest generation C-12 based, direct support, manned airborne intelligence collection, processing, and targeting support system. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate, classify/identify, and track surface targets with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.  EMARSS is assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to combatant commanders. EMARSS is also assigned to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in support of training at the US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE). The Army Acquisition Objective for EMARSS is 36 systems, with an Army Procurement Objective of 24, to include the following variants: eight (8) EMARSS-G (Geo-INT); four (4) EMARSS-V (Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, VaDER); eight (8) EMARSS-M (Multi-INT); and four (4) EMARSS-S (SIGINT).

This funding line supports enhancements to the following sensor capabilities in order to maintain relevancy to the Warfighter: Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full Motion Video (FMV); Communications Intelligence (COMINT); Signals Intelligence (SIGINT); Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS); Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and improved Synthetic Aperture Radar / Moving Target Indicator (SAR/MTI) Radar; Line-Of-Site (LOS) and Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications; and Processing Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) supporting two Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) enabled operator workstations. 

Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 funding in the amount of $5.959 million continues the development of sensor enhancements and provides PED sensor engineering support.  The EMARSS sensor enhancements will replace the existing SIGINT and LiDAR capabilities with an improved sensor system which provides greater standoff range and significantly improved area coverage rate for the EMARSS platform.  This enhancement addresses the approved EMARSS Capability Production Document (CPD) performance requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Airborne Reconnaissance Low - Enhanced (ARL-E) is a worldwide self-deployable airborne Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) system designed for timely, accurate, assured support to tactical forces over the full spectrum of operations. This system is a De Havilland DHC-8 aircraft replacing the DHC-7 IAW the Aerial ISR (AISR) 2020 Strategy. ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR)/Full-Motion Video (FMV) , Multi-Mode Radar, Robust Communications Intelligence (COMINT), on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Enabled workstations. ARL-E will be assigned to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial ISR Brigade providing AISR support to combatant commanders. For the overall system, the Army Acquisition Objective and the Army Procurement Objective, is nine. The Mission Equipment Package (MEP) objective is eight.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 OCO funding of $14.000 million continues the new signal enhancement development effort to develop software to enhance the COMINT collection capabilities and the lab and flight test for Signal 3 and 4 software to see if it meets the requirements in the ARL-E CPD. This funding line supports continued software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Airborne Reconnaissance Low- Enhanced (ARL-E) RDTE efforts are found in the following two (2) project lines; 0305206AEH4 ARL ADV DEV (MIP) (Fixed Wing Project Office) and 0305206AEH5 ARL Payloads ADV DEV (Project Manager Sensors - Aerial Intelligence). The supporting procurement lines are A02110 and AZ2050. Separate funding lines support the Army Acquisition Executive's directive, codified in the October 28, 2011 memorandum, to assign overall acquisition lead for manned airborne Intelligence systems to Program Executive Officer for Aviation; and overall sensor, processing, exploitation, and dissemination responsibilities to Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>ARL-E will enhance the ARL-M sensor capability sets through the procurement of new and refurbished sensors to meet the ARL-E CPD requirements. It provides a persistent capability to include: Broad-Area Surveillance and/or Focused Stare on Target Areas of Interest (Point or Objective Targets), EO/IR FMV, COMINT, on-Board Collection, Analysis, Sensor Cross Cue and dissemination through DCGS-A Enabled workstations.  This includes software development to enhance COMINT collection capabilities. The software will be added to existing COMINT systems to effectively prosecute high priority and emerging modern signal emitters.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Guardrail Common Sensor (GRCS) is an airborne Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Collection and Location System capable of providing Tactical Commanders Near-Real Time intelligence. It provides a persistent capability to detect, locate and classify/identify critical targets with a relevant degree of timeliness and accuracy. GRCS is assigned to two (2) U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's Aerial Exploitation Battalions, providing Aerial Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) support to combatant commanders. In accordance with the Army's AISR 2020 strategy, the Army's Acquisition Objective/Army's Procurement Objective (AAO/APO) is 19 RC-12X; seven (7) fielded to 3rd MI BN; seven (7) fielded to the 204th MI BN, and five (5) pilot trainers to support Force Generation. The five (5) trainers are not equipped with Primary Mission Equipment (PME).

GRCS FY 2020 RDT&amp;E dollars in the amount of $2.000 million supports GRCS advanced signal enhancement efforts, development and testing of the signal enhancement infrastructure for GRCS updated SIGINT sensor capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Distributed Common Ground Systems - Army (DCGS-A) was formerly designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Common Ground System - Army (DCGS-A) is the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) System of Systems (SoS) for Joint, Interagency, Allied, Coalition, and National data analysis, sharing and collaboration.  The core functions of DCGS-A are:  the vertical and horizontal synchronization of ISR Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) efforts; operations in a networked environment at multiple security levels; the control of select Army and joint sensor systems; the fusion of all acquired data and information, and distribution of relevant red (threat), gray (non-aligned), and environmental (weather and terrain) information; and providing the Warfighters' early warning, targeting, and sensor ground station capabilities.  DCGS-A provides a single integrated ISR ground processing system composed of common components that are interoperable with sensors, other information sources, all Warfighting Functions, compliant with standards providing the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E) and Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  DCGS-A is fielded in Fixed, Mobile, and embedded configurations emphasizing the use of reach and split based operations by improving accessibility of data in order to reduce forward deployed footprint.  As enhanced commercial capabilities are integrated and tested, a continuing series of software capability drop releases will be provided into Army Common/commodity hardware and fielded to units IAW the Army Resourcing Priority List (ARPL) process.

DCGS-A is designated as a Program of Record (PoR) within the Command Post Computing Environment (CP CE) of the Common Operating Environment (COE).  DCGS-A provides the Single and Shareable Geospatial Foundation (SSGF) Cross Cutting Capability (CCC), and is defining the DCGS-A architecture to fit within the COE as described by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) COE Implementation Plan.   This is in accordance with the G-3/5/7 priority to align all Army networks, procurements and enhancements under one COE and one vision leveraging intelligence community investments. PM DCGS-A continues to work with PM Mission Command (PM MC) to converge on CP CE Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI).  

DCGS-A provides technologically advanced Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) capabilities through iterative software releases delivered in tailored and scalable mobile, fixed, and embedded configurations in all maneuver and maneuver support units from Company Intelligence Support Team to Army Service Component Command, and in select maneuver sustainment units battalion and above.  

FY 2020 Base funding in the amount of $38.121 million for D07, DCGS-A, will be used for modification, testing and integration of commercially available technologies to support multi-source intelligence processing at the tactical levels, as directed in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 113 and Section 220 that will increase the Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination capability our Army requires. DCGS-A will continue critical updates to the Army's ISR PED and multi-intelligence planning, analysis, and production capabilities through the exploitation of Cloud Computing and advanced analytics capabilities. This approach will achieve Information Technology efficiencies through alignment with the Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment (IC ITE), while providing iterative software updates required to remain current.  DCGS-A will focus on Capability Drop (CD) CD 2.  CD 2 will replace DCGS-A data management capabilities hosted at Echelons Above Corps, and adds advanced analytics and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning capabilities.  CDs 3-7 will provide enhanced Army Intelligence capabilities to the majority of Army Intelligence formations.  CD 3 will provide a modernized Data Management Architecture, leveraging open standards based on the DI2E that will allow additional capabilities (CDs 4-7) to be added in a plug and play fashion.  CD 3 will deliver improved interoperability aligned with the Army's Common Operating Environment (COE) and the concepts of converged Operations and Intelligence associated with the Command Post Computing Environment.  CD-3 will also provide automated "Level 2 Fusion" capabilities and a consistent user visualization framework.   CD 4 will provide targeting and collection management tools, Natural Language Processing, Text Analytics, and Open Source Analytics capabilities.  CD 5 will provide improved Counter Intelligence and Human Intelligence Reporting capabilities.  CD 6 will focus on Signals Intelligence analysis and Intelligence Support to Cyber Operations. CD 7 will support Geospatial capabilities for the Army's combat engineers and the Imagery Analyst.  As with CD's 1 and 2, CDs 3-7 will complete Market Research with the goal of identifying the best and most innovative commercial/NDI solutions, as directed by FY 2017 and FY 2018 NDAA language.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>The Distributed Common Ground System - Army is designated a Major Automation Information System (MAIS) program.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-A is a former ACAT IAM, Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program. The DCGS-A program will consist of multiple capability drops structured to meet DCGS-A User requirements.  The DCGS-A program will follow the Information Technology (IT) Box concept for an agile acquisition strategy to iteratively provide and field Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, hosted on Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment/hardware, providing low risk, efficient, time- phased releases of capability to satisfy the Army's operational needs.

The DCGS-A capabilities under Increment 1 will be leveraged to the maximum extent where applicable to meet the future DCGS-A requirements set. The DCGS-A will also leverage the Increment 1 configuration platforms fielded across the Army.

DCGS-A is a collection of software packages (COTS, and GOTS products) selected to provide each Army echelon (from Battalion up to Echelon Above Corps (EAC)) the capability to synthesize and exploit intelligence data. DCGS-A delivers these software packages on COTS and GOTS hardware components, tailored to meet each Army Echelon's intelligence mission requirements. DCGS-A is the Army's ISR Foundation Layer for Tasking, Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (TPED) and development of situation understanding using intelligence information about the threat, weather, and terrain at all Army Echelons.  DCGS-A provides the capabilities necessary for Commanders to access information, task organic sensors, and synchronize non-organic sensor assets with their organic assets. DCGS-A will continuously acquire and synthesize data and information from Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multi-national (JIIM) sources to maintain an updated and accurate understanding of the operational environment to inform critical and time sensitive command decisions.

The DCGS-A software baseline will be updated and iteratively deployed to address emerging and prioritized operational requirements. PM DCGS-A, in coordination with the operational user community, will  align releases with the technological readiness of targeted enhancements, and to support low-risk integration and test cycle times. As Capability Drop 3-7 requirements are approved, DCGS-A will leverage commercially-available solutions and non-developmental items (NDI) to meet user needs, based on market research results.   DCGS-A will issue commercial contracts or conduct NDI technology transitions from DoD Science and Technology organizations, or will re-use NDI from other Army programs, Services, or other Governmental Agencies. The DCGS-A software will be hardware agnostic so that the software can be deployed in any processing hardware equipment. This allows the DCGS-A software to be scalable and deployable in different hardware system configurations, as required by the Army at different echelons. The implementation of the latest COTS hardware procurement through the Army Common Hardware System (CHS) program with the established post-deployment hardware sparing, sustainment, and maintenance provisions, will result in significant cost efficiencies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>An Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) Operational Requirement Document (ORD) was approved by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) 6 Apr 2005.  Milestone B occurred on 20 Apr 2005, and the System Development and Demonstration contract was awarded 8 Aug 2005, as a result of a competitive solicitation which included a vendor system capabilities demonstration.  A Capabilities Production Document (CPD), version 8.7 was approved on 17 Jul 15.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle completed FOTE 12 Jun 2015.  On 14 Jul 2015, the trigger Configuration Steering Board (CSB) concurred with the Course of Action (COA) to validate the revised requirement for the Echelons Above Division (EAD) Gray Eagle and grant authorities through a new Acquisition Decision memorandum (ADM) to pursue the extended range capable Gray Eagle configuration.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range is an enhanced derivative of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle UAS and closes the capability gap by delivering extended surveillance coverage which supports Army RSTA missions in excess of 34 hours.  MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range's increased performance provides the capacity for multi-intelligence payloads, precision strike capability, and reconnaissance in support of Special Operations Forces (SOF), Mission Command from Aerial Intelligence Brigade (AIB) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).  The Gray Eagle Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) acquisition strategy emphasis will be to complete Developmental test events (Environmental, E3, Transportability, software and Air Vehicle Performance Tests) to define and address system risks, followed by an FOTE II for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnaissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

A FoSUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS) which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) and Long Range Reconnaissance and Surveillance (LRRS) options under development.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $3.218 million for Program Management Engineering support and to meet Capabilities Production Document (CPD) Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRR prototype solution and the LRRS prototype solution for the FoSUAS effort.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (FoSUAS) provides battalion and below ground maneuver elements with critical situational awareness and enhanced force protection.  The system provides the small unit commander an organic and responsive reconnissance and targeting capability with real-time Full Motion Video and sensor data.  Other compatible receivers, such as the One System Remote Video Terminal and appropriately equipped manned platforms may also receive the FoSUAS products.

A FoSUAS includes three hand-launched aircraft that do not require an improved launch/recovery location.  In addition to the aircraft, the system contains ground control equipment, which includes an interoperable handheld ground control station (H-GCS), which incorporates the Tactical Open Government Owned Architecture (TOGA).  The equipment is fully transportable in or on rucksack type packs that are organic to the unit.  FoSUAS will utilize existing RQ-11 in a system of systems fielding concept, with Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) and Long Range Reconnaissance and Surveillance (LRRS) options under development.

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) Base funding of $3.218 million for Program Management Engineering support and to meet CPD Increment II Block II related requirements.  Specifically, to continue the research and development required to identify and baseline the SRR prototype solution and the LRRS prototype solution for the FoSUAS effort.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The RQ-7Bv2 Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS) provides the Army Brigade Commander with dedicated Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA), Intelligence, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and Force Protection. In line with the Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) three Shadow Platoons are being integrated into the 11 Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) Apache Reconnaissance Battalions. This will provide Aviation Brigades with Manned-Unmanned-Teaming (MUM-T) and enhanced Aerial Scout capabilities. The RQ-7B Shadow has logged approximately 1,180,000 flight hours, most of which were flown in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

The full Shadow system consists of four air vehicles with payload, two Universal Ground Control stations, two Universal Ground Data Terminals, one Portable Ground Control Station with Portable Ground Data Terminal, Ground Support Equipment, two launchers, ten High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) with trailer(s), and a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle. Each system is equipped with one Maintenance Section Multifunctional (MSM) and is supported at the division level by a Mobile Maintenance Facility (MMF). The baseline fielded payload was the electro-optic infrared (EO/IR), but half of those have been replaced with a Laser Designator (LD) payload. An Improved Payload for Shadow, selected by Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR), will be integrated and qualified in FY 2019-2020. 110 of 115 Shadow systems required by the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) have been resourced. 

Justification: Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 RQ-7Bv2 TUAS Base funding of $7.817 million will be utilized for the following: 1) $4.757M will be used for test and evaluation of the RQ-7Bv2 TUAS, 2) $3.060M provides interoperability and enhancements for the One System Remote Video Terminal (OSRVT).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>A System Capability Demonstration (SCD) was conducted with four contractors. The results from the SCD in conjunction with proposal evaluations resulted in the competitive down select of a Best Value TUAS. A successful Milestone II Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) was conducted 21 December 1999 and a Milestone III Decision was reached on 25 September 2002. The full rate production contract was awarded 27 December 2002 and in FY 2009 the last of the authorized 104 systems was placed on contract. Continued development of the selected Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (TUAV) system will be accomplished through a series of modifications and retrofits such as Shadow v2, Communications Relay, Laser Designator, Block III engine, and reliability upgrades. Development/integration of these improved capabilities will be through individual efforts on a competitive technical services contract with Shadow contractors. Development of the Block III engine was accomplished through a competitive process. Management responsibilities of the TUAV RQ-7B variant EO/IR/LD payload was transferred from Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to PEO Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (IEW&amp;S) on 14 February 2017. This was done in accordance with (IAW) ASA(ALT) memorandum titled: Transfer of Army Office of Primary Responsibility and Program Management Responsibility for RQ-7B Shadow EO/IR/LD. An Improved Payload for Shadow, competitively selected by PEO IEW&amp;S - Product Manager Electro-Optic/Infrared (PdM EO/IR), will be integrated and qualified in FY 2019-2020.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Next Generation Biometrics Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement system for the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A).  The BAT-A is the current Army Program of Record for tactical biometrics collection capability.  The BAT-A was originally developed as a Quick Reaction Capability.  These devices have been deployed in a combat zone for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC will be an integrated system of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software, comprising a kit, data base, and transport architecture.  NXGBCC will be capable of operating on multiple communications networks and achieve near real-time identity matching and data synchronization.  NXGBCC will add to the number of biometric modalities collected, provide matches to the Warfighter in less than 3 minutes, increase the data sharing capability, and reduce weight, power, and cost.  NXGBCC will use a Local Trusted Source composed of a distributed database capable of being used worldwide, data management software, forward biometric matching software, and an analysis portal.  Also, the NXGBCC collection kit(s) will be composed of 1 or more collection devices, a credential/badge device, and document scanning device.  Beginning with FY 2020, funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 has been moved to project FL5.
  
Identity Intelligence Repository (I2AR) will serve as an analytical tool to produce, manage, and disseminate the DoD Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) as well as extend opportunities for system and data integration with enhanced analytic data sharing across the Army and Intelligence Community (IC) partners.  Analysts will use I2AR to conduct analysis and develop intelligence reports, in support of DoD and national community missions.  I2AR will include the legacy Biometric Identity Intelligence Resource (BI2R) functionality as well as elasticity, encryption, and open source software for enduring interoperability with DoD, IC, and external partners.

Justification:
Beginning with FY 2020, funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 has been moved to project FL5. The $2.000 million of FY 2020 Base Funding in FL5 will complete the prototype selection process via the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) started in FY 2018.  Also, the program office will begin Operational and Interoperability Testing along with New Equipment Training development.

The FY 2020 OCO of $2.214 million in BI7 will continue to support the development of new software code &amp; associated testing to deliver the Identity Intelligence Analytic Resource (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by DoD's intelligence analysts to create products such as the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and other worldwide missions) on cloud computing platforms.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Next Generation Biometrics Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement system for the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A).  The BAT-A is the current Army Program of Record for tactical biometrics collection capability.  The BAT-A was originally developed as a Quick Reaction Capability.  These devices have been deployed in a combat zone for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC will be an integrated system of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software, comprising a kit, data base, and transport architecture.  NXGBCC will be capable of operating on multiple communications networks and achieve near real-time identity matching and data synchronization.  NXGBCC will add to the number of biometric modalities collected, provide matches to the Warfighter in less than 3 minutes, increase the data sharing capability, and reduce weight, power, and cost.  NXGBCC will use a Local Trusted Source composed of a distributed database capable of being used worldwide, data management software, forward biometric matching software, and an analysis portal.  Also, the NXGBCC collection kit(s) will be composed of 1 or more collection devices, a credential/badge device, and document scanning device.  Beginning with FY 2020, funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 has been moved to project FL5.

Identity Intelligence Repository (I2AR) will serve as an analytical tool to produce, manage, and disseminate the DoD Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL) as well as extend opportunities for system and data integration with enhanced analytic data sharing across the Army and Intelligence Community (IC) partners.  Analysts will use I2AR to conduct analysis and develop intelligence reports, in support of DoD and national community missions.  I2AR will include the legacy Biometric Identity Intelligence Resource (BI2R) functionality as well as elasticity, encryption, and open source software for enduring interoperability with DoD, IC, and external partners.

Justification:
The FY 2020 OCO of $2.214 million in BI7 will continue to support the development of new software code &amp; associated testing to deliver the Identity Intelligence Analytic Resource (I2AR) a replacement for the Biometrics Identity Intelligence Repository (BI2R -the unique software-based analytic production system used by DoD's intelligence analysts to create products such as the Biometric Enabled Watchlist for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) and other worldwide missions) on cloud computing platforms.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The acquisition strategy will be to exercise a contract option which enables for continuation of a contractor to develop activities for the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) approved Quick Reaction Capability (QRC).

The NXGBCC acquisition strategy is to procure a limited development integrated solution that meets the NXGBCC collect/store/match/share requirements and interfaces with the Biometric Family of Systems.  The strategy will maximize mature technologies (integrated commercial off the shelf products) and reward industry for providing a solution that can be fielded in FY 2021.  The program office will use an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to down-select prototypes from commercial vendors.  Upon OTA completion, the Initial Operating Test, procurement, fielding and sustainment of NXGBCC will begin.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Next Generation Biometrics Collection Capability (NXGBCC) is the replacement system for the Biometrics Automated Toolset-Army (BAT-A).  The BAT-A is the current Army Program of Record for tactical biometrics collection capability.  The BAT-A was originally developed as a Quick Reaction Capability.  These devices have been deployed in a combat zone for over 19 years, well beyond the standard 3 to 6 years of useful electronic equipment life.  NXGBCC will be an integrated system of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and software, comprising a kit, data base, and transport architecture.  NXGBCC will be capable of operating on multiple communications networks and achieve near real-time identity matching and data synchronization.  NXGBCC will add to the number of biometric modalities collected, provide matches to the Warfighter in less than 3 minutes, increase the data sharing capability, and reduce weight, power, and cost.  NXGBCC will use a Local Trusted Source composed of a distributed database capable of being used worldwide, data management software, forward biometric matching software, and an analysis portal.  Also, the NXGBCC collection kit(s) will be composed of 1 or more collection devices, a credential/badge device, and document scanning device.  

Justification:
Beginning with FY2020, funding for NXGBCC previously reflected in project BI7 has been moved to project FL5. The $2.000 million of FY20 Base Funding will complete the prototype selection process via the Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) started in FY18.  Also, the program office will begin Operational and Interoperability Testing along with New Equipment Training development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1:  Unified Network. 

FE1: Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS)/Digital Communications System (DCS) (Phase II):
This project develops Satellite Communication (SATCOM) ground subsystem equipment and software in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) validated Mission Command Network and Systems (MCNS) requirements for the worldwide Defense Enterprise Wideband SATCOM System (DEWSS). DEWSS is composed of the Super High Frequency (SHF) Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) programs, which are required to support legacy, interim and emerging communication space architectures and future Force requirements. Expansion of the WGS constellation and upgrades to both DSCS and WGS are vital to support the Army's emerging power projection and rapid deployment role. DSCS and WGS provide multiple channels of tactical end-to-end connectivity and interoperability with strategic networks and national decision-makers, satisfying JCS network operations.

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM)System Engineering (SE):
Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces. These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

FE4 / Enroute Mission Command:  
Mission Description and Budget Item Justification:
Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective. The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.

Due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019, program was restructured in Dec 2015. MDA addressed schedule issues (Oct 2016) by authorizing to field a Ku FISA FOC (4QFY17) and complete a Modification Word Order (MWO), adding Ka FISA capability, post Ku FISA FOC.

FI8:  Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM (Protected SATCOM) provides for a critical protected communications gap in anti-jam SATCOM capability across the Army with the denigration of the current protected terminal. It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams; and development, testing and certification of prototype Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminals which will augment existing AEHF terminals. The PTW efforts are linked to the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and its follow-on satellite constellation.

In FY2020, a new start development of Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype. The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers post FY2025. This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements. It will provide AEHF protected SATCOM capability in a modular, more transportable, vehicle agnostic form factor, providing greater flexibility on the battlefield. The terminal will be built with the intent to migrate from the AEHF constellation to the PTS constellation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This finances Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) netcentric systems engineering, modem risk mitigation, and risk management framework support.  Funding provides for SATCOM terminal upgrades, enhancement of baseband throughput capabilities, technology insertion and upgrades which improves SATCOM gateway resiliency while allowing for full utilization of Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) capabilities.  Both the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and the Enterprise Wideband SATCOM Terminal System (EWSTS) Capability Production Documents (CPDs) contain Netcentric-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR-KPPs) as required by CJCSI 6212.01C.  Netcentric efforts are required to facilitate the migration from the current trunk-based communications systems to Internet Protocol (IP) based systems and to engineer, test and integrate IP based capabilities into WSOMS and EWSTS systems.  Studies, risk mitigation, system integration and advanced demonstrations for Netcentric baseband and policy based control will accommodate technology insertion, data sharing, remote operations, architecture efforts and use of commercial technology, thus ensuring the life of the Defense Enterprise Wideband Satellite System (DEWSS) terminal family beyond 2025 and reducing lifecycle costs and enterprise requirements on the WGS and Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) satellites in the future.  Contracting approach for new technology is through the use of Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project FE2, MILSATCOM System Engineering supports the Army's Network Modernization Line of Effort (LOE) #1, Unified Network.

FE2: Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) System Engineering (SE) assures that tactical Army Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and SATCOM On-The-Move (SOTM) systems are engineered to legally and efficiently operate worldwide. MILSATCOM SE shapes Joint SATCOM systems' design efforts, standards development and planning processes. MILSATCOM SE represents the Army's tactical interests within DoD, Commercial &amp; International forums to ensure affordable and scalable future SATCOM capabilities for maneuver forces.  These efforts ensure that the Army continues to evaluate evolving technologies for the planning and designing of SATCOM solutions that reduce technical and programmatic impacts.

FY 2020 funds the systems engineering required to support technology maturation, systems analysis, and planning associated with joint SATCOM development efforts including complying with the outcome of the Protected SATCOM Communications Systems (PSCS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). This line continues to fund the systems architecture and analysis for current and future SATCOM efforts in both wideband and protected satellite communications.  This effort includes collaborative work with the Air Force on the prototype Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD) development and associated modem testing.

In addition, FY 2020 funding covers the Narrowband Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Network Centric Waveform Tool (NCWT) Development and Testing and other efforts that have impact on tactical Army use of military and commercial satellite constellations. These efforts have a direct impact in reducing technical and programmatic risk for the acquisition efforts for tactical Army SATCOM systems using these constellations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enroute Mission Command supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line Of Effort (LOE) 1 - Unified Network.

Enroute Mission Command (EMC) supports the Global Response Force (GRF) and other Army units with the requirement to conduct Airborne forced entry operations with the ability to conduct mission command, to include mission planning and rehearsal, while enroute on board US Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft. EMC provides a modernization to enroute communications to enable broadband reach-back data capability utilizing military or commercial networks with adequate bandwidth support required by Mission Command and Intelligence applications. EMC will provide commanders with the ability to obtain and share near real-time information regarding intelligence, situational awareness and command and control information while enroute to their objective.  The ability to adjust plans and strategize utilizing the latest Intel data will give the GRF the information dominance needed to execute their mission once they arrive at their objective.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructure in Dec 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability began in FY18.

FY 2019 funding supports the Post Deployment Assessment (PDA) requirement which will validate the EMC capability for warfighters to conduct mission command utilizing the Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), Dependent Airborne Node (DAN) and Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN) on the C17 aircraft.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The continued procurement of the EMC full operational capability follows DoDI 5000.02, 7 Jan 2015, Enclosure 13, Rapid Fielding of Capabilities. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) and project manager will tailor and streamline program strategy based on the required timelines to meet urgent need capability requirements. The Army Executive Agent signed an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) on 27 April 2015 delegating MDA to PEO C3T.  The MDA signed an ADM on 11 May 2015 selecting the KuKa Antenna and Radome for the Full Operational Capability (FOC). An ADM was signed on 20 May 2015 granting approval to enter into production and deployment phase.  

Ku FOC was achieved in September 2017 as directed by MDA due to rephasing of FY 2017 OPA funding into FY 2018/2019 and program was restructured in Dec 2015. A Modification Work Order (MWO), adding Ka Fixed Installed Satellite Antenna (FISA) capability began in FY18.

FY 2019 funding (173142 FE4) supports the Post Deployment Assessment (PDA) requirement which will validate the EMC capability for warfighters to conduct mission command utilizing the Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), Dependent Airborne Node (DAN) and Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN) on the C17 aircraft.  

Initial Operational Capability met in May 2015 with modification of five C-17s with satellite antennae and installation kits, and roll-on/roll-off, battalion level, Key Leader Node (KEN).  FOC is 35 C-17s, eight Key Leader Enroute Node (KEN), and 24 company level Dependent Airborne Nodes (DAN), and a Command and Staff Palletized Airborne Node (CASPAN).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Protected Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM (1203142A/FI8) is a continuation of efforts previously funded by the Army under PE 1203142A- SATCOM Ground Environment (SPACE) - MILSATCOM Systems Engineering (FE2). The Protected SATCOM (1203142A/FI8) funding also includes a new start effort to test commercial Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype to meet recently identified critical capability gaps for anti-jam SATCOM.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project FI8, Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #1, Unified Network.

FI8: Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM (Protected SATCOM) provides for a critical protected communications gap in anti-jam SATCOM capability across the Army. It provides the ability for the tactical Army to be resilient in a contested environment and protect against potentially catastrophic loss of situational awareness and command and control during critical battle movement. It will offer the Tactical Army protection against interference that is either intentional or unintentional. The effort includes development of a critical Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modem which will be integrated into Army tactical SATCOM terminals to provide higher throughputs, protection (anti-jam) against Electronic Warfare (EW), and resiliency in a contested environment; development of a dual small form factor modem that can run the PTW and the current Network Centric Waveform (NCW) to Army Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESBs) and eventually Army Corps, Division, and Brigade Combat Teams; and development, testing and certification of prototype Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminals which will augment existing AEHF terminals. The PTW efforts are linked to the Air Force and DoD's plans for PTW on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) and its follow-on satellite constellation. 

FY2020 funds will continue collaborative development, testing and certification with the US Air Force and Navy of a PTW modem and a Protected Tactical Satellite (PTS). The prototype of a protected modem and protected satellite were previously funded under the FE2 MILSATCOM Systems Engineering during the Protected Tactical Service Field Demo (PTSFD). The PTW modem and the accompanying satellite constellation continue the spiral development of critical protected communications capabilities. The funding on FI8 Protected SATCOM incorporates the Army specific requirements to be included in these efforts. 

FY2020 funds will  start efforts to test commercial Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototypes to meet recently identified critical capability gaps for anti-jam SATCOM.  The new terminal will augment the existing capability of the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T) AEHF terminal, with the intent to backfill decreasing SMART-T numbers due to obsolescence. This ensures the Army's ability to meet increasing EW threat requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>This project funds advanced systems engineering, research, development, test and evaluation of emerging protected Satellite Communications technologies to provide resilience and anti-jam protection against Electronic Warfare (EW).  The program will leverage contracts established by the Air Force for the development of Protected Tactical Waveform (PTW) modems, including development of a dual small form factor modem capable of running the PTW and Network Centric Waveform - Resilient (NCW-R), beginning in FY2020.  Production and Fielding of the PTW modems will begin in FY2023 under the Protected Anti-JAM Tactical SATCOM procurement line (B34002).

This project also funds the research, development and testing of an Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected SATCOM terminal prototype to aid in filling the identified critical protected communications.  This terminal is a direct follow-on effort to the Secure, Mobile, Anti-Jam, Reliable, Tactical Terminal (SMART-T).  The Program Office is working closely with the US Air Force on scheduling insertion of the terminal into the satellite Mission Planner as well as working with NSA to develop a timely path to certification.  The terminal research and development effort will be awarded in FY2020; a developmental test combined with a robust Military utility user assessment will inform an FY2022 decision point on the path forward for the terminal.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. 

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2, Spiral 1 delivers increased sensor capabilities to include, but not limited to processing SBIRS GEO satellite Staring sensor data and additional Highly Elliptical Orbit data. Spiral 2 delivers increased sensor access, communication upgrades, and enhanced training/exercise capabilities (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing in accordance with the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2018-21).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible. Operational Need Statement (ONS) 18-22681 resulted in an Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) approval (13 Apr 18) for the fielding of JTAGS Block II systems, replacing the legacy JTAGS Block I systems. Fielding of the JTAGS Block II Phase 1 systems began in 2018 and is ongoing. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) are developing Capabilities Production Documents (CPDs) to address emerging threats that are already known and future requirements. JTAGS must stay concurrent with any future overhead persistent infrared sensor capabilities to remain relevant and retain resiliency of Teater Event System (TES). 

FY 2020 requested funding of $10.275 million will allow for the continued Spiral 3 software tuning efforts to fully exploit sensor data, evolving cyber hardening advances, emerging threats, and initial planning for 2021 Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) is a post-production, ACAT Ill program and is designated as a DoD Space Program. JTAGS provides missile warning message data for the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and improves performance for Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control Systems/Composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades. 

JTAGS disseminates near real time warning, alerting, and cueing information on ballistic missile launches and other tactical events of interest throughout the theater using existing communication networks, providing critical support to Combatant Commanders in their Areas of Responsibility (AOR).  Four OCONUS deployed JTAGS units, which are deployed in three theaters (PACOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM), constitute DoD's only in-theater system providing space-based missile warning. The fifth CONUS system is used as an institutional trainer though is available as a deployable asset.  JTAGS is designated as the in-theater element of the United States Strategic Command's Theater Event System (TES), supporting all Theater Missile Defense pillars, affording the shortest sensor to shooter connectivity. 

The JTAGS Program Element (PE) supports development and test to meet JTAGS Operational Requirement(s) Document (ORD) thresholds using improved sensors and algorithms as Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I).  P3I Improvements upgrade JTAGS to a new Block II configuration for operation with the next generation of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites, and improves warning tactical parameters and timeliness. JTAGS Block II is on contract for a two-Phase development effort. JTAGS Block II Phase 1 is complete. JTAGS Block II Phase 2 activities are broken into three spirals to expedite delivering critical capabilities sooner. Phase 2, Spiral 1 delivers increased sensor capabilities to include, but not limited to processing SBIRS GEO satellite Staring sensor data and additional Highly Elliptical Orbit data. Spiral 2 delivers increased sensor access, communication upgrades, and enhanced training/exercise capabilities (FY2018-19). Spiral 3 delivers software tuning and testing in accordance with the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) (FY2018-21).  JROC-Memos 197-12 and 113-13 supports the need to develop and field JTAGS Block II capabilities as soon as possible. Operational Need Statement (ONS) 18-22681 resulted in an Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) approval (13 Apr 18) for the fielding of JTAGS Block II systems, replacing the legacy JTAGS Block I systems. Fielding of the JTAGS Block II Phase 1 systems began in 2018 and is ongoing. Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)/Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) are developing Capabilities Production Documents (CPDs) to address emerging threats that are already known and future requirements. JTAGS must stay concurrent with any future overhead persistent infrared sensor capabilities to remain relevant and retain resiliency of the Theater Event System (TES). 

FY 2020 requested funding of $10.275 million will allow for the continued Spiral 3 software tuning efforts to fully exploit sensor data, evolving cyber hardening advances, emerging threats,  and initial planning for 2021 Follow-On Test and Evaluation (FOTE).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

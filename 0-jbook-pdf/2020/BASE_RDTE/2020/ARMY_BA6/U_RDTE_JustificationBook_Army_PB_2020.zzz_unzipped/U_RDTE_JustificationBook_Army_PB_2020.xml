            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports the design, development, acquisition, integration and fielding of realistic mobile threat simulators and realistic threat simulation products utilized in Army/Department of Defense (DoD) training and developmental and operational tests. This PE originally funded simulators representing Soviet equipment, but scope was expanded to address emerging world threats. Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products are utilized to populate test battlefields for United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), to conduct developmental and operational tests, and to support Program Executive Office (PEO) required user testing in System Integration Laboratories (SILs) and hardware/simulation in-the-loop facilities. These battlefield simulators represent adversary systems (e.g. missile systems, command, control and communications systems, electronic warfare systems, etc.) in order to portray a realistic threat environment during testing of U.S. weapon systems.

Army Threat Simulator and Threat Simulation products developed or fielded under this PE support Army-wide, non-system-specific threat product requirements. Each capability is pursued in concert and coordination with existing Army/DoD and Tri-Service capabilities to eliminate duplication of effort. Simulator development is responsive to Office of the Secretary of Defense and Government Accountability Office guidance for the Army to conduct operational testing in a realistic threat environment. Actual threat equipment is acquired when appropriate (in lieu of development) and total package fielding is still required (i.e., instrumentation, operations and maintenance, manuals, new equipment training, etc.). Threat simulator development is accomplished under the auspices of the Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) Threat Simulator Investment Working Group.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>NETT is a comprehensive Threat Cyberspace Operations (TCO) tool designed for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) to portray evolving hostile and malicious Threat effects within the Cyber domain. Program will continue to provide an integrated suite of open-source/open-method exploitation tools to be integrated with robust reporting and instrumentation capabilities. NETT is used by TCO teams to replicate the tactics of state and non-state Threats and is supported by a robust TCO development environment. The Cyber domain is the most rapidly changing domain in which our systems operate. NETT program will continue research of these capabilities and will use an in-depth process to clean, fix, sustain, modernize, and integrate required Threat tools, tactics, and techniques that will be needed during T&amp;E. Focus areas include: continued Threat integration, instrumentation, distributed collaboration between multiple users, targets and attack visualization, data collection and remote agent development.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Aerial Targets Project supports Army readiness through development, acquisition, operation and modernization of aerial targets. Multi-spectral Aerial Targets include realistic surrogates, actual high performance threat aircraft, and virtual target computer models. Current and emerging weapons systems require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess weapons systems effectiveness in the operational environment. This program encompasses a portfolio of full-scale, miniature, and subscale fixed wing/rotary wing targets, virtual targets, ancillary devices, and associated control systems. For accurate threat portrayal that properly stresses weapons systems during test and evaluation, aerial targets must exhibit the flight characteristics, threat signatures, and other performance factors to represent or emulate relevant and validated threats. This Project funds: the long-range planning necessary to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirements; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation, production, and modernization; execution of the validation process to ensure that aerial targets accurately represent the threat; as well as storage and repair parts. The Army is the Test Enterprise Reliance lead for Rotary Wing Targets and Towed Target development and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing High Speed Aerial Target.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds Army efforts to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of advanced weapon systems and supports Army Modernization and Tri-Service readiness by developing ground target surrogates, acquiring foreign equipment, and developing virtual target computer models of ground vehicle targets. These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing T&amp;E. The U.S. Army is the Tri-Service lead for providing mobile ground targets for T&amp;E. This tasking includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the centralized management of the ground target research, development, test and evaluation processes; execution of the validation process; acquisition of foreign equipment; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development/enhancement/update via engineering services of developed and acquired targets to ensure availability for T&amp;E customers. This Project also manages use of current assets and operates a centralized spare parts program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds the development and acquisition of major developmental test instrumentation for the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) test activities: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Arizona; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Maryland; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Arizona; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Alabama; and for the Reagan Test Site (RTS) at the U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA), which is managed by the Space and Missile Defense Command. This PE also funds development and acquisition of Operational Test Command's (OTC) major field instrumentation and, until Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, management of the Cyber Acquisition Blue Teams (CABT) certification standards. Requirements for instrumentation and cyber certifications are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Army testing facilities are also surveyed to determine major testing capability shortfalls.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds improvement and modernization (I&amp;M) for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS) instrumentation systems. The Reagan Test Site with its remote location and one of kind instrumentation systems provides a strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. In order to continue its critical mission of testing missile systems that are of paramount importance to the defense of the nation, the RTS instrumentation systems must be continuously updated and upgraded to support the emerging technologies being developed by the DoD such as hypersonics and other advanced weapons systems. Without modernization these instrumentation systems face obsolescence or degraded capability and the inability to provide the critical data needed for continued materiel development. Without instrumentation on par with the technologies being utilized in emerging systems, the materiel developer will be unable to complete their test programs or pass programmatic milestones toward deployment. These funds provide modernization of the radar, telemetry, optics, range safety, communications, command/control and other equipment essential to meet test and evaluation requirements of the Services and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. The RTS instrumentation is required to support data collection for test &amp; evaluation assessments and operational decisions that have strategic implications for the Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other customers. RTS, located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Funding will enable RTS to continue to meet customer objectives and sustain the required instrumentation suite.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ROSA Refresh plan is to incorporate subsystem technologies into the Ground-Based Radar Prototype (GBR-P), then transition those technologies to the other RTS sensors. Much of the testing and integration lessons will be learned ahead of time, providing a drop-in updated solution for legacy ROSA components at the other radars identified as having long-term sustainability issues. In this approach, the ROSA refresh effort is coupled with the GBR-P modernization leading to a cleaner and more cost-effective program.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>This activity will develop the technology required to modernize the telemetry systems using an innovative software defined radio approach designed to vastly improve the ability to adapt to future telemetry changes and requirements quickly with lower cost. In addition, this approach will enable centralized command and control of the telemetry equipment increasing efficiency in mission preparation and execution. The telemetry back-end processing chain is currently comprised of discrete frequency- specific hardware components that are replicated for each telemetry channel required for a test event. This activity will develop a scalable frequency-agnostic, software-based solution that runs on commodity computer servers. More complex missions (e.g., Over-the-air (OTA) operational testing of the Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS)) will continue to require more telemetry channels, but this activity will avoid much of that future cost. This effort will provide enough hardware to increase capacity of the telemetry system.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project develops and acquires major test instrumentation to perform developmental testing of weapon systems at U. S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL.

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total Project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These Projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team. FY20 funds will be used for modernization of outdated instrumentation in support of developmental testing for Army, Department of Defense programs.

Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems. This Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items. Nuclear Effects Test Capabilities Modernization acquires and upgrades Special Test Equipment for nuclear facilities located at WSMR. These acquisitions and upgrades include the Pulse Current Injection Simulator, Prompt Gamma Simulator, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Semi-Conductor Test Lab, Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users. Test Network Modernization (TNM) will upgrade existing test data networks to ensure infrastructures are capable of providing reliable and secure transport of data and communications for ATEC test activities. Applied Environments Modernization (AEM) program will upgrade antiquated Environmental labs for climatic and dynamic testing with new cascade refrigeration units, climatic chambers, vibration test systems, x-ray cameras, a real-time radiography system and full spectrum solar lights. Future Wireless Network program (FWN) will procure and integrate wireless network technologies across ATEC test activities which will provide near real-time data collection support for Developmental Test and Operational Test events. Robotics/Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Instrumentation Suite will develop and procure instrumentation for testing controlled and autonomous ground and aerial robotic systems. System of Systems Cooperative Engagement Test Infrastructure (SCETI) will provide for the development of systems to conduct systems-level Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) testing for both aircraft and ground systems in a distributed environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the development, acquisition, and integration of major operational test instrumentation for the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's Operational Test Command and supporting test activities at test and training ranges. Requirements for instrumentation are identified through a long range survey of project managers, Research Development and Engineering Centers (RDECs), and Battle Laboratories developing future weapon systems and the test programs that support these systems. Project focus is to address Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E)-identified Army test realism shortfalls.

Projects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (greater than $1.5 million per year or $7.5 million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services. These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.

The DOT&amp;E annual report to Congress identified shortfalls in the Army's abilities to create realistic operational environments. The Integrated Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE) project will address multiple shortfalls identified by DOT&amp;E. ILTE is a portfolio of related development efforts that will deliver a system of systems to provide a Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) and instrumentation suite that delivers a high fidelity, realistic, real-time capability to measure hardware and personnel performance in modern combat environments. ILTE will enable testing under tactical conditions for small and large-scale operations while integrating network operations and effects in support of the Army Equipment Modernization Plan. ILTE also allows the U.S. Army to test all Current-to-Future weapon systems in a realistic operational environment. ILTE will transition Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) developed performance enhancements and technology upgrades to the operational test command, control, and communications, communications network, weapons system interfaces, vehicle and dismounted-troop kits and peripherals, Global Positioning System (GPS), encryption components, and integrate operational realistic digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools. These tools will collect, store and analyze data from the digital battlefield. Improvements will enable the ILTE system of systems to measure and record accrued damage, levels of exposure, effects of countermeasures, evasive action, and instrument threat vehicles. This capability is required by the operational test community to integrate digital battlefield data collection and analysis tools into the Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs), M1A2 Abrams, M2A4 Bradley, Stryker, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Apache AH-64E, Gray Eagle and other operational tests.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 funds remaining for obligation in FY20 will be used to complete Block 1 of the Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) in support of PM Apache, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and Rifleman Radio. In FY20 operational test instrumentation funding is strategically realigned to Army modernization in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to effect strategic overmatch on current and future battlefields, it is essential that the United States (U.S.) Army provide advanced radar system instrumentation for developmental testing. Since existing range radar instrumentation is aged beyond useful life and cannot adequately support emerging test requirements in areas such as hypersonics, the Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) develops modern instrumentation radars to replace obsolete tracking and surveillance radars at U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command's Developmental Test Command (DTC) activities, which include: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; and Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ. The acquisition of modern instrumentation radar systems will provide the Army with critical testing data essential for the development of next generation technology and advanced system capabilities. The RRRP provides the test centers with improved radar resolution, sensitivity, accuracy, clutter suppression, and reliability. The planned solution to meet program requirements consists of four primary items: Long Range Single Object Tracking Radars (SOTR), Long Range Multiple Object Tracking Radars (MOTR), Medium Range Radars (MRR), and Short Range Radars (SRR). The resulting systems will not only reduce operation and sustainment costs for the ranges, but improve data collection, thus enhancing development of Army systems being tested at these ranges. The current fleet of instrumentation radars located at ATC, RTC, WSTC, and YTC has become antiquated to the extent that they are not able to support the test needs of the test centers. 

This Project will procure commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and/or modified commercial off-the-shelf (MOTS) radars for both the MRR and SRR solutions, and a combination of recapitalization and COTS/MOTS replacement for the FPS-16 Long Range Radars (LRR). Also, the program will conduct Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for upgrading three MPS-39 Long Range MOTRs.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 request of $94.760 million continues procurement of MRRs and LRRs and provides acceptance testing of Medium, Long, and MPS-39 MOTR radars. The significant increase in requested program funding from FY 2019 to FY 2020 procures seven additional radars, accelerating the program by one year. This strategic acceleration aligns RRRP with developmental testing requirements emerging from Army Modernization efforts in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) Project will develop and produce Warrior-representative ATDs that incorporate realistic, biomechanically-validated injury features and assessment tools to better characterize dynamic events and injury risks measured in Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation (LFT&amp;E) and vehicle development efforts. This capability is comprised of an ATD system built for the Title 10 LFT&amp;E environment and associated biomechanics data and analysis tools. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with underbody blast (UBB) events. Consequently, current LFT&amp;E crew survivability assessment devices are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for Under Body Blast (UBB) events. The device produced by this Project will be used to satisfy a critical need for scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In 2016 the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE) designated the Program Manager for Instrumentation, Target and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) as the Office of Primary Responsibility for Acquisition Blue Teams, to provide management and execution of relevant Cyber Blue Team assessment capabilities in support of the acquisition and test communities. Cyber Blue Teams refer to the cyber team which works cooperatively with the system owner to ensure programs can defend against attackers and/or Red Teams. These Cyber Blue Team capabilities are essential to enable military operators to assess and defeat the presence of cyber security threats across Army networks. PM ITTS will also serve as the primary point of contact for cyber-related testing and vulnerabilities assessments with U.S. Cyber Command and Army Cyber. This Project executes the establishment and management of certification standards for Acquisition Blue Teams and coordination of Blue Team requirements on behalf of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA ALT).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds the RAND Arroyo Center, the Department of the Army's Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) for studies and analysis. The Arroyo Center draws researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines. Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations: Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas: Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology. The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid/long-term concerns. Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues. Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and Army major commands. The Arroyo Center receives Army guidance through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology). The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan. Each research project is sponsored by a General Officer (or Senior Executive Service (SES) equivalent) who is continually involved in research evaluation and feedback. RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) is unique in the Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) portfolio due to the comprehensive scope of RDTE funding at United States (U.S.) Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll, directly supporting eleven leased islands with radars, telemetry, and optics in support of continuous New Foreign Launch surveillance, space surveillance, space object identification, offensive and defensive strategic ballistic and interceptor missile testing. In addition, responsibilities include provision of the totality of the logistics and municipal services required to maintain a strategically vital mission support infrastructure in a remote Pacific island chain 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. Kwajalein's flexible electromagnetic frequency spectrum, equatorial locale, deep water, and unmatched instrumentation make the nation's space and missile operations possible. In addition, the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS) on Kwajalein is the Department of Defense's (DoD) only land-impact missile testing site, providing an increasingly vital Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) capability. 

The U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll / Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (USAKA/RTS), located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is a remote, secure activity of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). USAKA/RTS supports test and evaluation of major Army and DoD missile and space acquisition programs and provides New Foreign Launch surveillance and space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), the U.S. Air Force, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs. USAG-KA provides Base Operations (BOS), Infrastructure and Services (Projects DW7, DW8, and DW9) support to the USAKA/RTS mission and other resident Programs (i.e. Army missile defense, Air Force &amp; Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Air Force Space Fence, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational /demonstration/ validation tests; USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (including contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and space experiments). Base Operations Services at Kwajalein Atoll are conducted predominantly through a contracted workforce with governmental oversight. These PE-funded contracts provide: installation/base operations and maintenance for all facilities, logistics, and security; power generation fuel supporting the installation and radars; transportation; and mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. 

The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) utilizes Project DX2 to provide civilian pay, manpower service contracts, supporting Information Technology (IT), equipment, and associated costs specifically identified and measurable to plan, manage, coordinate, and execute Information Technology Services Management at Army Kwajalein Test Ranges. This Project provides C4IM services in accordance with the Department of Army Pamphlet (DA PAM) PAM 25-1-1 and the Army C4IM Services List.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Army Concepts Experimentation Program supports current and future concepts and capabilities involving Soldiers and Leaders within live, virtual, and constructive environments by exploring concepts, capability requirements and solutions across Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) domains. The purpose of Concepts Experimentation is to clarify and mitigate risk for current and future forces. Experiments and projects inform Army futures concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent user requirements in the future Army. Army experiments use the combined resources of Army Battle Laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinement, and assessment of future force concepts. Simulated Experiments (SIMEX) will integrate and assess Army Concepts and Force Design phases with Army-level issues across the breadth of a campaign that highlights validation and integration of Force 2025 outcomes.

This Program Element (PE) enhances Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) development in support of Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for acquisition milestone decisions. This PE provides for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) to address current critical operational needs, enabling development and deployment/employment of accelerated capabilities (both materiel and non-materiel) to the current force. Early Synthetic Prototyping enables a wargaming and experimentation capability that engages soldiers across the Army through early-fidelity game environments to gain their insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. This PE provides funding for Army Warfighter Assessments (AWA) that physically integrate, assess and evaluate networked capability sets and other adaptive capabilities to accelerate the systems acquisition process of providing DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army. This PE also provides support to the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFC) used by the Army to frame learning and collaboration.

The Soldier-Centered Analysis For Future Force Project (33B) will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. These efforts include design analyses, constructive simulations, and Soldier-in-the loop assessments to ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered, avoiding information and physical task overloads and taking optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Enabled the Army to conduct early fidelity exploration of Doctrine, Organization and Materiel solution through exposure of Soldiers to new innovative ideas and material. Established a continuing collaboration, feedback, and electronic analytical collection capability which captured, through simulated application of future force prototype concepts, explicit qualitative feedback of Soldiers experience gathered from simulated environments intertwined with surveys, polls, and discussion boards. Directed SIMEXs leverage unique support analytics which capture Soldier and Team interactions during virtual small unit, first-person operating environment events, from shooter engagements to high-tempo teaming events. These experiments integrate and assess Army Concepts, Force Designs, and Capabilities to support Force 2025 and Beyond Maneuvers. The goal is to develop, refine, and validate prerequisite Force 2025 and Beyond Concepts, Operational and Organization Plans, and DOTMLPF solutions to achieve a consistent, adaptable vision of the Army's Force in the near, mid, and far terms. 

Experiments empowered participants to explore innovative techniques and participate in equipment and material design options which enabled the Maneuver Battle Lab to be innovative in partnering with Department of Defense (DoD) Research and Development organizations in the development of solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges that would be assessed through further iterations of Army Experimentation. In FY18 this effort leveraged design of a high echelon, strategic environment which examines how units organize and employ future capabilities on the battlefield. The Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues, through a distributive network capability to support the Army Level Acquisition Design and merge with the Experimentation Mission while leveraging and sharing the expense of the Battle Labs to interject a new dynamic interactive process into proponent missions. As Soldiers explored new ideas, concepts, material, and doctrine, they employed new techniques in coordination with the development of requirements documents, providing improved insight into requirements design during the conceptual development stage rather than post-construction.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project enables Army Capability Development and Integration Programs to support the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). These efforts involve integrating Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) to ensure coordinated and integrated acquisition Milestone decisions in a timely manner. Funding in this Project ensures that the Army Futures Command (AFC) / Future Concepts Center (FCC) acts independently and serves as the voice of the warfighter, complementing the materiel developer in providing total capability management that integrates all doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) considerations. These resource requirements provide AFC and FCC resources to execute as lead for Accelerated Capability Development (ACD) and central coordination for Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). These requirements support critical research, development, test and evaluation for Early Synthetic Prototyping and enable war-gaming and experimentation that engages soldiers across the Army to gain insights and recommendations in the development of future doctrine, organization, and materiel solutions. FCC integrates accelerated capabilities development activities between Army proponent force modernization managers as well as Joint / Sister Service coordination. AFC/FCC conducts Joint Warfighter Assessments to physically integrate, assess and evaluate adaptive capability sets to accelerate the systems acquisition process that provides DOTMLPF recommendations to the Army.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project will provide early application of human performance and human figure modeling tools in the development of Soldier-focused requirements to shape technology for Future Force development. Efforts include design analyses, constructive simulations, and Soldier-in-the-loop assessments to ensure that manpower requirements and workload and skill demands are considered, avoiding information and physical task overloads and taking optimum advantage of aptitudes, individual and collective training, and numbers of Soldiers for an affordable Future Force. 

The cited work is consistent with the Strategic Planning Guidance, the Army Science and Technology Master Plan (ASTMP), the Army Modernization Plan, and the Defense Technology Area Plan (DTAP). 

Work in this Project is performed by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>In FY 2018 this effort conducted an analysis of the Army?s Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) process to identify Human System Integration issues, develop algorithms to automate the PMCS level ten process and conduct experiments to demonstrate that the PMCS process can be automated (resulting in a reduction of training requirements and entry errors to Global Combat Support System (GCSS)-Army, fewer errors in maintenance work orders / parts orders, and significant reduction in maintenance man hours to perform the PMCS mission). In order to enable early assessment of future combat vehicle interior crew station designs, this effort performed verification and validation of proposed crew station designs using a fixed-heel point accommodation model. To construct vehicle models compatible with human figure modeling analysis in support of the Route Clearance Interrogation System (RCIS) program, this effort developed a rapid modeling technique incorporating portable handheld laser scanning technology and point cloud reduction software. For improved assessment of future aviation and ground platforms, this effort developed a human figure modeling methodology for determining seat placement of encumbered manikin sets. Finally, this effort also improved the accuracy of threat prediction algorithms to support command mission planning and course of action analyses and developed apps to support anthropometric data collection and analysis.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>In 2017, the Army programmed ATEC?s top six Military Construction (MILCON) projects, in response to Congressional interest in the lack of investment and sustainment of Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFBs) and the associated risk to the development of future technology. This unanticipated event has resulted in an emergent requirement for the necessary Mission Unique Equipment (MUE) associated with each project. MUE includes items that are movable and not affixed as an integral part of the facility, but are required to perform the mission of the facility.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides critical front-end investments for development of new test methodologies, test standards, advanced test technology concepts for long range requirements, future test capabilities, and advanced instrumentation prototypes for subordinate commands of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing. A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This Project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems, upgrades to existing radars to extend their economic life, common data collection and analysis tools, non-intrusive instrumentation to test Unmanned Ground Vehicles and sensors, high speed - high definition digital imaging systems to capture missile flight events, and automation software to improve data collection of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) plans, conducts and reports on operational tests, assessments and experiments in order to provide essential information for the acquisition and fielding of War Fighting Systems. Operational Test (OT) Modeling Simulation and Instrumentation (MS&amp;I) collects required data from systems under test and the systems which they integrate with to support effectiveness, survivability, and suitability analyses. These systems also provide real-time position location and status tracking to support test control. The Army's Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making enhancement of live forces through simulation essential for testing in realistic, operational environments by simulating tactical engagements, additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. ATEC OT MS&amp;I funding is used to adapt capabilities from other organizations (including within ATEC), purchase commercial off-the-shelf systems, and develop and sustain OT-unique simulation and instrumentation systems. As required, the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development and integration of major simulation and instrumentation systems such as Integrated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) Test Environment (ILTE). The MS&amp;I (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds objective vulnerability assessment products necessary for the inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center (ATEC/ AEC) mission, for the Research and Development communities as well as the Analytical communities. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, experimenting and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army and threat systems. Products are leveraged within the Army Futures Command and the Program Manager / Program Executive Office (PM/PEO) community to exercise constructive design influence over materiel development and to provide credible engineering-level underpinning and input to the Army Analytical Community. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this PE are also directly leveraged for urgent materiel releases and support to current operations.

This PE provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army pursues its modernization priorities and ensures readiness through the fielding of lethal and survivable systems for multi-domain operations. PE funds engineering level SLV analysis in the areas of Long Range Precision Fires systems, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, Future Vertical Lift, Network/C3I, Air &amp; Missile Defense, Soldier Lethality, and other highest Army priority efforts in the threat competencies of ballistics, electronic warfare, and cyber. 

Vulnerability assessments funded by this PE are conducted across the spectrum of multi-domain battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cyber threats from insiders to external nation states; and directed energy weapons. Many different kinds of technical capabilities are used to generate these analyses, including specialized equipment, modeling &amp; simulation, and experimental facilities. This PE ensures these capabilities can represent a credible live, virtual, or constructive hostile environment required for vulnerability assessment, thus enabling evaluators, developers, users, and decision makers to make informed SLV judgments for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability and lethality details: enable properly informed decisions concerning acquisition and production; maximize Army overmatch in systems and tactics; inform investment priorities; and mitigate system weaknesses prior to actual combat. 

Technical data and analysis results funded by this PE are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures accurate and consistent treatment of survivability and lethality across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's analytical community as it conducts analyses of alternatives and other studies. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and ATEC/AEC integrate the SLV work program into Army's formal Evaluation process to ensure ATEC can comply with its legally-mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds objective vulnerability assessment products necessary for the inherently-governmental Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command/Army Evaluation Center (ATEC/ AEC) mission, for the Research and Development communities as well as the Analytical communities. Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, experimenting and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest-priority Army and threat systems. Products are leveraged within the Army Futures Command and the Program Manager / Program Executive Office (PM/PEO) community to exercise constructive design influence over materiel development and to provide credible engineering-level underpinning and input to the Army Analytical Community. While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this Project are also directly leveraged for urgent materiel releases and support to current operations.

This Project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army pursues its modernization priorities and ensures readiness through the fielding of lethal and survivable systems for multi-domain operations. This Project funds engineering level SLV analysis in the areas of Long Range Precision Fires systems, Next Generation Combat Vehicles, Future Vertical Lift, Network/C3I, Air &amp; Missile Defense, Soldier Lethality, and other highest Army priority efforts in the threat competencies of ballistics, electronic warfare, and cyber. 

Vulnerability assessments funded by this Project are conducted across the spectrum of multi-domain battlefield threats to include: guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; cyber threats from insiders to external nation states; and directed energy weapons. Many different kinds of technical capabilities are used to generate these analyses, including specialized equipment, modeling &amp; simulation, and experimental facilities. This Project ensures these capabilities can represent a credible live, virtual, or constructive hostile environment required for vulnerability assessment, thus enabling evaluators, developers, users, and decision makers to make informed SLV judgments for both Soldiers and materiel. These technical survivability and lethality details: enable properly informed decisions concerning acquisition and production; maximize Army overmatch in systems and tactics; inform investment priorities; and mitigate system weaknesses prior to actual combat. 

Technical data and analysis results funded by this Project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers. Central funding of this mission assures accurate and consistent treatment of survivability and lethality across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's analytical community as it conducts analyses of alternatives and other studies. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and ATEC/AEC integrate the SLV work program into Army's formal Evaluation process to ensure ATEC can comply with its legally-mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification Program Element (PE) ensures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. This PE provides independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62 ("Airworthiness of Aircraft Systems"), and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This PE performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems. This PE also provides: management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support for major development/modification and future systems/subsystems requirements of the Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO AVN) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO); and management of test and evaluation processes in support of the airworthiness qualification process. 

The Airworthiness Certification PE also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models. Ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification include the following PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems: Longbow Apache E-model; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and modified Shadow UAS. Additionally, the Airworthiness Certification PE supports the application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including the following Aircraft Survivability Equipment: Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband avionics and Tactical Radio Systems and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker. 

Finally, this PE also provides: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects (e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Airworthiness Certification Project assures safe flight operation of Army aircraft and aviation systems by means of technical design approval and qualification of systems to appropriate airworthiness standards. This Project supports independent airworthiness qualification for all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by Army Regulation (AR) 70-62 ("Airworthiness of Aircraft Systems"), and is essential for assuring the safe operation of Army aircraft. This Project performs engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft. This Project also supports: management/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support for major development/modification and future systems/ subsystems requirements of the Program Executive Officer for Aviation (PEO AVN) and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO); and management of test and evaluation processes in support of the airworthiness qualification process.
The Airworthiness Certification Project also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models, and supports the application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft. 

This Project also supports: airworthiness certification for military-use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in senior leadership mandated airworthiness tri-service activities (e.g., National Airworthiness Council) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS)); and early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects such as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, Advanced Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Modular Open System Architecture, and other Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides meteorological support to research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) activities and provides standard and specialized weather forecasts and data to satisfy Army/Department of Defense (DoD) RDTE test requirements for modern weaponry. Types of support include: (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target-to-background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go/no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety. This PE provides technical weather support to Army and Joint Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at: White Sands Test Center (WSTC), White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Yuma Test Center (YTC), Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, Alaska); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This PE develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army/DoD RDTE requirements. It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers along with replacement/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems. Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel/weapons developers and project/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R (Department of Defense Financial Management Regulations). This PE enables more effective test scheduling and execution, and is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental and operational test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) civilians at the United States (U.S.) Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) to conduct responsive and effective materiel systems analysis to support modernization solutions for the U.S. Army Future Force. AMSAA conducts systems and engineering analyses to support Army decisions in technology, materiel acquisition, and the design, development, fielding, and sustainment of Army weapon/materiel systems. As part of this mission, AMSAA develops and certifies system level performance data used in Army studies, and develops item-level performance methodology and Models and Simulations (M&amp;S) for the current and future operational environment and emerging threats.  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for developing, maintaining, improving, verifying, validating, and accrediting item-level performance data and M&amp;S for combat effects and logistics.  This includes the development and maintenance of common data formats. In support of its materiel systems analysis mission, AMSAA analyzes the performance and combat effectiveness of conceptual, developmental, and fielded systems. Unique models and methodologies have been developed to predict critical performance variables, such as weapon accuracy, target acquisition, rate of fire, probability of inflicting catastrophic damage, personnel and vehicle survivability, mobility, system reliability and several additional capability areas. AMSAA generates performance and effectiveness measures and ensures their standard use across major Army and Joint studies. AMSAA conducts and supports various systems analysis efforts across the entire materiel system life cycle, such as: Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs); analytical support to Cross-Functional Teams (CFTs); system cost/performance tradeoffs and early technology tradeoffs to inform system and acquisition program risk assessments; weapons/systems mix analyses; business case analyses; cost benefit analyses; requirements analyses; technology insertion studies; reliability growth studies; Physics of Failure (PoF) analyses; Schedule and Technical Risk evaluations, and analytical support for Test and Evaluation. These analyses are used by leadership within HQDA (both Army Staff and Assistant Secretaries in the HQDA Secretariat), Army Materiel Command, Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Training and Doctrine Command, Army Test and Evaluation Command, Program Executive Officers/Project Managers, Army Futures Command (AFC) and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)/Department of Defense (DoD). AMSAA's inclusion as one of the central members of the Future Modernization Analysis Center of the Army Futures Command illustrates the critical contributions the organization has and continues to make in supporting Acquisition Modernization decisions.

AMSAA analyses and data are used by these organizations in making acquisition, procurement, and logistics decisions in order to provide quality equipment and procedures to the Soldier, along with enhancing and sustaining readiness for the Current and Future Force. AMSAA's M&amp;S capabilities support the development, linkage, and accreditation of live, virtual, and constructive simulations, and provide unique tools that support systems analysis of individual systems and the combined-arms environment. AMSAA maintains over 75 models and simulations, both internally developed to address specific analytical requirements. This M&amp;S infrastructure provides a hierarchical modeling framework that is unique to AMSAA and allows for a comprehensive performance and effectiveness prediction capability that can be utilized to make trade-off and investment decisions prior to extensive and expensive hardware testing of proposed systems/technologies for the readiness of the Current and Future Force.  

AMSAA exercises HQDA responsibility for Army reliability methodology development. In this role, as the Army's Executive Agent for reliability and maintainability (R&amp;M) standardization improvement, AMSAA develops and implements R&amp;M reform initiatives that support acquisition decisions and life cycle management. AMSAA develops and applies engineering approaches that assess the reliability of Army materiel and provides recommendations on ways to improve reliability, thereby reducing logistics footprints and life cycle costs, and extending failure-free periods for deployed equipment. AMSAA's electronic and mechanical PoF program pioneered the Army's involvement in utilizing computer-aided engineering tools in the analysis of root-cause failure mechanisms at the component level during the system design process. AMSAA's reliability engineering and PoF tools/analyses have been used extensively to support the design improvement of developmental and fielded systems used in Current Operations, resulting in improved reliability, reduced Operating and Support costs, and reduced logistics expenditures and footprints. AMSAA, in conjunction with the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), form the Center for Reliability Growth, which develops critical tools, methodologies, policies, formal guidance, and educational materials needed to help acquisition programs achieve their required reliability during the acquisition process. The reliability improvements achieved for major weapon systems translates into billions of dollars in operating and support cost savings over the life cycle.

AMSAA's unique analytical capabilities are supporting AEC/Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to assess and determine the essential analytical requirements to enhance Army evaluations and reduce extensive testing. AMSAA's support in this area improves evaluation products and results in better materiel solutions to the Warfighter. AMSAA assists in systems evaluations which support various Acquisition Category (ACAT) materiel system decisions, and provides quick response analyses in support of rapid initiatives for Current Operations.

As the Army's center for materiel systems analysis, AMSAA provides the technical capability to support Army and DoD decision makers throughout the entire acquisition process in responding to analytical requirements across the full spectrum of materiel. AMSAA's unique in-house, consistent, integrated analytical capability is a critical asset that provides Army leadership with timely, independent, unbiased, reliable, and high quality analysis to support complex decisions required for Current Operations and the development of the Future Force. AMSAA's integrated set of skills and tools are focused on its core mission to develop and deliver Analytical Solutions to enable Readiness.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides resources to the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) to operate the Army Joint Test Element (JTE) and the Army's Operational Test Command (OTC). JTE examines Joint Service, Combatant Command (COCOM) and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies' mission gaps, tactics and doctrine, resulting in the development of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and assessment documents. Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. OTC conducts independent operational tests that provide significant data to Army decision-makers on key Army systems and concepts. This PE finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Products are developed through operational non-materiel solutions to urgent, specific, Joint Warfighter problems. The JTE coordinates and develops nominations for Quick Reaction Tests (QRTs) and Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS); serves as the Operational Test Agency (OTA) for Army-led QRTs; and coordinates resources to support Joint Feasibility Studies and chartered Joint Tests (JT) under the Joint Test Unit (JTU) assigned to the Army test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) as the joint OTA.  Mission support for JTE includes supporting two Joint Tests under the Joint Test program, and assigned special projects. ATEC provides military resource support to Nellis Air Force Base, Suffolk VA, United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) J81 (Hawaii), and Marine Corps Warfighter Laboratory (Quantico, VA) with Officer and Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) support. JTE supports Joint Tests until these Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) chartered projects are completed and transitioned to the respective Sponsoring COCOM.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding to United States (U.S.) Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command (ATEC) to operate the Operational Test Command (OTC). OTC conducts independent operational tests required by public law (Title 10 USC 2399) that provide significant data to Army decision makers on key Army systems and concepts. This Project finances recurring costs for OTC that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training. These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, training, supplies and equipment.  

OTC consists of four forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air and Missile Defense Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; Fires Support Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and the Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate, Fort Huachuca, Arizona) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Fort Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), Limited User Test (LUT), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides the resources to operate the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), the United States (U.S.) Army's independent evaluator of Technical Requirements and Critical Operational Issues and Criteria for all Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) and other programs. AEC is the lead agent to plan, direct and evaluate all required program testing. AEC is the focal point in test strategy development, system safety verification, and data analyses from early developmental consumer tests through operational tests. AEC provides critical independent assessments on the effectiveness, suitability, and survivability to include cyber and electronic warfare; safety of materiel solutions; and viability of emerging technologies and engineering change proposals in order to support major acquisition/fielding decisions including but not limited to acquisition milestones, materiel changes, and materiel releases.  

AEC is responsible for all assigned developmental and independent operational evaluation of Army materiel, information and acquisition systems, an inherently governmental mission. AEC assists the Chief of Staff of the Army decision making process by supporting Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC) processes as well as supporting the Army Futures Command through the Cross Functional Team (CFT) concept. AEC evaluates operational effectiveness by determining if the system provides intended benefits to the Force. AEC determines impacts to readiness through Human Systems Integration (HSI), Unit Systems Integration (USI), and Army Systems Integration (ASI), DOTMLPF-P impacts, integrated suitability reviews (ISR) and operational suitability reviews (OSR) in partnership with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition Policy and Logistics (DASA APL). AEC evaluates ballistics survivability and lethality missions, adversarial assessments/threat computer network operations, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (CVPA), and electronic warfare (EW) (attack, support) countermeasures in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2016 Section 1647, Establishment of Cybersecurity and Electromagnetic Affects (CEMA). AEC manages, plans, and executes Information Assurance (IA) operational assessments during annual Combatant Command and Army Service exercises in support of the congressionally mandated Office of the Secretary of Defense Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (OSD DOT&amp;E) assessment, and performs the operational test agency (OTA) duties for the Ballistic Missile Defense System.

This PE funds direct civilian labor and minimum non-labor requirements to include: Temporary Duty (TDY), personnel training, career development, supplies and equipment, hardware, software, and other external Other Government Agency (OGA) support as well as methodology development required to evaluate emerging technologies and instrumentation requirements.

AEC consists of seven directorates (Aviation-Fires Evaluation Directorate, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Evaluation Directorate (funded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA)), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Evaluation Directorate, Integrated Suitability &amp; Methodology Directorate, Mounted Systems Evaluation Directorate, Soldier &amp; Support System Evaluation Directorate and Survivability Evaluation Directorate) and a lean headquarters element as AEC receives staff services from the Army Test and Evaluation Command Headquarters (ATEC HQ). The AEC primary competencies are: identify what decision makers need to know; plan and direct test and evaluation strategies; evaluate operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability and safety; and provide senior leadership unbiased advice on Army programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) promotes the Army's Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) strategy, defined by five guiding priorities: (1) formulate Army M&amp;S policies; (2) develop and employ management processes for models, simulations and data; (3) develop M&amp;S standards, architectures, networks and environments; (4) develop/employ new M&amp;S tools and simulation technology; (5) develop an M&amp;S workforce. Specifically, this PE focuses on priorities 3 and 4.

M&amp;S Standards, Architectures, Networks and Environments: The consistent use of standards, architectures, networks and environments advances the goal of interoperability. The Army coordinates with Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) partners along with industry and academia to develop/employ standards that promote collaboration and facilitate the sharing of tools, data and information. The Army oversees procedures and processes for the appropriate use of standards to foster common formats and increase M&amp;S and data reuse. The Army ensures these standards, architectures, networks and environments are readily accessible and can be reliably applied by users.

M&amp;S Tools and Simulation Technology: The Army must have credible M&amp;S tools and data to support the full range of Army organizational missions and functional responsibilities. M&amp;S results that are timely and credible enhance decision making. The Army must develop and accredit reliable M&amp;S tools so that decision makers and senior leaders benefit from the results and thus support the continued development, integration and use of such tools. To ensure credibility and reliability of results, M&amp;S managers, developers and users must make the capabilities, constraints, limitations and assumptions of their M&amp;S tools readily accessible. PE 0605718A provides for the development and employment of tools in the form of models, simulations and data that support the full range of Army interests and deliver timely information to enhance effective decision making. Moreover, these tools can be documented, verified, validated and accredited for their intended purpose in order to provide timely, credible results.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army Science Board (ASB) is a federal advisory committee, organized under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Government in the Sunshine Act, which provides the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of Defense with independent and transparent advice and recommendations on matters relating to scientific, technical, manufacturing, acquisition, logistics, and business management functions. The ASB dates to November 1951 when the Secretary of the Army, Honorable Frank Pace Jr., appointed twelve outstanding scientists and industrialists to a scientific advisory panel to assist him and the Army's leadership in creating an effective, economical, and progressive fighting force using existing technology and industrial resources. Three years later, this panel was expanded and officially designated the Army Scientific Advisory Panel (ASAP), with its first formal meeting held on November 16, 1954. In 1977, with the passage of FACA, the ASB was created to replace the ASAP.

The ASB provides the Army with a resource of world-class scientists, engineers, technologists and operational experts as well as business, policy and managerial specialists from the private sector, academia, non-DoD government agencies and former senior military officers. Its members volunteer their expertise and time to address those critical national security challenges for which the Army's leadership seeks independent and unbiased technical advice. The ASB focuses on issues of importance to large segments of the Army, and its products are delivered in a candid and timely manner.

The Board is composed of 20 voting and 20 non-voting members, each serving three-year terms, and consultants who serve one-year terms. Membership is carefully monitored to ensure that diverse disciplines and points of view are represented. The Secretary of the Army appoints the Chair and Vice Chair from the ASB membership. The ASB Chair also serves as a non-voting observer to the Defense Science Board. ASB membership is augmented by a small number of consultants who are appointed to provide specialized expertise for ASB studies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Army Science Board (ASB)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The ASB Charter sets the estimated number of Board meetings at four per year. Board members serve without compensation, with the exception of reimbursement for official Board-related travel and per diem. Funds are therefore required to facilitate Board activities and related subcommittee activities. The ASB Charter states that annual requirements will typically entail a personnel cost of seven Full-Time Equivalents.

Currently, the Secretary of the Army has approved four permanent subcommittees to the Board:

1) The Army Science Board Basic Science and Disruptive Technologies Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's basic research and disruptive technologies, including Soldier performance enhancement, cognition improvement, and training; autonomous systems and human-machine teaming; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and high-yield Explosives (CBRNE); and counter Weapons of Mass Destruction.

2) The Army Science Board Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's C41SR core competency, including the tactical edge C3, situational awareness overmatch, and electronic warfare.

3) The Army Science Board Systems Engineering, Integration, and Sustainment Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses relating to the Army's core competency in systems engineering and integration; advanced prototyping and experimentation in operational environments; and sustainment, including engineered resilient systems, agile logistics and health management. These competencies are essential to the performance of the entire acquisition community.

4) the Army Science Board Weapon Systems Subcommittee is composed of not more than 15 members and addresses issues relating to the Army's weapon systems core competency in: Rotorcraft Design Synthesis &amp; Performance Assessment (DS&amp;PA) and airworthiness/safety; ground combat vehicle DS&amp;PA, Soldier interaction, and system integration; lethality, including impact physics, energetics, warhead DS&amp;PA, effects modeling and simulation; survivability and protection, including armor and balanced approach for detection/hit/kill avoidance; and air and missile defense DS&amp;PA, precision fires, seekers, and precision guidance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The United States (U.S.) Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) is the only Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory that conducts research to enhance the Soldier lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, leader development) and human relations (e.g. culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). This Project supports the non-AMHA (Army Management Headquarters Activity) management and administrative functions to enable ARI to accomplish its research mission and includes activities such as budget execution, procurement oversight, Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) program planning and evaluation, management control, security/safety, logistics, information technology, and personnel/manpower execution and oversight. ARI's behavioral and social science research provides effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This Project partially funds the travel costs and administrative support (studies, analysis, interpretation, equipment, etc.) required to participate in international forums, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Army Armaments Group (NAAG), Defense Against Terrorism (DAT) and to pursue new cooperative R&amp;D initiatives and international cooperative agreements such as memoranda of understanding. This Project also includes the United States' share of costs of the NATO Civil Budget, Chapter IX, which funds the NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) and the Special Fund for Cooperative Planning (U.S. Army is Executive Agent for this NATO bill). This Project also partially funds the Five Power Senior National Representatives, Army (SNR (A)), the Technical Cooperative Program, Bilateral SNR(A)s, and Army armaments working groups with many nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports upgrading the accuracy, timeliness, availability, and accessibility of scientific, technical, and management information at all levels of the Army Research and Development (R&amp;D) community. Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership. Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&amp;T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues. This PE includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation, along with initiatives to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&amp;T knowledge management information technology and to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 (Projects 720 and 727). This PE also addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers. Project 730 provides funding for assessments in attitudes and opinions, longitudinal trends in Soldier and leader perceptions, and emerging issues that provide senior Army leaders with information on Soldiers' perceptions to inform personnel policy and program decision-making concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues. Project 731 provides funding for support for Army high performance computing centers. Project 733 provides funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process, while Project C16 supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems. Project DW3 supports Army Geospatial Enterprise (AGE) Implementation with systems engineering, architecture, and test and certification of Army Acquisition Systems. Finally, this PE funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (Project C18). Coordination of this PE with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.

The cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

                                <r2:Description>Army SBIR and Army STTR programs. In 1982, Congress, through the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219) established the SBIR program to foster the involvement of US based small businesses in federal research and development (R&amp;D). The SBIR program is designed to increase the participation of small, high-technology firms in the federal R&amp;D endeavor and give driven businesses the opportunity to provide innovative R&amp;D solutions in response to critical Army needs. The STTR program expands the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small business and the nation's premier nonprofit research institutions. The most important role of the STTR program is to foster the innovation necessary to meet the nation's scientific and technological challenges in the 21st century. The SBIR/STTR support services include program and technical advisory support services on a broad level. The Army SBIR/STTR Program Management Office mission requires synergized, integrated business solutions that concentrates on small business technological advances, and eliminates redundancy in a codified and consistent method that reduces confusion and ambiguity for the thousands of small businesses that participate in the SBIR and STTR programs.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides support for the Field Assistance in Science and Technology (FAST) program. The FAST program provides Science Advisors, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide. FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) costs. The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers. The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&amp;S savings. FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers an Annual Program Review to facilitate sharing of lessons learned between science advisors at combatant commands, assists Combatant Commanders (COCOMS) with their annual Science and Technology Conferences. FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office). FAST supports warfighters in contingency operations with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports continuing technology investigations by providing a coordinated Tri-Service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  

Project 296 - This Project will support research, development and testing to identify, characterize and resolve reliability, safety, storage and manufacturing issues that impact production availability and field use of demolitions, grenades, shoulder launched munitions, mines and mine clearing charges and pyrotechnics, including training realism.  Project will result in the development and demonstration of new, safe, reliable and environmentally acceptable munitions.

Project 297 - Munitions Survivability &amp; Logistics: This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply. Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements. Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness. Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated. The early stages of force deployment are especially critical. Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets. These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater. Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life. This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.

Project 857 - DoD Explosives Safety Standards: This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board. It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards. Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion-resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard/protection criteria.

Project 858 - Army Explosives Safety Management Program: This Project establishes, validates or modifies explosives technical safety requirements per Department of Defense Manual 6055.09 and Department of the Army Pamphlet 385-64, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. Project activities promote Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) of new and innovative explosives safety technologies that improve the survivability of Army personnel, facilities, and equipment as well as improve the health, safety and welfare of the general public (with highest priority directed to combat theater of operations).

Project 859 - Life Cycle Pilot Process: This Project supports the implementation of the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan through technology investigations, model based process controls, pilot prototyping, and industrial assessments. It will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements, and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products. Cost reduction is an important part of the Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP). LCPP provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation. In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs) / No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB). LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.

Project F21: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ammunition Evaluation program funding ensures interchangeability of direct fire ammunition and weapons among all the NATO countries with all of the associated logistic, strategic and tactical advantages of the alliance. The Project involves development and testing compliance of NATO standardization agreements (STANAGS) and staffing of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC). In addition, this Project supports small caliber ammunition, 40mm grenade munitions, medium caliber cannon ammunition, and large caliber ammunition enhancements to lethality, effectiveness, survivability, accuracy, and general product improvements. This Project also supports the standardization and interchangeability of legacy and new production U.S. weapons and ammunition with Allied Nations to maximize battlefield interchangeability/compatibility under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU). Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will also potentially increase Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of U.S. indirect fire Weapon and Munition products to support United States industrial base production and affordable Department of Defense pricing through increased economies of scale. FY 2020 funding will support NATO and JBMOU artillery and small arms ammunition interchangeability group meetings, documentation, and test operations.  

Project F24: Conventional Munitions Demilitarization (Demil): The Conventional Munitions Demilitarization technology Project supports the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) responsibility per Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5160.68 to plan, program, budget and fund a Joint Service Research and Development (R&amp;D) program that develops capability and capacity as well as technology and facilities to support the SMCA mission to demil and dispose of conventional ammunition stored in the SMCA Resource, Recovery and Disposition Account (B5A).  The program goals include SMCA efforts to increase efficiencies and effectiveness to reduce the demil stockpile; reduce processing costs including packaging, handling and crating; and increase capacity through improved demilitarization capabilities and processes. Project F24 includes activities: (1) to establish requirements and develop processes to focus investments, assess capabilities, analyze alternatives, and recommend and implement R&amp;D projects; (2) to improve products and processes that support existing capabilities; (3) to develop or improve demil methods and processes related to advance the primary demilitarization core thrust areas of destruction, disassembly, removal, resource recovery and recycling, and waste stream treatment; (4) to ensure safe and environmentally acceptable demil operations; (5) to transition R&amp;D products to United States Army depots or plants as well as commercial facilities performing demil; and (6) to mitigate risk and close-out project activities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports the future force by making Army units more survivable through the investigation, testing and demonstration of munitions logistics system improvements that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply. Key thrust areas are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements. Within each thrust area, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness. Optimum, cost effective and efficient solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated. The early stages of force deployment are especially critical. Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets. These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater. Loss of these munition stocks could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life. This Project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project supports continuing technology investigations related to Explosives Safety Standards. It provides a coordinated Tri-Service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.

This Project supports the Research, Development, Test, &amp; Evaluation (RDTE) efforts of the Department of Defense (DoD) Explosive Safety Standards Board. It supports explosive safety effects research and testing to quantify hazards and to develop techniques to mitigate those hazards in all DoD manufacturing, testing, transportation, maintenance, storage, disposal of ammunition and explosives operations, and also to develop risk based explosives safety standards. Results are essential to the development and improvement of quantity-distance standards, hazard classification procedures, cost effective explosion resistant facility design procedures, and personnel hazard/protection criteria.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To execute the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) Industrial Base Strategic Plan, this project supports material and manufacturing technology investigations, assessments, modeling and simulation, pilot / scale-up prototype processes, and industrial assessments.  Projects support overall Army's sustainment and modernization efforts for armaments and ammunition industrial base.  Specifically, this project will assess life cycle production capabilities required for all ammunition families, address design for manufacturability to facilitate economical production, identify industrial and technology requirements and address the ability of the production base to rapidly and cost effectively produce quality products.  Life Cycle Pilot Process (LCPP) provides the resources to prototype critical technologies and develop the knowledge base to establish cost effective, environmentally safe and modern production processes in support of the munitions Industrial Base transformation.  In addition, the LCPP program addresses Single Point Failures (SPFs)/No Source of supply within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB).  LCPP provides support to reduce supply chain risk by investigating, developing and evaluating additional sources of supply for a known SPF.  FY 2020 funding will be used to continue testing and evaluation for new materials, investigations and manufacturing technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds environmental quality technology (EQT)-related management support functions including support of research, development, test and evaluation required for EQT technical integration efforts at demonstration/validation test sites, technical information and activities, test facilities and general test instrumentation, and EQT requirement assessments. Funds support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects. In addition, this PE provides support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address environmental quality requirements under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Program.

The Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition/Logistics Project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change to the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal. The Project involves systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life. It provides support to the system acquisition community (Program and Project Managers) to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process. The goal of the effort is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs, including efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities.

The Pollution Prevention Tech Support Project funds the management support costs to execute the Toxic Metals Reduction, Airborne Lead Reduction, Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP), and Securing the Availability of Green Enhanced Coatings (SAGE-Coat) environmental quality technology programs, which support Cross Functional Teams and the Army's top modernization priorities by addressing potential obsolescence of legacy materials and current and emerging impacts on human health and the environment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland (Project M65 Army Test and Evaluation Command). It also provides funds supporting similar functions at the United States (U.S.) Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (Project XW7 Command HQ - ARI), and provides funds for Army Headquarters to study and improve the Sexual Harassment / Assault Response and Prevention program (Project FJ2 Army SHARP RDTE). 

ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, and assessments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter. Additionally, ATEC is a Direct Support to Army Futures Command (AFC). ATEC provides testing and independent evaluation support to AFC Cross Functional Team (CFT) efforts including risk reduction support to experiments, demonstrations, requirements, research, development, and acquisition. As such, ATEC priorities are aligned to the Army's Modernization priorities. 

Project M65 includes staff/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) at APG, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) at Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~2,400 developmental tests; approximately ~52 operational events; and more than ~900 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs. ATEC's total authorized workforce amounts to a $1.6 billion program in direct and reimbursable funding. 

Project XW7 provides the non-Army Management Headquarters Activity (non-AMHA) management and administrative support that enables the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) to accomplish its research mission and includes personnel/manpower execution and oversight. ARI's behavioral and social science research provides effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints. ARI is the only Science and Technology (S&amp;T) laboratory that conducts research to enhance the Soldier lifecycle (e.g., selection, assignment, training, and leader development) and human relations (e.g., culture of dignity, respect, and inclusion). 

Project FJ2 provides Army Management Headquarters a critical research capability to improve the Army Sexual Harassment / Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program, with a specific focus on prevention.

This PE does not finance test facility operations, test instrumentation, or test equipment.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 this contract achieves three goals: (1) to inform sexual harassment prevention research efforts (e.g., Consortium Research Fellows Program), (2) examine the nature of offending within the military to inform effective sexual assault prevention efforts, and (3) assess the efficacy of training/prevention/outreach efforts related to sexual assault, in particular but not limited to male service members. Ongoing efforts to meet the first goal will explore the nature of sexual harassment in the Army, identify the organizational costs related to harassment (e.g., increased turnover, lower job satisfaction, and job performance), and examine the role of sexual harassment as it relates to sexual assault within the continuum of harm. Based on these studies, the performer will recommend effective sexual harassment prevention strategies. Studies will ensure that Army SHARP programs build climates for dignity and respect free of sexual harassment. Some of these efforts may be achieved through a collaboration with the Consortium Research Fellows Program. 

To meet the second goal, studies will examine behavioral patterns in offending within military sexual assault cases. For instance, behavioral patterns may reveal the nature of military sexual assault or identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead someone to perpetrate sexual assault. Studies may also be informed by offender patterns observed in research using administrative data sources. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to reduce risk of sexual offending behavior, recommend ways to improve skills and abilities that will bolster one's ability to engage in healthy relationships, and inform effective sexual assault prevention practices.

To meet the third goal, research will (1) conduct male-specific assessments and (2) conduct other assessments that will assess the efficacy of training/prevention/outreach efforts related to sexual assault. The research will characterize the behaviors associated with military men's victimization and how they differ from those of service women, men's decision processes to file a formal report of sexual assault, and their experiences with the military sexual assault response systems. In particular, the research will focus on male victimization that occurred during military service rather than childhood sexual assault. Based on this research, the performer will identify ways to improve tailored recommendations for responding to and supporting male victims. This research will improve DoD prevention and response for male Service members. To meet the second part of this goal, the research may conduct assessments to evaluate the efficacy of training/prevention/outreach efforts related to sexual assault. This may involve conducting evaluation research to assess the effectiveness of individual programs or practices. Based on this research, the performer will determine whether these programs are effective and propose ways to improve SHARP efforts. This research will ensure that SHARP programs deliver effective training/prevention/outreach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Funding is required to ensure that Army SHARP is in compliance with multiple Service or DoD requirements. NDAA Requirement S585 (FY 2012) requires the development of SAPR curriculum for Service members and civilian employees, NDAA Requirement 1725c (FY 2014) requires the identification of qualifications needed for Service and civilian personnel who are assigned to positions that include SAPR functions, NDAA Requirement S1733 requires the review of SAPR training and recommendations for modification based on identified inadequacies, and NDAA Requirement S538 (FY 2016) dictates that the Services develop efforts to improve prevention and response for male victims of sexual assault. Conducting research to meet these requirements is a necessary step in ensuring that training, prevention and outreach activities are having the desired effect and impact on the Total Force.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project provides funding for the salaries and related personnel benefits for the authorized civilian personnel positions that provide for the management functions and the technical direction of the United States (U.S.) Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) mission located at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland. ATEC plans, conducts and integrates developmental testing, independent operational testing, independent evaluations, and assessments to provide essential information to Soldiers and acquisition decision makers supporting the American Warfighter.  Additionally, ATEC is a Direct Support to Army Futures Command (AFC). ATEC provides testing and independent evaluation support to AFC Cross Functional Team (CFT) efforts including risk reduction support to experiments, demonstrations, requirements, research, development, and acquisition. As such, ATEC priorities are aligned to the Army's Modernization priorities. 

This Project includes staff/management functions of resource management, human resources, safety, security, environmental, strategic planning and information/ technology support for command-wide databases in support of the developmental, evaluation and operational test mission with technical direction to the Army Evaluation Center (AEC), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; to the Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas which consists of three forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Air Defense Artillery Test Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; and the Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas; and to the seven Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFBs) and one non-MRTFB test range: Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) at APG, Maryland; West Desert Test Center (WDTC) at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona; White Sands Test Center (WSTC) at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Yuma Test Center (YTC) at Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona; Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC) at Fort Greely, Alaska; and Tropic Regions Test Center (TRTC) at various locations, as well as for Redstone Test Center (RTC) at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This is the operating budget for ATEC Headquarters, which provides technical direction for the annual execution of ~2,400 developmental tests; approximately ~52 operational events; and more than ~900 Evaluation and Safety documents supporting acquisition programs. ATEC's total authorized workforce amounts to a $1.6 billion program in direct and reimbursable funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS), with its remote location and one-of-a-kind instrumentation systems, provides a valuable strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. Its function is to: 1) support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs of strategic importance to the national defense; and 2) provide space operations and intelligence data (Space Situational Awareness, object tracking &amp; identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), acting as a high value contributing sensor to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network. Due to its unique geography and instrumentation, RTS is able to provide unmatched data collection capabilities that provide critical test data for programs of national interest to include: Army Missile Defense; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational, demonstration, and validation tests; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs; NASA ionospheric studies; space debris tracking; and data collection in support of space experiments. 

Funding in this Program Element (PE) covers management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). Funds also provide contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. This PE provides contractors to accomplish key operations and maintenance functions for RTS instrumentation suites and also provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. Funds provide the expertise required for operating and maintaining a number of one-of-a-kind radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include: the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site; Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment radars located at RTS are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world, providing critical intelligence data. Funding also enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS. This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense , and Aegis Weapon System), and NASA's space experiments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project covers operations and mission support functions at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site and is managed by Program Executive Office Missiles &amp; Space.

The Reagan Test Site (RTS) with its remote location and one of kind instrumentation systems provides a valuable strategic test environment that cannot be replicated. Its function is to: 1) support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs of strategic importance to the national defense; and 2) to provide space operations and intelligence data (Space Situational Awareness; object tracking &amp; identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), acting as a high value contributing sensor to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network. Due to its unique geography and instrumentation, RTS is able to provide unmatched data collection capabilities to provide critical test data for programs of national interest to include: Army Missile Defense; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency hypersonic Boost-Glide developmental tests; Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) operational/ demonstration/ validation tests; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and unique space programs; NASA ionospheric studies; space debris tracking; and data collection in support of space experiments. 

Funding in this Program Element (PE) covers management and contracting personnel support (salaries and travel) to enable the management of the test and evaluation of major Army and Department of Defense (DoD) missile systems for the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site (RTS). Funds also provide contracting support for end item procurement, life cycle acquisition planning, and solicitation, negotiation, award, execution and management for weapon systems contracts. This PE provides contractors to accomplish key operations and maintenance functions for RTS instrumentation suites and also provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optic cable system. Funds provide the expertise required for operating and maintaining a number of one-of-a-kind radar, optical, telemetry, command/control/communications, safety, and data reduction systems. These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site; Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by ten antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis/reduction hardware/software and Continental United States (CONUS) based mission control center. The Advanced Research Project Agency Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment radars located at RTS are the only radars in this area of operation that have deep-space tracking capability. The Millimeter Wave Radar is one of the highest resolution imaging radars in the world, providing critical intelligence data. Funding also enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS. This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS. Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, ICBM Targets, and Layered Ballistic Missile Defense operational tests (including: PATRIOT, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense , and Aegis Weapon System), and NASA's space experiments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Counterintelligence (CI) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT) Modernization Program Element (PE) supports ongoing rejuvenation and development of new critical CI and HUMINT systems, applications, tools, equipment, and capabilities necessary to defeat foreign intelligence, international terrorist, and insider threats while enhancing our HUMINT collection capability. The required tools provide Army and DoD leadership, commanders, and warfighters the intelligence necessary for making advantageous operational planning, policies, and timely decisions. Modernization of these systems is a core component of ensuring overmatch on current and future battlefields. Beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, funding for these efforts was transferred to PE 0606003 / Project FI9 (Counter Intel and Human Intel Modernization) from PE 0303028A (INTEL SPT TO FORCE XXI) / Project FG2 (Counterintelligence &amp; Human Intel Modernization).

Lines of effort include the following:

The Joint Service Counter C4ISR Initiative conducts technical analyses and research focused on centers of gravity within the C4ISR architecture of adversary weapon systems that enable successful kinetic and non-kinetic engagements. The Army will use the intelligence provided from this effort to inform the development of offensive cyber and advanced electronic warfare capabilities against adversaries as well as countermeasure development against key adversary weapon systems. 

Army HUMINT collection conducted through all phases of the operational spectrum in order to provide DoD Commanders, Planners, and Decision Makers valuable insight of the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign operations, foreign persons, and international terrorism organizations.  Also provides advance HUMINT training using Nationally validated courses, standardized practices, and proven Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures.

The Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems (BICES) Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Web Presence will resource contractor development to deliver software to provide data interoperability between U.S. and BICES networks for GEOINT finished products. The software will provide releasable intelligence data to coalition users that support and partner with US forces to accomplish US policy goals in theater. 

GEOINT Rapid Development will resource contractor development and testing to deliver new GEOINT capabilities to the Army. Tasked work considers current warfighter intelligence gaps and develops potential solutions using tried and untried methodologies for collection, processing, and analysis alongside mission partner programs. The team then validates and tests approaches and delivers the techniques to the warfighter-supporting analyst team to support operations.

Intelligence Needs Integration will resource contractor design, software development, and testing to populate ground component intelligence needs to external intelligence needs systems and provide the results to the ground component customers. Non-Army analysts can then provide intelligence using approaches not currently provided by the Army, giving the ground commander a greater resolution.

The GEOINT Product Catalog will resource contractor design, software development, testing and integration. The delivered software will provide analysts and requirements managers a guided, quick reference tool to choose from the hundreds GEOINT approaches available to close their intelligence gaps.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds cyber vulnerabilities evaluations of major weapon systems in alignment with Section 1647 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, and of critical infrastructure in alignment with Section 1650 of NDAA 2017. Efforts in this PE will: 1) identify, assess, and mitigate operational risk from cyber vulnerabilities as it pertains to critical Army weapon systems in an operational configuration; and 2) assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the information and control systems that underpin Army facilities and critical infrastructure by inventorying and assessing Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS).

Weapon systems evaluations will assess and mitigate operational risk from a peer or near-peer adversary profile in accordance with existing testing requirements of the acquisition cycle. Where applicable, these evaluations will include tabletop exercises, lab assessments, and exercise/operational assessments of Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and ground weapon systems. Cyber hardening efforts will apply knowledge from weapon systems vulnerability assessments to identify gaps and develop mitigation strategies to reduce operational risk and prioritize resources. Prioritization will be based on mission criticality, impact to readiness, and threat. This PE also provides for enhancement of existing Red Team elements and efforts attributed to Combatant Command mission-level cyber vulnerability assessments.

Evaluations of cyber vulnerabilities at critical infrastructure will focus on Task Critical Assets, Defense Critical Assets, and on units with high priority Quadrennial Defense Review missions and their supporting infrastructure. This PE provides for the training of teams to conduct cyber vulnerability evaluations on critical infrastructure. Once trained, these teams will conduct cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (Blue Teaming), adversarial assessments (Red Teaming), and assist with conducting assessments of cyber dependencies, vulnerabilities and threats in accordance with DoDI 8501.1 "Risk Management Framework." Funding will also provide for Contractor subject matter expertise to conduct Security Control Assessments and Deep Cyber Resiliency Assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds cyber vulnerabilities evaluations of major weapon systems in alignment with Section 1647 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016, and of critical infrastructure in alignment with Section 1650 of NDAA 2017. Efforts in this PE will: 1) identify, assess, and mitigate operational risk from cyber vulnerabilities as it pertains to critical Army weapon systems in an operational configuration; and 2) assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the information and control systems that underpin Army facilities and critical infrastructure by inventorying and assessing Facility-Related Control Systems (FRCS).

Weapon systems evaluations will assess and mitigate operational risk from a peer or near-peer adversary profile in accordance with existing testing requirements of the acquisition cycle. Where applicable, these evaluations will include tabletop exercises, lab assessments, and exercise/operational assessments of Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) and ground weapon systems. Cyber hardening efforts will apply knowledge from weapon systems vulnerability assessments to identify gaps and develop mitigation strategies to reduce operational risk and prioritize resources. Prioritization will be based on mission criticality, impact to readiness, and threat. This PE also provides for enhancement of existing Red Team elements and efforts attributed to Combatant Command mission-level cyber vulnerability assessments.

Evaluations of cyber vulnerabilities at critical infrastructure will focus on Task Critical Assets, Defense Critical Assets, and on units with high priority Quadrennial Defense Review missions and their supporting infrastructure. First, this PE provides for the training of teams to conduct cyber vulnerability evaluations on critical infrastructure. Once trained, these teams will conduct cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments (Blue Teaming), adversarial assessments (Red Teaming), and assist with conducting assessments of cyber dependencies, vulnerabilities and threats in accordance with DoDI 8501.1 "Risk Management Framework." Funding will also provide for Contractor subject matter expertise to conduct Security Control Assessments and Deep Cyber Resiliency Assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

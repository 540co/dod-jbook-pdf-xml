            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Development Agency (SDA) is established to develop the next generation space architecture to enable U.S. military operations to be responsive to emerging multi-domain threats against our national security. To achieve that goal, the SDA will help inform the Department's decision to develop and implement a proliferated architecture enabled by lower cost, commercially-derived spacecraft and routine space access, shift the Department to a development organization focused on experimentation, prototyping, and accelerated fielding, and change the Department to a concentrated, decoupled structure to generate speed. The SDA will manage, direct, and execute the development of the space capabilities in accordance with DoD’s Space Vision and field space capabilities at speed and scale, with the following goals:
• bold breakthroughs designed to obsolesce our competitors,
• technology maturation and systems engineering,
• lean engineering, manufacturing, and support,
• industrial base expansion; streamlined development and acquisition process, and
• increased acquisition cooperation with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

The SDA will rapidly deploy critical elements of the next-generation space capabilities, initially focusing on these essential capabilities:
• Persistent global surveillance for advanced missile targeting,
• Indications, warnings, targeting, and tracking for defense against advanced missile threats,
• Alternate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) for a GPS-denied environment,
• Global and near-real time space situational awareness,
• Development of a deterrent capability,
• Responsive, resilient, common ground-based space support infrastructure (e.g., ground stations and launch capability),
• Cross-domain, networked, node-independent battle management command, control, and communications (BMC3), including nuclear command, control, and
communications (NC3), and, 
• Highly-scaled, low-latency, persistent, artificial intelligence-enable global surveillance.

The establishment of a communications and data transport layer in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is essential to developing a new, responsive space architecture, and will be SDA’s primary initial focus. The SDA will heavily leverage DARPA’s Blackjack program (PE 0603287E) and its plan to demonstrate a 20-satellite constellation to build this transport layer. The SDA will develop an initial wedge of sub-constellations on this transport layer to provide additional capabilities, such as advanced missile warning.

This program element funds efforts to develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations in support of the DoD Space Vision.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Technology Development and Prototyping effort will develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations to provide the eight capabilities outlined in the DoD Space Vision.  The SDA will rapidly develop and field the next generation space architecture that will enable the US to deploy space capabilities that out-pace adversarial threats.  This architecture is underpinned by a communications and data transport layer, which will reside on a proliferated small satellite constellation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  The Transport Layer will support the transfer of data between the space segment of the next generation space architecture, to potentially include
payloads co-hosted with the Transport Layer or other non-collocated space elements, and the ground, to include ground support infrastructure and very large numbers of users/subscribers.  The Transport Layer will provide the "connective tissue" for the next generation space architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develop and demonstrate a prototype a resilient and unified military communications and data transport layer, enabled by a proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) architecture. This effort will demonstrate capability to provide very low latency (low or high bandwidth) communications and data between any two points on the globe to enable mission-agnostic battle management, command, control, and communications (BMC3). This effort will leverage technologies developed under the DARPA Blackjack program and, wherever feasible, leverage commercial industry plans to provide broadband internet access from space to form the foundation of the transport layer architecture.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Technology Development and Prototyping effort will develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations to provide the eight capabilities outlined in the DoD Space Vision. Developing and fielding a pLEO space architecture will significantly improve U.S. resilience posture in space. The Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Launch project will further support this vision of enhanced resilience.  Global and near real-time SSA will provide a detailed understanding of the space order of battle and a responsive launch capability to enable rapid constitution or replenishment of space capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Working with commercial providers, develop and demonstrate enhanced space situational awareness (SSA) and small-to-medium launch service access to provide SSA on large numbers of small satellites in LEO, including tracking, orbit determination, orbital state and uncertainty propagation, conjunction prediction, and collision avoidance. This effort will leverage existing Government and commercial tools and approaches to extend capabilities for a pLEO environment. In addition, this effort will identify and contract for launch of small-to-medium size payloads, to demonstrate responsive constitution and replenishment.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The pLEO Missile Warning (MW) Ground Integration project will enable a persistent global surveillance capability, enabled by a pLEO data communications transport layer, that will provide indications, warnings, targeting, and tracking to support the defeat of advanced missile threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>pLEO Missile Warning Ground Integration</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Develop and demonstrate a prototype MW ground infrastructure compatible with a proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) sensor infrastructure.  This effort will focus on integrating MW technologies and on-orbit residual capability in the form of sensors, command and control software, and data products demonstrated by DARPA's Blackjack program, and any follow-on MW prototyping efforts, into a MW ground support infrastructure. To the maximum extent possible, this effort will leverage commercial approaches for pLEO constellation management while maximizing support for the legacy MW ground segment.  The development will be a phased approach to transition current command and control to a new, consolidated Battle Management, Command, Control, and Communications (BMC3) infrastructure consistent with the DoD Space Vision.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The FY2019 NDAA amends the Chairman’s responsibilities to address experimentation on future concepts and the 2018 National Defense Strategy Implementation Guidance directs that rigorous experimentation take place on concepts to ensure Department investments adequately address future requirements as well as those of today. Accordingly, the Joint Staff requires an experimentation capability to analyze and validate priority joint concept required capabilities. 

Concept analysis and validation will have a multi-faceted nature to meet the Chairmen’s Title 10 responsibility of, “identifying new joint military capabilities based on advances in technology and concepts of operation, and recommending investments and experiments in such capabilities.” Wargames will assess baseline mission and campaign level outcomes of the concepts as well as identify a tradespace of potential new capabilities. This tradespace of capabilities is further explored with quantitative models and software that identify the most efficient cost and capability tradeoffs to help meet the Title 10 responsibility of “advising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.” 

The National Defense Strategy directs “early design tradeoffs in the requirements process to increase the speed of delivery.” The Joint Staff approach to tradespace exploration follows that guidance by providing a cost conscious and operationally relevant prioritization tradeoff technique early in the portfolio design process. Using this rigorous prioritization approach, the capability development cycle can efficiently focus resources on more detailed experimentation of specific capabilities to inform the requirements process. The analysis from the experimentation program will be used to provide foundational evidence to directly inform the Joint Military Net Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman’s Program Recommendation (CPR), and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The 2018 National Defense Strategy Implementation Guidance directed rigorous experimentation on concepts as a means to ensure Department investments adequately address future requirements, not just near term. Given this, the Joint Staff must establish an experimentation capability suitable for analysis and validation of priority joint concept required capabilities. The base of experimentation and wargaming will expand through the initial operating capability to full operating capability.  This will provide the necessary capacity and capability.  The combination will allow the Chairman to identify cost efficient and effective capability tradeoffs. This capability will enable the Chairman to fulfill his Title 10 responsibility, “advising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.” This capability more fully supports the Chairman’s production of the Joint Military Needs Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman’s Program Recommendation (CPR) and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>(DWR) $11.2M funding results from the Secretary of Defense’s Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reform effort as part of a realignment of resources to higher priorities within the Department.  This synergized and synchronized way forward accelerates the integration of new concepts and capabilities into the Joint Force by developing a continuously adapting Joint Force Development and Design (JFDD) enterprise that can inform Service force development and design efforts.  To facilitate this initiative requires several lines of effort (LOE): 

1) Developing and executing Globally Integrated Exercises (GIE);
 
2) Developing and executing a new series of Globally Integrated Wargames (GIWGs) and the associated development of concepts;

3) Developing and deploying the IT architecture to collect and share data and information (i.e. exercises, experimentation, wargaming, analysis) that supports JFDD including GIE, GIWG, and Joint Warfighting Concepts;

4) Conducting JFDD Enterprise Integration and Testing to inform key decisions and evaluate GIWGs and other JFDD activities including in the near-term JADC2, Contested Logistics, Global Fires, and Information Advantage; and

5) Employing red teaming at all levels, implementing reforms to Professional Military Education (PME) for JFDD and incorporating emerging concepts into Joint Doctrine.

Funding allows for alignment and coordination of disparate activities across the Department and establishes a capability for joint experimentation and wargaming focused on JFDD that will enhance the capability of the Joint Staff to provide the Chairman with sound analysis of the future environment, concepts, and joint capabilities.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>Nimble Fire is the Department’s only IAMD operator-in-the-loop modeling and simulation capability supporting the Chairman's top five critical joint IAMD capabilities: wide-area surveillance and engagement quality tracking, pre-launch interdiction, non-kinetic post-launch capabilities, ballistic missile discrimination, and increased weapons ranges and lethality.  Nimble Fire events generally explore joint IAMD capabilities and concepts in the FYDP plus two timeframe. The events combine experienced operators from the tactical communities, virtual simulations accredited by the program offices, current and future advanced capabilities, an integrated air, ballistic and cruise missile threat, and informed scenarios based on the Department’s analytical agenda and CCMD operational plans.  JIAMDO brings together stakeholders across the engineering, analytical, and tactical communities to assess Joint interoperability of Service and MDA programs of record, explore concepts of employment, inform tactics, techniques and procedures and concepts of operation, provide insights that help shape CCMD integrated priorities and future operational plans, and inform senior leader acquisition and requirements decisions.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) program supports the Chairman’s Title 10 responsibility for the analytical support, management and development of future-based joint concepts. These concepts include concepts of operations and employment that advance Joint Force operational effectiveness and enable the introduction and incorporation of new capabilities. The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's responsibility to express a vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20-year horizon; identifying joint force development and design implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The goal is to enable investment decisions balancing near and long term risk. Threat-informed joint concepts drive capability development and promote horizontal integration for force development and design across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. Key deliverables include:  

Family of Joint Concepts (FOJC): Based on the National Military Strategy (NMS) and providing operational and joint functional approaches to future adversary based challenges or opportunities. These concepts prioritize Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations (hereafter referred to as the 2+3).  The FOJC drives capability development and alternative approaches to operating in support of a globally integrated force benchmarked against current and long-term pacing threats.  The FOJC includes the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, Joint Warfighting Concept, Joint Operating Concepts for the 2+3 challenges, Joint Supporting Concepts that address joint warfighting functions, Concepts of Operation and Concepts of Employment.

Capstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO): Provides the Chairman's vision for future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations and directs joint concept driven, threat-informed capability to regain competitive advantage.

Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC): Identifies innovative and alternative approaches and design options for the employment of the Joint Force out to 2030.  

Joint Operating Concepts: Describe new ways of operating and associated capability requirements to address the 2+3 threat out fifteen years into the future.  

Concepts of Operations (CONOPS): Describe how the actions of the joint force components and supporting organizations are integrated, synchronized, and phased to accomplish a specific mission or function within the construct of a future scenario.  CONOPS support evaluation of new ways of operating, future force posture mix, advanced capabilities, and authorities in exercises, wargames, and experiments.
	
Concepts of Employment (CONEMPS): Describe, in broad terms, the application of specific technology, process, weapon system, or unit to perform a particular task or procedure.  They are the most specific of all military concepts and contain a level of guidance sufficient to inform the establishment of programmatic requirements. CONEMPS’ focus on the cross-domain employment of capabilities and techniques in areas like space, cyberspace, and the electro-magnetic spectrum (EMS) to enable joint information advantage.

Joint Operating Environment (JOE) and the Gamechangers report: Developed in partnership with DIA, this report describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force. The documents describe the circumstances that may alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. They provide a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time in order to support development of threat-based future Joint concepts and concepts of operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Force Management (GFM) data initiative Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) effort provides the next steps for GFM mission application enhancements required to balance global force demand against available military force. This complex task requires technologies that provide integrated information obtained by linking force structure quantitative data (derived from the GFM organizational servers) to qualitative data of Capability, Readiness, Availability and Employment/Location data (C.R.A.E.) resident in GFM mission applications and associated data bases. The Joint Staff is responsible for GFM allocation and will employ a strategy for efficiently providing Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.

DoD must meet national military objectives that range from large force scenarios to small-scale activities. Our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic effects. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that rapidly and accurately enables force sourcing activities to support SecDef decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service’s organizational server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the health and worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by numerous Joint Staff requirements documents.

The Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) enterprise force structure data integration efforts enables Project ORION: a Global Laydown Server and a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog along with functional applications that support a global visibility capability. This capability enhances resource-informed planning, global force management and joint deployment. Global visibility capability also supports future force integration and concept implementation needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders’ contingency requirements. Project ORION creates a technical environment that enables rapid integration of the JOPES replacement with remaining GFM data that supports planning and execution of U.S. Military Operations. Project Orion provides operational force structure and the means to allocate and attach units. This capability is the cornerstone for fulfilling the CJCS-directed requirement to integrate force planning, support planning, and deployment planning and execution of military operations. The ORION environment supports all variants of planning and execution processes by providing portal access to authoritative data aggregated in the Global Laydown Servers and associated display of force capabilities, readiness, employment, and availability of the force. This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The GFM DI EFS integration effort requires RDT&amp;E funds to operationalize force structure data from the service's Organizational Servers to actual forces for employment within the purview of allocation and Joint command and control. This GFM DI effort within the Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) family of programs will immediately streamline the SECDEFs "Forces for Unified Commands" memorandum Assignment Tables. RDT&amp;E efforts for assignment and apportionment functions ended in FY 2015 with the declaration of Full Operation Capability (FOC) for the Automated Global Force Management Tool. GFM DI planned milestones must be met to enable a global visibility capability. GFM applications managed by the Joint Staff are used by the JSAS family of programs.</r2:Description>

- Air Force Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Navy Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Joint Interoperability Division (JID)

- Marine Corps Joint National Training Capability (JNTC)

- Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)

JNTC:  The mission of the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) program is to advance joint capabilities and interoperability by concentrating on emerging joint training requirements through collective training using a managed set of globally distributed capabilities and activities. The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training to improve interoperability and create realistic tactical and operational joint training.  JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman’s guidance.

JKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development &amp; Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&amp;E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.

Air Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment as well supporting development of cross-domain solutions. Additionally, the Air Force invests in development of capabilities to enhance the rigor and fidelity of training for live and virtual members of joint training audiences.

Navy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, and integration of a common, realistic, joint and coalition, operational to tactical level training architecture to deliver individual and collective constructive joint training for use in Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events, CCDR exercises, Ballistic Missile Defense Exercises (BMDEX) certification events, and BMD at Sea training events in support of CCDR’s training, deployment certification and operational requirements.

JID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.

Marine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations.  In support of the Commandant’s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. 

ADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, Combat Support Agencies, Interagency, and multinational partners) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members on tasks that are jointly executed.  JKO’s research and development will improve all components of the Joint Content Management Architecture (JCMA) including:  

1. JKO Learning Management System (LMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. There are currently over 3.6 million registered users of the JKO LMS.

2. JKO Course Builder: JKO’s Course Builder is a separate component used as a force multiplier for organizations to develop online content by both internal and external joint enterprise teams. Course Builder mitigates the need to have programmer’s code Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) standards into content with automation that promotes fiscal efficiency as well as operational responsiveness. Course Builder will also support the new development methodology of micro-learning.    

3.  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses significantly enhance blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises.

4.  JKO Virtual Classroom (VClass):  JKO’s new virtual classroom, or VClass, meets the need for an enhanced distributed learning capability with the introduction of a collaborative learning environment.  VClass is a customizable platform within JKO's architecture and will provide JKO elevated users the tools to meet the unique needs of DoD’s training and education audience by providing online/blended course support with syllabus, messaging, gradebook, resources, announcements and synchronous instructional forums.

5. JKO mobile training development:  Development and enhancements in JKO’s new approach to Responsive Design will significantly increase availability and access of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (e.g. cell phones and tablets).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) advance technology initiatives primarily include the JKO Learning Management System (LMS) application, Course Builder, Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training capability, Virtual Classroom, and mobile courseware training applications.  These capabilities increase access to, and facilitate the training and preparation of hundreds of thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command (CCMD) theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Joint and Combined/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) billets.  JKO LMS development and enhancements are required to develop, host, deliver, track, report and support students’ completions, progress and survey results more effectively and efficiently.  C/JTF “battle staffs” and combatant command (CCMD) personnel will be better trained, as individuals and as staffs, based on SGST, VClass development, and implementation throughout the joint training enterprise.  JKO mobile courseware training development via Responsive Design facilitates the global distribution of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms for DoD personnel.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>1. Develop, test, and deliver two JKO Learning Content Management System (LCMS) releases resulting in improved cybersecurity, and a more effective and efficient online training management application that is interoperable with DoD personnel management systems.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve access and ease of use for the projected ~50,000 daily log-ins and ~560,000 monthly course completions by DoD personnel.  

2. Develop, test, and deliver four JKO Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation application releases resulting in a more effective and efficient training capability integrated within the JKO LCMS.  JKO anticipates these enhancements will improve the quality of the training experience for Combatant Command and Service exercise participants resulting in heightened preparedness for real world operations. Individual training proficiency improvement will be measured and quantified as part of the exercise design.  

3. JKO will assess, refine, and continue executing a comprehensive plan to enhance the JKO mobile capability and mobile training products via Responsive Design. JKO’s planned components include courseware and video conversions to portable hand-held devices while leveraging other DoD agencies, interagency, and multinational training courseware ported to the JKO. JKO anticipates the development and conversion of ~200 training courses, eBooks, Podcasts, job aids, and videos resulting in reduced cost for classroom training and thousands of hours delivered onsite and on demand to DoD personnel mobile platforms worldwide.</r2:Text>

Research, develop, test, and evaluate a virtual classroom (VClass) open source capability (Sakai) to be integrated into the JKO LMS suite of tools for synchronous (live) and non-synchronous (video-taped) instructor led training as well as a micro learning technology (Pervasive Learning System (PERLS)), in conjunction with ADL, for content development and delivery on both the mobile and LMS platforms. JKO’s new VClass capability will provide required enhanced distributed learning (DL) much like today’s universities with an expectation of student-to-instructor collaboration; student-to-student collaboration; written assignment evaluation; live instructor response and teaching; and critical thinking exercises and assignments.  PERLS delivers self-regulated micro-learning training that is designed to be engaging, usable and practical, allowing individuals to quickly access desired learning content whenever an opportunity arises. As DoD organizations increase training via DL opportunities to mitigate expenses due to decreased funding and personnel, the methodologies of developing and delivering DL must be cutting edge, timely and optimize the learning experience of the joint warfighter.  PERLS and micro-learning provide that edge and optimization.</r2:Text>

These systems are tailored to prepare operational Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for worldwide deployment in support of CCMD operations and engagements and are available to any organization or entity training via the JLVC federation of training tools.  Based on the Commandant's planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-multi-resolution federation bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  The MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also provides a single source training environment capability that enables users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems easing the burden of requesting terrain, 3D models, and other geographic layers into a single source. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also enhances pattern of life (PoL) / indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers the ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into the training scenarios.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Capability capitalizes on personnel learning experience outside of formal training/education settings. Support software development integration of PERLS in JKO LCMS and Mobile tools.

3. Learner-Centric, Total Learning Architecture (TLA). Develop next-generation interoperability specifications that will form the backbone for the “learner-centric, next-generation, technology-enabled” future joint learning environment, in direct support of Joint Force Development goals. FY 2020 TRL = 6

4. Support enhancements to multinational training by continuing collaboration with coalition partners and gaining support to integrate e-learning into multination exercises.</r2:Text>

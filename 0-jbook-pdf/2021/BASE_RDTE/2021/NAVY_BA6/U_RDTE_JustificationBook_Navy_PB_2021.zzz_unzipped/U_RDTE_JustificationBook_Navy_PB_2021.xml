                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of this project is development of necessary simulation facilities and approaches to allow determination of the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare (EW) in real world engagement situations and to support the introduction of modern, effective systems into Naval Aviation. The heavy use of test resources by all Services demonstrates the importance of these assets. 

The Electronic Warfare Environment Simulation project is unique because it is the only program within the Department of Defense which develops and provides Naval anti-air warfare threat assets for Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E).

This project directly supports the T&amp;E resource requirements for all Naval Air EW development programs, to include multi-spectral situational awareness and countermeasures. Programs in development and future programs include: Joint Strike Fighter, EA-18G, Low Band Transmitter, Next Generation Jammer, Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and Triton.

This project provides for the development of an Integrated Air Defense T&amp;E capability to be fielded at each of the three sites comprising the Navy's Tri-Center complex: Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake and Point Mugu in CA, and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Effectiveness of  Navy Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems (ENEWS) Project is the development and application of necessary simulation assets to determine the effectiveness of Electronic Warfare for Navy ships in simulated real-world engagement situations. The project primarily supports the introduction of modern, effective shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems, and tactics for the Surface Navy. The heavy use of ENEWS resources by Naval Sea Systems Command, Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) Force, Special Operations, and other Electronic Warfare Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) agencies speaks to the overall importance of this project. The project provides support for Electronic Warfare system design, Engineering Test (ET), Development Test (DT), Operational Test (OT), and the development of utilization tactics. In the past ENEWS quick reaction capabilities have had great impact on crisis situations such as the Libyan crises, Iran threat, Persian Gulf crisis, and Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Simulation Display (SIMDIS) is an ENEWS modeling tool that was developed to support Testing and Evaluation. Simulation Display has been adopted by most Department of Defense (DoD) Testing and Evaluation and training ranges to provide visualization of Testing and Evaluation and training scenarios. One of the primary threats to surface ships is Anti-Ship Capable Missile systems. The Effectiveness of ENEWS Project is unique in that it is the only project within the Department of Defense dedicated to developing and providing realistic Anti-Ship Capable Missile assets to test and evaluate the effectiveness of shipboard Electronic Warfare systems and tactics against these type threats. The  ENEWS Project is a critical part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Master Plan. This plan employs many of the  ENEWS assets for planning, analysis, testing, and verification of shipboard and off-board Electronic Warfare systems techniques and tactics. As part of its normal activities, ENEWS provides Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E), and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) support to the surface Navy for all ship classes. Development Test, Operational Test and Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation support includes AN/SLQ-32 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), Nulka, Rapid Anti-ship Integrated Defense System, all MK245 Giant tests, advanced InfraRed (IR) decoys, decoy placement, ship InfraRed signature and radar cross section measurement of DDG-51, LPD-17, DD-21 and Patrol Craft class ships, High Power Microwave program, and other ship self-defense initiatives, including Test and Evaluation of Future Naval Capability process. In addition, ENEWS assets are regularly employed to test the effectiveness of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ships' Electronic Warfare systems in joint allied exercises. ENEWS assets also support Joint Electronic Warfare exercises that are conducted with Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) nations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Aerial Target Systems Development program is the design and development of threat representative subsonic and supersonic aerial targets that simulate threat weapon systems, threat aircraft or threat Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition to representative air vehicles, this includes development of Target Control (TC) systems, and associated Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) which are used to replicate specific threats.  Targets and auxiliary payloads are developed to support test and evaluation of combat systems required to defend fleet surface and air units in a hostile environment.  As to specific hardware development, this project includes:

 - Supersonic Targets: Portfolio includes GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST), GQM-173A Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST), and AQM-37 programs. Supersonic targets represent supersonic anti-ship cruise missile threats. The design and development of GQM-163A capabilities provide threat representative targets that are used in direct support of Developmental Test and Evaluation, Operational Test and Evaluation, and Live Fire Test and Evaluation of major combat weapons programs and to a lesser degree, support fleet training. Critical live-fire Test and Evaluation events are supported for AEGIS, DDG-1000, LHA-6, CVN-78, LCS, and LSD-41/49 (SM-6, SM-2, RAM, SSDS, and ESSM). The GQM-163A is a non-recoverable supersonic sea skimming aerial target, capable of speeds in excess of Mach 2.5 and cruise altitudes from 13.0 to 66 ft. The GQM-163A has also demonstrated  higher altitude diving threat profiles. MSST was a supersonic development effort that was terminated on September 25, 2015. Once the contract termination costs have been determined by DCMA, funds may be required to cover settlement costs. However, the requirement still exists to provide a multi-stage vehicle presentation. New supersonic target development efforts include a replacement target for AQM-37.

 - Subsonic Targets: Portfolio includes BQM-177A, and BQM-34 &amp; BQM-74 subsonic target programs. The BQM-177A SSAT development primarily represents subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats, replacing legacy BQM-74E targets with a modernized subsonic target with increased capabilities.  The BQM-177A SSAT provides threat representation for developmental and operational test &amp; evaluation events of major combat weapons systems programs and in support of fleet training events.  Specifically, the BQM-177A SSAT provides critical live-fire test and evaluation events for AEGIS, SM-6, SM-2, RAM, and ESSM.  BQM-34s are undergoing product improvement program efforts to increase their current performance envelope to meet evolving Fleet training requirements and weapon system test events.   

 - Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), and Target Control and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TC/TA/AS) development: the TTSP portfolio provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial targets to provide threat representative radio frequency signatures, specifically the electronic attack and threat radar emissions (active emitters). Development of threat representative simulation components is on-going and required to keep pace with evolving threats and ensure that the Navy's threat simulation capabilities maintain warfighter readiness in the current environment. TC provides command and control of targets to enable the execution of threat-representative mission profiles.  The mission also includes the design, development and qualification of various TMSS projects including but not limited to: Target RF datalink hardware, ground control hardware and software, scorer transponders, scoring ground stations, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification, friend or foe transponders, and associated test sets. TA/AS enables each target to be uniquely configured for specific mission profiles and provide for high fidelity simulation of foreign threats. TA/AS-configured targets are used for radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement and testing, radar cross section evaluation, decoy-effectiveness testing, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare evaluation, warhead-effectiveness testing and evaluation of fleet tactics. TA/AS scoring capabilities include both surface and airborne scalar scoring systems. 

In addition to the design and development of target hardware and software, funding supports studies performed by a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) to specify and verify needed target performance for future target development.  For the design and validation of targets under development, the UARC will provide engineering studies in areas such as structures, controls, guidance, and propulsion.  For those hardware and software items presently under development by commercial vendors, the UARC will provide oversight and validation of vendor design and development approach.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP) provides the payload equipment required to electronically enhance aerial/surface targets to provide threat representative Radio Frequency signatures, specifically the Electronic Attack and Threat Radar Emissions (Active Emitters).  The TTSP accomplishes this by providing a collection of modules which are integrated into individual targets in various configurations to provide the ability to simulate the RF environment.  TTSP equipment in various configurations is certified for carriage in aerial/surface targets. Funding supports the continued development of the TTSP portfolio so that the Navy can keep pace with emerging enemy threats.  Funding is provided for the development of Target Control (TC) systems and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems (TA/AS) capable of supporting Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and fleet training activities to ensure emerging threat simulation requirements are met.  Target Control Systems (TCS) involve the improved command and control systems capable of controlling multiple targets simultaneously while delivering adequate fidelity of T&amp;E telemetry data.  The TMSS program portfolio provides target control, scoring, location, and navigation of air, land and seaborne targets for fleet training and weapons systems test and evaluation.  Funding also supports the design, development and qualification of TMSS including but not limited to the current and next generation TC systems, scalar scorers, scoring ground station, telemetry antennas, radar and locator beacons, identification friend or foe and associated test sets.  Augmentation and auxiliary systems must be capable of augmenting targets in support of radar acquisition test, electronic countermeasures (jamming) evaluation, infrared measurement/test, radar cross section evaluation, decoy effectiveness, maneuver analysis, electronic warfare, warhead effectiveness and evaluation of fleet tactics, readiness, and training.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Supersonics: The GQM-163A Supersonic Sea-Skimming Target (SSST) is an Acquisition Category II program. The acquisition  strategy includes the continued development of Quad Launch, design efforts for integration of new Radome and Radar Altimeter, Electronic Warfare (EW) systems and other Engineering Change Proposals as required to emulate emerging threat systems. These development efforts will continue to be rolled into the production baseline. Production efforts are expected to continue at higher quantities in order to meet projected MDAP T&amp;E requirements. Additionally, development of alternative supersonic targets is being explored. 

Congress was notified on September 25, 2015 that the Department of the Navy made the decision to terminate the Multi-Stage Supersonic Target (MSST) development program. Termination settlement efforts are ongoing with DCMA.

Subsonics: The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) program is an ACAT-IV program. The Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 contract was awarded in 3rd Quarter of FY19 with Full Rate Production (FRP) Contracts to follow. Engineering Change Proposals will be contracted as required via IDIQ contract vehicles to keep pace with emerging threat systems and changes rolled into the production baseline. Development efforts for other subsonic targets will be resourced via other contracting efforts as required.

Target Threat Simulation Program (TTSP), Target Mission Support Systems (TMSS), Target Control, and Target Augmentation and Auxiliary Systems: The acquisition strategy for these components vary, depending on industry responses to government issued Requests for Information, but most are acquired via Firm Fixed Price IDIQ contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This effort supports the transition of the Sprint Speed and Low Frequency Improvement Phase 2.5 efforts into MK 39 Mod 3 EMATT production and starts to investigate Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) capability to provide better detection performance and provide operators with a continuous track. Sprint Speed and Frequency Expansion upgrade allows EMATT to more closely represent submarine tactics for evasion and will make it compatible with new ASW sensors like the LCS ASW mission package.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Planning System (MIPS) is an automated air and missile defense planning tool that supports the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander at the Operational Level of War (OLW) by automatically and optimally allocating and stationing ships in support of Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW). MIPS contains United States Army Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) models to ensure synergistic allocation and positioning of maritime units in relation to other joint units, providing optimized mutual defense for selected defended assets against selected BMD and AAW threats.  MIPS completed developing significantly improved inorganic Ballistic Missile Defense planning capabilities through the incorporation of Long Range Surveillance and Training, Cued Engagement, and Launch on Tactical Digital Information Links (TADIL) planning functionality.  In FY2015, MIPS began development to deliver an automated planning capability for Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) operations, incorporating the Naval Positioning Assessment Tool (NPAT) to assist in aviation asset placement, bottom contours will be added to refine the areas of ship positioning during the planning process, and adding the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) stationing planning capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports detailed mission, capability, and technical analysis of future naval warfighting requirements.  This work provides the analytical basis for integration and prioritization of overall military capability requirements and acquisition programs in support of executing the Naval Capability Development Process and development/delivery of Mission Capability Packages, Naval Capability Packages, and Integrated Strategic Capability Plans for Chief of Naval Operations. The Resource Allocation Model (RAM) is an analytic decision support tool to aid Navy leadership with both investment and divestment programming decisions. This methodology provides an assessment process that fosters informed, understandable, repeatable investment decisions with consistent, pedigreed, and retrievable information. The focus of this work adds fidelity to the system through the inclusion of Mission Technical Baselines and Integrated Capabilities Technical Baselines data to identify program of record integration and interoperability dependencies to inform investment/divestment decisions. It provides leadership and resource sponsors with a starting point for their offset decision process as well as an issue ranking capability. RAM will include linkage of programs to strategic imperatives, programs mapped to warfare areas, program interdependencies annotated, and balance factors that can be adjusted to reflect Navy Leadership Priorities. This effort captures and maps issues/funding adjustments, and providing a system capable of identifying fiscal interdependencies and consideration to risk in order to increase accuracy in calculating programmatic risk.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Naval aviation pre-Milestone B developmental activities to include the conduct and integration of systems engineering activities. This project unit provides information, automated tools, and decision aids necessary to perform acquisition planning in support of warfighter capability requirements. This project unit also supports research, development, and analysis efforts to include various studies, joint requirements analysis, and cost analysis in support of systems engineering activities, analyses of alternatives, and development of Capability Evolution Plan. Due to high turnover and end of service life of several Naval aircraft set against increasing threat capabilities, DOD 5000 series mandates documentation of capability requirements and mechanisms to obtain these capabilities. This project unit allows Naval aviation the means to properly identify capability gaps and potential solutions required to maintain maximum warfighting capability realizing (or achieving) reductions to technical risks and overall program costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of the Navy's (DON) Studies and Analysis Federally Funded Research and Development Center (DON S&amp;A FFRDC - hereinafter referred to as the FFRDC) provides independent, objective, and expert analyses based on its unique access to sensitive data and hands-on exposure to fleet operations gained through a world-wide field program. The FFRDC'sresearch program is centrally funded by this program element and is primarily concentrated along one Marine Corps category and thirteen Navy categories of study called product areas. These product areas are structured to enhance the FFRDC's focus of research and analysis upon the major present and future needs and issues of the Navy and the Marine Corps. Because of rapid advances in technology, changes in the fleet, the increasing complexity of weapon systems, and reductions in manpower, force structure, budgets, the current security environment, and Department of Defense (DOD) transformation, the Navy and Marine Corps have a greater need for analyses that are sophisticated, relevant, and timely. The FFRDC conducts research and analysis at all security classification levels, to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP). 

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program requires each Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 3.2% for SBIR.  This funds R&amp;D at small businesses.  The program goals are to stimulate technological innovation; increase small business participation in federally funded R&amp;D; foster participation by minority and disadvantaged firms in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of federal R&amp;D.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program requires Federal agency that has an extramural budget for Research and Development (R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 to set aside 0.45% for STTR.  This funds cooperative R&amp;D between small businesses and research institutions.  The program goals are to create vehicles from moving ideas from research institutions to market; enable researchers to pursue commercial application of technologies; and bridge funding gap between basic research and commercial product.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of the Navy (DON) often funds research and new technologies that have commercial application and payoff. To facilitate the "tactical to practical" transition, the DON Technology Transfer (T2) Program Office produces policy and guidance, products and services to help make Navy-developed technologies available for public use, as appropriate. There are a number of ways in which the actual transfer may take place,. Technology Transfer Offices to enhance U.S. naval forces effectiveness by strategically leveraging industrial and academic research and development partnerships for modernization. These partnerships transition private sector technology into the NRE, and transfer appropriate Navy-developed innovative concepts, inventions, facilities and materiel to the private sector for the purposes of dual-use commercialization, to benefit DoD, the public economy, and academia. (Public Law 96-480, Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.) This program also provides the Department of the Navy interface to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology Policy for matters relating to policy and reporting requirements for technology transfer.

Due to the number of efforts in this PE, the programs described herein are representative of the work included in this PE.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>To enhance transactional efficiency between the Navy laboratories and industry and academic collaborators, the Navy Technology Transfer (T2) Office will revise and update Technology Transfer mechanisms (e.g., Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), PIAs templates, Navy Defense Technology Transfer Information System (NDTTIS) database, online training), Technology Transfer Handbook, Licensing Handbook and Policy Guidance. It will also execute at least two new pilot programs to embolden innovative T2 efforts at Navy Office of Research and Technology Application (ORTA) activities across laboratories and commercialize Navy laboratory-developed technologies. Additionally, the T2 Program Office will raise the visibility of Navy technologies through publications, videos, website/social media, marketing and outreach to capitalize on the Navy laboratory developed innovations and systematically drive economic growth in the industrial base, create new services and products and amplify an inclusive technology based economic development.

In order to deliver solutions and capabilities to the acquisition workforce in support of the warfighter, the Navy T2 Program Office will enhance the NDTTIS database to leverage the value/impact of CRADAs. The Navy-wide T2 Innovation Discovery/Intellectual Property Mining Program will be expanded to identify, license and transition more patentable inventions that provide solutions to acquisition and commercial industry technological challenges that can benefit the warfighter and society. The Program Office will also lead and participate in national and regional technology transfer industry and academia engagement events to optimize the marketing and outreach of Navy developed inventions and expand on collaboration opportunities with industry and engage with underserved communities and non-traditional partners to advance commercialization.

The Navy T2 Program Office will institute a customer relationship and transaction management system that harmonizes and streamlines the T2 mechanism collaboration process, consolidates the Navy's intellection capital into a single structure through a centrally managed portfolio that will include a marketing analysis component, provide for external and internal stakeholder engagement, licensing and ecosystem landscape analysis to discover and forge opportunities for mutually beneficial T2 commercialization collaborations with academia, economic development agencies and start-up businesses.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>International Cooperative RDT&amp;E: provide program management, execution, and support to implement a broad range of cooperative Naval Research and Development, Test and Evaluation initiatives to improve coalition interoperability, harmonize US Navy requirements with allied and friendly nations, and identify cooperative international opportunities, and improve coalition interoperability.  In addition, it develops coherent approaches, coordinating with partner nations, to sea-based missile defense, command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I), and cooperative acquisition programs while also identifying technology to support the Global Maritime Partnership initiative.

Naval War College Strategic Studies Support:  

Provides research, analysis and gaming activities which serve as a focal point, stimulus, and major source of strategic and operational thought within the Navy, joint and interagency communities.  These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, quantitative analysis, war gaming and political military assessments, and provide recommendations regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options .  The War Gaming Department plans, designs, executes, analyzes and reports on the Navy's Title 10 war games.  These war games provide analytical input to the Navy's Strategic Plan, assessments of future concepts, and recommendations to the Navy's Quadrennial Defense Review, force design, and strategy process.  The War Gaming Department also designs, executes and analyzes war games for theater security cooperation plans and operational war fighting issues.  

Assessment Program: 

The Navy Assessment Program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect war fighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps, and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program supports both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare and provides business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems (Information Dominance); warfare systems (Sea Strike, Sea Shield, and Sea Basing) and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports "A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower 21" as modified by the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  It serves as an independent assessor providing a broad-view perspective across the Navy staff apart from resource sponsors, with an integrated look at both war fighting and war fighting support programs.  The program supports the world class modeling efforts to attain a level of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capability that is world class and establishes the Navy as a leader in the Department of Defense (DoD) M&amp;S community.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.  It develops tools and analytical methodologies that assist in evaluating Navy programs and provides technical leadership for the analysis functional area of Naval Modeling and Simulation.


Operations Integration Group:  Classified

Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)Facilities Modernization: This program has been established to provide a systematic and planned approach to improve vital in-house science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory facilities which are reaching or have reached critical stages of deterioration.  The program includes restoration and modernization (R&amp;M) initiatives for about 350,000 net square feet, where the average age of the buildings is 67 years old.

The Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative provides the supporting IT capability framework comprised of shared information technology infrastructure, enterprise services, interoperability with coalition partners and a single security architecture that enables mission commanders to execute mission partnered operations.  JIE provides the U.S. configuration controls necessary for enterprise capabilities.  By utilizing a U.S enterprise-wide secure Identity and Access Management system, JIE ensures that authorized users at the right classification level gain access to only the data and services they are entitled.  The continued development and refinement of a Joint Information Environment will provide for a significant improvement in data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.

MTMD - Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum:

This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations through the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016).Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD)Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to
the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and
Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.

The MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. 
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.
(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&amp;D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential "dual use" technology and process solutions to complex problems.

These efforts generate strategic and operational alternatives, tactical imperatives, quantitative analyses, technical developments and assessments, and political-military assessments.  Also, provide recommendations to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Fleet Commanders and numbered Fleet Commanders regarding the formulation and execution of maritime options for the President of the United States.  Research will be conducted that will enhance graduate education for Naval Officers and potentially provide students with areas of studies for theses and faculty projects. These research activities also serve as a means for OPNAV Resource Sponsors and Major Commands to have analysis and decision support research conducted in the uses of the applied, soft, and hard sciences in solving diverse and complex resource allocation and strategic issues facing the Navy today and envisioned in the future.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This exhibit has been updated to reflect the establishment of the Navy Analytic Office (NAO), which is responsible for the executive oversight of Navy studies and analysis.  The NAO was stood up to better align the annual Analytic Agenda to CNO's strategic priorities while also providing for study of the more tactical requirements of the Fleet and Navy writ large.  The outcome will be synchronized modeling, simulation, assessments, wargames, experiments and exercises providing rich, shared data to support and refine warfighting concepts and to inform budget decisions. 
 
The Navy Annual Studies Program supports the Analytic Agenda by providing both the development and use of modeling, simulation and analytically-based warfare, business analyses and analytic tools that provide the basis for decision making with respect to concepts of operations (CONOPS), Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Systems; warfare systems, and analytical underpinnings/basis for programmatic decisions of the Navy's top leadership regarding their architectures, force structure, and the Navy's core "organize, train, and equip mission" (the warfare and provider Enterprises).  The program provides capability-based planning assessment for Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), conducts analysis to affect warfighting capability trades and enterprise resources, identifies needs, gaps and overlaps, and assesses alternative solutions to Joint needs.  The program provides overarching Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) analyses and guidance for PPBES which provides gap analysis and investment strategy and total obligation authority allocation.  It provides independent capability analysis and assists in structuring follow-on Navy analyses.  The program coordinates Navy's position for the enhanced planning process and conducts net assessments.  It serves as the lead campaign analysis to approve Navy warfare and support requirements.  The program supports the Maritime Strategy which charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent crises from occurring, or reacting quickly should one occur to avoid negative impact to the United States.  The Studies Program provides a broad-view perspective across the Fleet and Navy staff, with an integrated look at both warfighting and warfighting-support programs.  It provides Navy alternatives in assessing the implications embedded within resource decisions in a quantified context of costs versus capability versus risk.  The program provides independent analytic support to Navy leadership in conjunction with various executive level decision forums.

This project funds concept development engineering, mission effectiveness analysis, and other analyses for formulation of future surface ship and associated platform force structure along with development of the tools to accomplish these efforts. Advanced platform concept studies and systems technology assessments will be conducted as will the development and upgrade of concept design and engineering tools, methods, and criteria. Concept Formulation (CONFORM)/Concept Development and Experimentation (CDE) for ships, boats and unmanned maritime vehicles must be continuously exercised to remain viable. It takes years to train competent practitioners, and knowledge currency is quickly lost without practice. Evolving threats and technologies drive concepts (and the tools, processes, and skills needed to produce them) towards obsolescence without constant attention. Capability Based Assessments and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) timelines are insufficient for establishing potential material solution cost versus capability relationships without significant concept formulation work beforehand. Active collaboration between the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations requirement sponsors, Program Offices, and the various System Commands (Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command) engineers is critical for fully exploring the trade space by conducting analysis for affordability, effectiveness and risk.  The majority of Total Ownership Cost (TOC) is locked into a design before it is even a program. In the later stages of a program it becomes much more costly to make changes that will significantly impact TOC. Investment up front in concept design can have a high payoff in TOC reduction over the life of a platform class. Outputs include concept costing and performance parameterization for comparative assessment against capability objectives and synthesis to quantify overall (Fleet) capabilities. These products (expressions of cost vs. capability) will serve as the basis of requirements and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System analysis, define the trade space for AoA efforts, and underpin discussion of force architecture/structure during Quadrennial Defense Review, Long Range Shipbuilding Strategy builds, and Joint Requirements Oversight Council reviews.
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA) is the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) analysis process that includes three phases: Functional Area Analysis (FAA), Functional Needs Analysis (FNA), and Functional Solution Analysis (FSA). The results of the CBA are used to develop a joint capabilities document (based on the FAA and FNA) or initial capabilities document (based on the full analysis). CBA funding provides the resource sponsors the means to develop the analytic underpinning required by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01G to support the determination of Naval warfighting capabilities and force structure needed to support the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC)/JCIDS requirements validation process and to inform Program Objective Memorandum programming decisions. This analysis includes evaluation of integration and interoperability gaps of both current and future Navy platforms and systems capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds participation in Maritime Integrated Air and Missile Defense projects with other nations through the Maritime Missile Defense Projects Framework Memorandum of Understanding of 2004 (as amended 2009, 2015, and 2016). Known as the Maritime Theater Missile Defense (MTMD) Forum, it promotes interoperability with the Navies of eleven participating nations (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States).  This project funds participation in multiple Projects and includes a maritime contribution to the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) project, now known as NATO Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Engineering analysis and recommendations from MTMD activities are provided to European, Pacific and Central Combatant Commands to influence present day operations. Specifically, the MTMD Forum is addressing challenges with "Maritime Allied Air Defense in Support of Ballistic Missile Defense Operations" that face the Combatant Commanders during present day operations.  The MTMD Forum is leveraging At-Sea Demonstration (ASD) test events and operational Fleet Exercises  to integrate technology with concepts of operations developed within MTMD Forum working groups.

The MTMD Forum develops systems and techniques that enhance protection and defense against the proliferation of short, medium and long-range Ballistic Missile (BM) and Advanced Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threats through the development of interoperable sea-based Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) capability among coalition nations.  This includes protection across the full spectrum of these threats through the enhanced utilization of existing sea-based systems to protect against current threats while progressively improving and developing systems and system-of- systems to effectively counter evolving threats. 

This project supports USN participation in several Maritime IAMD related Project Arrangements and Working Groups including:

(1)  Battle Management Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I) to define and develop architectures as well as to perform engineering to address coalition capability gaps. 
(2)  Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition M&amp;S testbed and to perform legacy and future systems simulation testing.
(3)  Coalition Distributed Engineering Plant (CDEP) to establish and maintain a maritime coalition Hardware-in-the-Loop Testbed and to conduct CDEP testing.
(4)  Open Architecture (OA) to develop Interface Standards and Data Models.
(5)  Test Planning and Execution (TPEX) to develop Test Plans, oversee exercise participation and conduct post event data analysis and reporting.
(6)  Operational Requirements (OR) to develop a Coalition Maritime Missile Defense Operational Concept Document and to identify operational constraints and tactical constructs surrounding coalition maritime missile defense activities.
(7)  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities agreements with other nations to support Maritime IAMD and MTMD related demonstrations.
(8) Tactical Advancement for Next Generation (TANG) to work with our Allies and International Partners using human-centered design methodologies to identify solutions to technology and sailor performance issues that have been cited during previously conducted experiments, exercises, and demonstrations.  This process will seek to leverage R&amp;D investments and risk reduction research commercial companies are making today that can provide potential "dual use" technology and process solutions to complex problems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Project 0568: Budget increase of $4.157M from FY20 to FY21 reflects increased costs associated with Fuel, Consumable Parts and organizational maintenance in support of monthly readiness flight hour requirements for NAVAIR test pilots supporting RDT&amp;E of Navy aviation programs.  Increase is based on assessment of FY21 program workload to ensure assigned test pilots accrue a minimum of 11 hours per month between program funded test flights and the 0568 project unit, in order to meet Fleet directed minimum flight hour requirements to ensure safety, reduce the risk of aviation mishaps and ensure proficient test pilots are available to support test and evaluation of aviation acquisition programs. 

Project 0569: Budget increase of $5.915M from FY20 to FY21 reflects increased costs associated with depot maintenance of NAVAIR RDT&amp;E Aircraft. Specifically accounts for increase in costs associated with Planned Depot Maintenance of two KC-130T aircraft and the cost associated with the Planned Depot Maintenance for two E-2D aircraft which were extended in the RDT&amp;E aircraft inventory to support developmental test of planned E-2D upgrades and associated cost increases in Aviation Depot Level Repairable (AVDLR) items which are found deficient during test pilot proficiency/readiness flights on associated type / model / series aircraft in the RDT&amp;E aircraft inventory.  

Project 2924: The 2017 Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) report identified numerous material issues that has resulted in an increase in the required labor and consumable parts to accomplish routine preventive maintenance to prevent recurrence of identified deficiencies and material degradation of Self Defense Test Ship Hull, Mechanical and Electrical (HM&amp;E) systems.  FY2019 funding increase of $4.100M was to accomplish emergent repairs to the Port and Starboard Shaft Bearings.  Without the increase in funding, the Self Defense Test Ship would be unable to get underway for at sea operations to support CVN 78 and DDG 1000 ship self-defense testing.  

Project 3206 FY21 decrease of $0.150M is due to funding reduction rephased into FY22.

Project 3238: Project was established to support the Acquisition Threat Evaluation Projects (ATEP). Funding was realigned within the PE from project 3206 T&amp;E Enterprise.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Aircraft Flight Hours.  This non-acquisition project supports direct flight hour costs associated with NAVAIR test pilot proficiency flights, including organizational and intermediate maintenance, associated consumables, including petroleum, oil and lubricants.  Annual test pilot flight hours, as delineated in OPNAVINST 3710.7 are satisfied through a combination of program funded test flights, which vary year to year based on program schedules; and flights funded through this project unit to ensure a baseline level of pilot readiness. These flight hours ensure test pilots remain proficient in assigned type / model / series aircraft in which they are qualified (approximately 3 hours per month) during lulls in program test schedules to ensure proficient test pilots are available to safely support aviation program testing.  Readiness hours are designed to provide aircrew with a minimum of 11 flight hours per month, for a total of 133 hours annually.  Flight hours support post maintenance acceptance test flights, aircrew training and test pilot proficiency when test program demand is low, in direct support of Research and Development Programs at Naval Air Systems Command, and Office of Naval Research flight activities.   

JUSTIFICATION FOR BUDGET ACTIVITY: This program is funded under RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST and EVALUATION MANAGEMENT SUPPORT because it supports efforts directed toward sustaining or modernizing installations or operations required for general research, development, test and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>Budget Increase of $5.910M from FY20 to FY21 reflects extensions in Fixed Induction Dates as a direct result of engineering evaluations, which resulted in the planned shift of depot events from FY20 to FY21 to support acquisition program flight test objectives.  The budget increase also addresses cost increases in depot maintenance events for two KC-130T's and accounts for a program of record increase in the RDT&amp;E E-2D inventory from two aircraft to five aircraft, resulting in a Depot Maintenance cost increase in FY21.  Additional funding was added to address cost increases associated with Aviation Depot Level Repairables (AVDLR) which directly supports the monthly readiness flight hour requirements for NAVAIR test pilots on all type / model / series (T/M/S) aircraft in the RDTE aircraft inventory.  Cost increases in AVDLR components are a direct result of an increased failure rate and higher cost of parts due to aging airframes and the lack of sufficient T/M/S in the RDT&amp;E inventory to support testing if parts are not replaced.  Funding also addresses "as found" conditions when the RDT&amp;E aircraft are opened up for inspection and maintenance.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The intent of the T&amp;E Enterprise is to consolidate all Air Warfare (AW) Ship Self Defense (SSD) at-sea testing across multiple class ships, beginning with LHD 8, LSD 52, LHA 6, DDG 1000, CVN 78, and Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This consolidated AW SSD test and evaluation approach meets the Probability of Raid Annihilation (PRA) (PRA is defined as a required surface ship defense against Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles), Self Defense Test Ship (SDTS) testing requirements as outlined in Air Warfare Ship Self Defense Enterprise TEMP 1714, and lead/operational ship testing requirements for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) TEMP 1471, Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Blk 2 TEMP 286-2, DDG 1000 TEMP 1560, CVN 78 TEMP 1610, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) TEMP 1415, SSDS TEMP 1400, LHA 6 TEMP 1697, AN/SPQ-9B TEMP 1463, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) TEMP 1658 (Block 1A), and LCS TEMP 1695.

Enterprise Cost elements:

a) SDTS Summary includes installation, check-out and stage testing of the major combat systems elements on the SDTS.

b) SDTS Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the SDTS including:  LSD 52, DDG 1000, LCS and CVN 78.

c) Lead Ship Test includes tracking and firing exercises versus single and dual, subsonic and supersonic ASCM threat surrogates for ship classes in the Enterprise TEMP from the Lead Ship including:  LSD 50, LCS and CVN 78.

d) Testbed includes all modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs required to create OT-quality digital representations of shipboard combat system performance including infrastructure, distributed secure network, common environmental services for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT).

e) Enterprise Testing and Planning includes the contractor and government costs to administer the Enterprise, collect and distribute data from live events, maintain Cybersecurity certifications, and financial management.

f) Maintenance of Combat System (CS) includes the costs for the routine preventive maintenance and repairs of the Combat Systems elements on the SDTS.

The T&amp;E Enterprise merges common ship, element, and system requirements into the least number of test events while leveraging planned Combat System Ship Qualification Trials (CSSQTs) to accomplish Developmental Testing (DT) and Operational Testing (OT) requirements. All tests on the SDTS require the sharing of infrastructure, missile range allocations, execution time and underway time to eliminate duplicative testing.  T&amp;E Enterprise provides end-to-end mission Operational Testing in a realistic operational environment, capitalizing on Probability of Raid Annihilation Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) data validated with results of that Operational and Live Fire Testing, and ensuring a consistent approach across ship classes. Applicability of all test events is beneficial across multiple ship classes with the same variation under test.

Current funding levels do not provide funding for SDTS installation and check-out, SDTS Test, Lead Ship Test, or Testbed modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) costs.  Current funding levels covers core support requirements only which covers combat system maintenance, cybersecurity of installed combat systems, test ship remote control system maintenance (shared with K2924), hardware and infrastructure to support co-located and geographically distributed Testbed baselines. Testbed virtual range development, and documentation of the Testbed. Verification, Validation &amp; Accreditation (VV&amp;A) Master Plan development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Threat Engineering produces Acquisition Threat Evaluation Products (ATEPs) that are inputs to System of System requirements across Program Executive Office (PEO) Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS) platforms, elements, and DoD systems to deliver scalable fleet level performance capability. This program also produces critical, valid T&amp;E assets that satisfy Commander Operational Test &amp; Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) and Director of Operational Test and Evaluation  (DOT&amp;E) requirements as these same tools will be used to support and supplement test and evaluation and training against the assessed threats in both testbed and at-sea configurations, ensuring consistency between the development and T&amp;E acquisition phases.  

ATEP is the surface navy cost effective, affordable, single, common threat modeling architecture that supports its Major Defense Acquisition Program (MDAP), (and other subordinate programs) RDT&amp;E activities throughout the acquisition life cycle and extending through operations and sustainment. ATEP satisfies Life Cycle Mission Planning (LCMP) requirements by providing the threat modeling architecture needs to support systems engineering trade-off analysis, T&amp;E (DT and OT) and operations and sustainment (OA) through testbed evaluation activities.  ATEP is a critical component in ensuring requirements are achievable, affordable and testable.

ATEP provides the required threat models to ensure fleet operational readiness against the threat. Specifically, ATEP Satisfies Operational Test (OT) and Operational Assessment (OA) requirements documented in COMOPTEVFOR ltr 3960 Ser 00/43 of 5 Jun 2018. This requirement specifies ATEP is necessary to provide the surface navy validated Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) threat models for use in the M&amp;S infrastructure supporting OT&amp;E.  Moreover, ATEP satisfies COMOPTEVFOR requirement that threat models must be at a fidelity commensurate with the blue-force system representations and contain intel-derived lethality/vulnerability data, physics-based six degrees-of-freedom models, reactive seekers and guidance, and other engineering data.  ATEP is necessary to evaluate mandatory Key Performance Parameters including operational effectiveness, and suitability to include a systems lethality and survivability, and achieving its performance requirements within operation and sustainment costs.

ATEP provides the threat models necessary to ensure the surface navy 1.) Avoids Technological Surprise and 2.) Eliminates Point Solutions. ATEP satisfies necessary Threat model requirements to conduct warfare systems analysis of alternatives including gaps analysis, and threat systems mission and performance analysis and effectiveness studies supporting both material and non-material solutions while supporting the development of Intelligence Community Tasking Threat. 

With Threat Engineering efforts and development of ATEPs the Navy and PEO IWS will produce substantiated risk and cost based Fleet Level Engineering decisions producing predictable and timely fleet capability against stressing threats. Scalable warfighting performance will be evaluated against the appropriate threat environment, using sufficient, verified and validated models applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis. 

Without Threat Engineering efforts and ATEPs the Navy and the PEO will incur unsubstantiated risk and cost in developing capability for the fleet. Scalable warfighting performance will not be evaluated against the threat environment, sufficient models will not be developed or applied to produce Fleet Level Engineering requirements and gaps analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As a detachment of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, the mission of the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center is to provide the US Navy an underwater range facility for full-spectrum test and evaluation of Undersea Warfare systems and for Fleet training and readiness assessment.  The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center  Program Office is headquartered at Newport, RI.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center's administrative offices are located at West Palm Beach, Florida.  Test facilities are located at Andros Island, Sites 1 through 4, and the Berry Islands in the Bahamas.  Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center aircraft make scheduled daily flights between West Palm Beach and Andros Town Airport.  

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center manages and, under service contract, maintains and operates a 500 square nautical miles deep-water and a 100 square nautical miles shallow-water range; air-target tracking capabilities; sonobuoy simulation systems; electronic warfare threat simulation systems; rotary wing aircraft; aircraft ground support facilities; acoustic targets; torpedo retrieval and flushing capabilities; open-ocean range craft; marine support facilities; and data processing and analysis capabilities.  

Major test facilities on Andros Island are located at Site 1.  The Command Control Building houses the range tracking displays and replay centers, the computer center, operations support functions, communications center, and the central timing system. The Range Support Facility houses a torpedo post-run workshop, Mark 46 /Mark 50 and Mark 54 lightweight torpedo Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 30 undersea target Intermediate Maintenance Activity, a Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo Research and Development Turnaround facility and related technical facilities. The complex includes electrical and physical calibration labs, a complete electronics maintenance shop, a dive locker, a precision machine shop, and logistics support areas.

Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center has a 285-foot concrete pier with a controlling depth of 17 feet (5.2 meters) at mean low tide. An adjacent wharf is approximately 240 feet in length (72 meters) with a controlling depth of 15 feet at mean low tide.  Power is available at both locations.  Facilities at the pier/marine area include fully equipped machine /fabrication and marine overhaul shops.  Also at Site 1, six Range User Buildings are maintained  for assembling test equipment and equipment check-out during test mobilization or dockside periods. These staging areas are equipped with a variety of power sources, gantry cranes, compressed air and security features. A fully equipped range user hanger for ground maintenance and storage of helicopters is located at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center helicopter airstrip.  Sites 2, 3, and 4 are small instrumented areas located south of Site 1 used to extend tracking of sonobuoys, communications, and air target track. This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project provides continuing maintenance and operational support for the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Test and Evaluation capabilities.  These capabilities include the Pacific Ranges and Facilities, consisting of China Lake Ranges and the Point Mugu Sea Range, aerial and surface target launch and recovery, target test instrumentation and Test and Evaluation aircraft.  The Pacific Ranges use China Lake's 1.1 million acres of land and 17,000 square miles of military restricted (R-2508) airspace together with Point Mugu's 125,000 square miles of instrumented sea range and 36,000 square miles of controlled overlying airspace, and airfield and test instrumentation at San Nicolas Island to perform its Test and Evaluation mission.  Included in the China Lake ranges is the Electronic Combat Range, which provides outdoor free space developmental and operational testing of airborne electronic warfare systems and tactics against shipboard and land based air defense systems. These ranges perform metric radar, multilateration and optical  tracking of test objects; command, control,  and destruct for range safety purposes; communications; frequency interference control and analysis; collection processing and display of telemetered data; real-time data processing and display; and the operation of a sub scale aerial target launch capability.  Other test capabilities include sled tracks, measurement facilities; propulsion, warhead, environmental, rocket motor, and other missile component test facilities; and gun ranges.  This project funds costs that are not chargeable to customers.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2021 funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD. DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries. Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack. Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.

The FY 2021 funding increase continues to support the Network Modernization effort. Part of this
modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and
enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and
classified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use
operational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) provides Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) general support funding for headquarters annual operating expenses and ensures COMOPTEVFOR compliance with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directives during the conduct of independent operational testing and evaluation. This funding supports planning, testing, and reporting on the operational effectiveness, suitability, and cyber survivability of new and improved systems and recommending fleet usage to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Funding also supports recently instituted initiatives (including the manpower to execute) that improve COMOPTEVFOR's ability to develop "minimum, adequate" test strategies maximizing efficiencies and minimizing assets required to conduct planned operational testing, thereby driving down overall test and evaluation costs for the Navy. The CNO, as well as acquisition executives and managers at all levels, have a continuing need for expeditious and efficient conduct of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) by COMOPTEVFOR in support of training and equipping fleet forces. To this end, this funding supports COMOPTEVFOR's continued pursuit of a variety of senior management initiatives aimed at increasing efficiencies in T&amp;E; these senior management initiatives include IT Network, database and decision making technology upgrades, implementation of Integrated Testing and Mission Based Test Design across all programs, and improved staffing and expertise in the areas of DON acquisition processes, Modeling and Simulation, Statistical Studies, Information Assurance, and similar disciplines. All of these initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of testing and evaluation, thus ensuring delivery to fleet units of fully tested and capable combat systems. OT&amp;E issues have direct long term Navy-wide implications on the Fleet's readiness and warfighting capability. Rapid advances in technology, changes in fleet tactics, and increased complexity of weapons systems and platforms, combined with reductions in manpower, force structure, and budgets have created an increased need for technical and operational analyses that are sophisticated and timely in order to ensure an optimal return on investment of Navy resources.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>The FY 2020 to FY 2021 funding increase supports additional Cyber Security manpower to meet the Program Cyber Security Operational Tests (OT) required by DoD. DoD mandated an increase in Cyber Security testing due to an increase in cyber intrusions from adversaries. Cyber intrusions continue to challenge our weapon systems' ability to
detect threats, react to threats, and restore system functionality after a cyber-attack. Cyber intrusion prevention requires specialized training, tool sets, and increased proficiency in COMOPTEVFOR's cyber security test manpower.

The FY 2020 to FY 2021 funding increase continues to support the Network Modernization effort. Part of this modernization will strengthen COMOPTEVFOR's presence on the Defense Research Engineering Network (DREN) and enhance collaboration, access and data flow to stakeholders operating on NMCI. COMOPTEVOR legacy unclassified and
classified networks prevent collaboration, sharing, and access to operational test tools, test results, and data with Commands that work for COMOPTEVOR while executing operational testing (VX-1, VX-9, VMX-1, HMX-1), organizations that use operational test products (SYSCOMs, PEO/PMs, Fleet Shore Commands), and VCNO, OPNAV
Resource Sponsors, and ASN/RDA.

The recent decrease from FY20 to FY21 accomplished the movement of Cyberspace Activities from PRJ 0831 to cyber pure PRJ 2958.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Radio Frequency (RF) Management Program. This project develops tools, processes, and algorithms to identify and mitigate EMI sources for Navy systems and platforms.

(a) It will support the Afloat Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Program (AESOP), an automated spectrum Fleet operational capability. The application will be enhanced to comply with fleet operational requirements and streamline Strike Force frequency management processes. It will provide automated Spectrum Management (SM) tools for development of operational task communication and radar/weapon plans to support fleet deployments, exercises, and contingency operations. It will provide identification and mitigation of EMI in Navy, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Allied, Ashore and Joint Combat Operations. It will provide analysis related to spectrum reallocation proposals to assess impacts on Navy operations and systems, as well as for the Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessments.

(b) It will support the Shipboard Electromagnetic Compatibility Improvement Program (SEMCIP) to identify, engineer, and evaluate effectiveness of potential EMI corrections. The program also characterizes and quantifies the operational impact of EMI problems on system's mission performance.

(c) It will support the Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Survivability Program. The program assesses the EMP survivability of all mission critical systems and funds development of a hardness assurance and maintenance program. It will develop improved modeling capability to reduce hardness validation costs at delivery and over the lifetime of the system/platform. The program develops new and updated design criteria, test methodology, test limits, and survivability validation procedures for all Navy systems, ships, submarines and shore facilities.

(d) It will support the Real-Time Spectrum Operations Program (RTSO). The program researches the Electromagnetic (EM) Environmental Effects (E3) between shipboard transmitters and receivers on ships and the interactions of the EM systems within the other systems installed on units within a strike group. The program will develop a capability to monitor the EM Spectrum Usage on a ship and be able to validate the spectrum plan to ensure Electromagnetic Capability (EMC) is achieved within the strike group. The program will develop a capability to display compliance with the spectrum plan in a Common Operational Picture (COP) display. These initial capabilities of Own Force Monitoring provide Battlespace Awareness and will be instrumental in enabling Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare. These capabilities of self-awareness will further enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control (C2) of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain. 

At the direction of OPNAV, in the beginning of FY2018 the project changed the technical approach to mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with the original Hardware (H/W) solution that required extensive integration and networking of all spectrum dependent systems. The revised technical approach simplifies the original hardware plan required in favor of a centralized radio frequency monitoring capability with software applications that can still meet fleet requirements of own force monitoring. This has resulted in near term schedule delay that is recoverable in FY19.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Real-Time Spectrum Operations (RTSO)) develops tools, processes, and algorithms to conduct spectrum planning, sense and monitor, characterize and predict Electromagnetic Environmental Effects(E3), and manage and maneuver to avoid and mitigate Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Electromagnetic (EM) Vulnerability for Navy systems and platforms.

RTSO supports Navy and Marine Corps Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations for global spectrum usage and allocation planning. The effort researches the EM E3 between shipboard transmitters and receivers on ships and the interactions of the EM systems within the other systems installed on units within a strike group.  RTSO will develop a capability to sense and monitor shipboard EM Spectrum Usage and validate the spectrum plan to achieve Emissions Control (EMCON) within the strike group.  The effort will validate and display spectrum plan compliance with a spectrum common operational picture.  This EM spectrum Management Aid with own force monitoring sensor input supports Battlespace Awareness and Information Operations.  These self-awareness and validation capabilities will greatly enhance the Navy's ability to perform Command and Control of the EM Spectrum warfighting domain.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.
(U) Project 1034: Established to exploit all National and Service sensor systems to improve tactical support to Fleet operational commanders.  Project also supports equipment upgrades, training and Fleet exercises which provide the venue for testing modifications to existing programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to rapidly and with certainty: 1) exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) understand the disposition of friendly and adversarial forces, as well as uninvolved/neutral elements in the area of operations; 3) have access to target quality intelligence at the right time to conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries, and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

It includes: 1) persistent surveillance of the maritime and information battlespace; 2) knowledge of how to employ existing and emerging collection capabilities to great effectiveness to gather critical intelligence; 3) penetrating knowledge of the capabilities and intent of our adversaries to hold our successful operations at risk; and 4) expertise within the electromagnetic spectrum. Automation in data extraction and alignment and machine learning algorithms can significantly enhance the human analyst's ability to achieve battlespace awareness in the face of vast data repositories and numerous collection platforms/opportunities.</r2:Description>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $2.000M to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

The net increase of $8.015M from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is primarily due to increased scope of Marine Corps Wargaming Capabilities.  Wargaming Capabilities increase of $8.531M reflects multiple integrated prototyping competitive vendor awards to develop end-to-end, comprehensive/integrated prototypes for the entire life cycle of wargaming from design through execution through postgame analysis which follow with a competitive down select to one contractor in the first half of FY22. The integrated prototype contracting efforts begin in 4QFY20 and complete in 4QFY21. The contractor selected will then provide the production solution starting in FY23. The production system will link up with the new wargaming facility being built by the USMC in MILCON project P-719.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) established Operations Analysis Directorate (OAD) as the sole operations research, analytic support, and studies management program for the Marine Corps Study System (MCSS).  MCSS analysis is achieving greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation through operations research methodologies such as: operational analysis, statistical analysis, multi-objective decision methods, optimization, cost analysis, and a wide range of computer-based models and combat simulations insuring the optimization of resources now and in the future.  Analyses spans the spectrum of conflict in a Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational (JIIM) context to inform critical senior level decision makers of current and future national security issues and provides unique and distinct analytic capabilities that enable the collaboration and sharing of analyses that reduces the duplication of topics that are of broad interest. MCSS is an integral part of the Marine Corps and Joint Chiefs decision-making processes to organize, man, train, equip, sustain, and transform resources from the current to the future force.

This program element has been revised into two specialized analytical divisions: (1) External Analysis Division (EAD) - responsible for providing joint external analysis is the Marine Corps' sole representative in the joint modeling arenas.  Provides deployed on site professional operations analysis support to Special Purpose MAGTFs in CENTCOM and AFRICOM. (2) Combat Development Analysis Division responsible for executing a select portfolio of studies for senior leadership, Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) and Marine Corps Enterprise Integration Plan (MCEIP).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) supports the material acquisition process by managing the Marine Corps Operational Test (OT) programs for Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I through ACAT IV (less OT of manned aircraft) and performs other functions that may be directed by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. The primary purpose of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) is to provide information to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) regarding the Operational Effectiveness (OE) and Operational Suitability (OS) of the system addressed at a decision point. MCOTEA must ensure that the Marines in the Operating Forces receive the very best possible equipment and support. MCOTEA must also ensure each system proposed for acquisition is tested adequately, evaluated objectively, and reported independently.

Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) is the only unit that provides the Marine Corps with required operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) capability, ensuring the Marine Corps is compliant with laws and regulations, and ensuring that training and equipment are operationally effective, relevant, and suitable.  Additionally, MCOTEA's early involvement, coordination, and oversight in developmental testing and evaluation of new combat and combat support systems ensures that our Marines are the best trained, and have the best equipment, with the lowest test costs for taxpayers. Finally, MCOTEA's support of rapid acquisitions ensures that Marines in the fight are supported with the newest and most advanced equipment and that the Marine Corps is compliant with regulations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Family of Incident Response Systems (FIRS) consists of equipment, systems, and services designed to provide Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident response forces the capabilities needed to effectively respond to a terrorist attack using Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE). FIRS meets the mission requirements for the detection; mass casualty decontamination; force protection; responder inter-agency interoperability; Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I); urban search and rescue; medical and general support requirements needed by these forces to mitigate the effects of a CBRNE terrorist attack. FIRS relies primarily on Commercial Off-The-Shelf/Non-Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) equipment and systems that meet the particular mission requirements of Consequence Management (CM).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Wargaming Capability (WGC) program office is unique from other programs in that the program office is responsible for the system of systems within the facility as well as coordinating the unique manpower requirements.  The USMC Wargaming Capability (WGC) consists of Wargaming tools and systems, a Wargaming Center (MILCON Project P-719), and the necessary personnel supporting the new capability.  This capability will facilitate force development, war plan assessment, and concept and combat development through an integrated purpose-built facility utilizing highly classified information embedded in all aspects of planning, execution, and analysis. WGC will provide an enhanced basis for analytically-informed decision support to capability development prioritization and resourcing. The WGC program acquisition strategy takes advantage of 10 U.S.C 2302 Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) and was designated a MTA for Rapid Prototyping in May 2019.  The overarching strategy consists of three phases: Phase I: Risk Reduction Prototyping (FY19 - FY20); Phase II: Integrated Prototyping (FY20 - FY22); Phase III: Follow-on Production (FY23 - FY25+).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>PM WGC was designated as a Middle Tier of Acquisition. In FY20 PM WGC continues efforts in Phase I: Risk Reduction Prototyping and executes Phase II: Integrated Prototyping through the use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements with traditional and non-traditional defense contractors. The OTAs awarded during Phase I Risk Reduction Prototyping will support and develop an informed performance specification for the Integrated Prototyping phase by establishing the feasibility/viability of current state-of-the-art technologies and capabilities. In Phase II: Integrated Prototyping, PM WGC will award OTAs to two or more vendors for the full representative wargaming solution in 4QFY20. Major milestones for Phase II, within FY20 are: planning and execution of an initial design review and technical interchange meeting and initial vendor deliverables including their software and product development strategy.  These development efforts will take into account sustainability, maintainability, and training requirements for the USMC.

                                        <r2:Text>Continue multiple vendor-built prototype efforts by focusing on solutions that combine four different capability sets: (1) wargame design and scenario generation; (2) scalable intelligent data services; (3) player interface and visualization; (4) advanced analytic tools. Major milestones for Phase II within FY21 are: (a) the creation of final allocated baselines based upon performance specification requirements for the system; (b) development and integration of multiple components of the proposed solutions; (c) Tailored Test Readiness Review to evaluate the readiness of the prototype to proceed into Developmental Testing; (d) Developmental Testing of each vendor's proposed solution.   PM WGC will execute a final design review, developmental test, and cyber evaluation review of each vendor prototype.  Developmental testing and cyber evaluation of the vendor-built prototypes in FY21 will lead to a single vendor selection in FY22. Prototypes support the development of the world class wargaming solution, built upon the four capability sets that incorporates data capture tools, data analysis tools, advanced models and simulations, cross domain solutions, dynamic 2-D to 3-D visualization, player interface tools, and scenario generation. Continue to document the allocated baseline and the follow-on system baseline. Continue development of cybersecurity measures and logistics elements (e.g. sustainability, maintainability, and training).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Information Environment (IE) is a global, interconnected, complex, continuously changing eco-system that is increasingly connected across our war fighting functions.  Given the complexity and the speed of changes in the IE and to address the significant role information now plays in current and future conflicts, a unifying operational and technical strategy must be developed to outpace our adversaries.

Analysis will inform the development and integration of Marine Corps Information Environment Operations (IE Ops) that are guided by the Commandant's Strategic Plan, Marine Corps Operating Concepts (MOC).  Research and analysis efforts support: design and coordinated implementation of an Objective Network to fight on and through a contested environment; design and collaboration on a Naval Tactical Grid and a Joint Tactical Grid; a threat estimate to inform capability development; and analysis to inform the development and fielding of an integrated information capability.  These efforts will be accomplished leveraging analytic support from government Labs and Industry to dynamically exploit our National Defense Strategy (NDS) priority operational problems related to the Information Environment through limited user evaluations and functional capability assessments with Marines.  In addition, rapid development of capabilities to address problems in the IE Ops will be developed utilizing the Accelerator process which utilizes best commercial practice of design thinking.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Allied/Coalition Maritime Environment (ACME) 0798:
This project promotes interoperability with allied and coalition forces by facilitating maritime interoperability in both processes and communication systems, including emerging capabilities, to counter growing high-end asymmetric threats. 

Space &amp; Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering 2144:
This project is a systems engineering non-acquisition program to develop, test, implement Technical Authority (TA) products, and validate Naval Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System architectures to support naval, Joint and Coalition missions across normal, contested, and degraded cyber/operational environments.  The objective of this project is carried out by multiple tasks that ensure development and delivery of Naval Information Warfare (IW) capabilities that are well-integrated, interoperable, secure, and resilient to meet validated warfighting requirements.  

The Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Architecture 2147:
This project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment (JIE) and Intelligence Community (IC) Information Technology Environment (ITE). This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will also help instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR Program of Record (POR) progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture.

Fleet Experimentation 3319:  
The U.S. Navy's Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) project advances/augments operational and tactical warfighter capabilities through the experimentation of high payoff initiatives, technologies and concepts, Fleet Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), doctrine, and new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). The main focus of FLEX between 2018 and 2024 is to operationalize "A Design For Maintaining Maritime Superiority" Blue Line of Effort (LOE) through the execution of Fleet Design materiel/non-materiel capability employment.  

Trident Warrior Project 3320: 
The U.S. Navy's Trident Warrior (TW) experimentation campaign enables early delivery of capabilities to the warfighter via Fleet-directed Trident Warrior operational events with an emphasis on United States Fleet Forces/Commander Pacific Fleet (USFF/CPF) directed focus areas. 
  
Maritime Communications Demonstration Project 3420:
Classified Project Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) is not a new start.  Funding was realigned from project 3319 FLEX in FY18. The Expeditionary SFOC Communications is developing and experimenting innovative concepts designed to validate both materiel and non-materiel methodologies to provide resilient command and control within the maritime domain.  Identified previous work done within Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) channels, and will leverage lessons learned.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The ACME program advances Information Warfare (IW) (to include Command, Control, Communications, Computers; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Electronic Warfare (EW); and Cyber Warfare), interoperability with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States (AUSCANNZUKUS), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other Allied and Coalition partners. The program determines maritime operational gaps with our allies, identifies Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) solutions with the potential to fill those gaps, and assesses these solutions and associated concepts of operation in laboratory and at-sea environments. The ACME program includes integration and testing in support of joint and Allied war fighting capabilities, including interoperability testing of IW equipment. Allied and joint interoperability is critical for future maritime operations, especially as the United States Navy (USN) expands Internet Protocol (IP) networking throughout the fleet via Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Networks (NGEN), Mission Partner Environment/ Future Mission Networking (MPE/FMN), the U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System - eXtended (BICES-X), and with the Joint Information Environment (JIE).
Currently, IP connectivity with AUSCANNZUKUS and other Allied/Coalition forces is limited, requiring extensive backhaul through ashore infrastructure. Higher bandwidth solutions suitable for use over tactical networks require development and assessment for emerging coalition and joint interoperability requirements, such as Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), Network Operations Without Shore (NOWS), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low-bandwidth (DDIL) operations, and to counter Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) threats. Increases in data throughput are required for the effective exchange of rich IW data sets and services via Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the limitations of High Frequency (HF), Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), and other portions of the radio frequency spectrum, coupled with appropriate Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (IA/CND) mechanisms. Development and assessment of potential solutions will integrate improved IP capabilities with the Advanced Digital Network Systems (ADNS) and existing international standards (e.g. Allied Communications Publication 200, NATO Standardization Agreements 5066 and 4691). The continued development and refinement of advanced tactical networking technologies and protocols, to include Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities as well as Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) standards, will provide for a significant improvement in secure data sharing within, and between, coalition maritime elements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>To support Navy objectives in advancing Information Warfare (IW) capabilities, the Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW) Engineering project provides three main functions:

(1) Perform System of Systems (SoS) Cybersecurity Engineering; develop the architectures, specifications and standards, tools, and processes to support a single integrated Navy plan for cybersecurity. These engineering artifacts provide Navy specific guidance to drive common and consistent implementation of security controls across current and future Navy Programs of Record/projects. This eliminates redundancies and inefficiencies characteristic of previous stove-pipe development efforts in which each system addressed security individually. These efforts enable a standardized approach to move out faster to improve the Navy's cyber resiliency. Provide the cybersecurity vulnerability and functional test capability, which supports cybersecurity test requirements and the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) components of Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWARSYSCOM) Information Warfare (IW) Capability Testing Lab (formerly USS SECURE). NAVWAR Cyber Security Testing Capability/Labs is a cyber assessment program within the Navy. This SoS (Afloat, Aloft, C4I &amp; Shore) capability in a test laboratory environment provides a rapidly re-configurable capability that integrates maritime hardware systems into a virtual platform. This platform level SoS provides cybersecurity research, development, test and evaluation, and training, not otherwise possible. This combination of Systems Commands (SYSCOM) laboratories, cyber ranges, and Red Teams simulating Navy platforms in operational maritime environments is critical for effectively evaluating cyber threats against specified mission threads.

(2) Perform System of Systems (SoS) Capability Roadmapping and Engineering; define an integrated Enterprise Architecture to support design, development and delivery of integrated Navy Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Business Information Technology (IT), and Space System capabilities. This architecture reflects current (as-is) and future (target) end states to support technical analyses, program planning, and enterprise-level investment decisions across IW capabilities. Perform mission based system of systems analysis to ensure integration and interoperability, and validate end-to-end warfighting capabilities to quickly address emerging threats. Provides engineering tools and processes to drive rigorous Systems Engineering discipline across the acquisition lifecycle to support rapid development and delivery of secure and interoperable C4ISR, Business IT, and Space Systems capabilities that meet Fleet requirements. Conduct Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) to provide independent, objective assessments of technical maturity and compliance with applicable architectures, specifications and standards across IW capabilities. The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) provides a means to demonstrate and evaluate the interoperability of United States (US), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and coalition information sharing systems.

(3) Navy Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology aligns to CNO priorities to deliver revolutionary capabilities to improve fleet readiness. These enterprise solutions will provide the foundation to (a) enhance warfighter capability through new innovative system designs; (b) increase readiness through low volume production of hard to source items; and (c) improve warfighting capacity by enabling production at or near the point of need. Specific efforts include the development of an Enterprise Digital Manufacturing Architecture which addresses design and certification of AM capabilities for both afloat and ashore, development of Cyber Security Risk Management Profiles for devices and applications on operational networks, definition of a secure Technical Data Package to describe components that can be digitally manufactured, and the development of an overarching, enterprise-level Digital Manufacturing Thread (device management, digital rights management, licensing, configuration management, data storage rule/access and application programing interfaces).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Integrated architectures provide a technical framework for assessing capability gaps and performance of individual systems and System of Systems (SoS) and their ability to effectively provide the desired effects to support warfighting missions. They also serve as a means to influence and drive Programs of Record (PoR) toward a common, more efficient state that promotes interoperability and security.

The Naval Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Reference Architecture project is intended to guide system of systems capability development and promote interoperability across Navy ISR programs, as well as interoperability and alignment with Department of Defense (DoD)-wide enterprise initiatives including Joint Information Environment and Intelligence Community Information Technology Environment and Space &amp; Naval Warfare Systems Command-wide Enterprise Architecture policies. This effort to develop integrated ISR architectures will instill systems engineering discipline and standardization across the Navy ISR Enterprise and provide a means by which to assess ISR PoR progress in conforming to a single Navy architecture. These efforts will reduce Information Technology/ISR infrastructure complexity and variances, making it easier to manage, operate and defend our ISR capabilities, and help inform investment decisions across the Navy's ISR enterprise to support Assured Command and Control, Battlespace Awareness and Integrated Fires.

This effort will encompass the documentation and analysis of current ISR enterprise architectures to inform and guide requirements for target architecture development and performance requirements to support full use and incorporation of ISR capabilities to advance Navy operations afloat. The associated studies will produce both technical and non-technical implementation guidance across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel and Facilities spectrum.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Chief of Naval Operations Fragmented Order (FRAGO) 01/2019 signed December 2019, focuses on improved warfighting using experiments and exercises in venues such as Large Scale Exercises (LSE) and Fleet Battle Problems to assess implementation progress for concepts like Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO).  Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) funds are used to implement Fleet Design through foundational warfighting concepts like DMO and is a proven and efficient approach to improving warfighting effectiveness. FLEX resources the experimentation venues - operationally representative environments - to focus solutions on to solving warfighting problems and maturing foundational warfighting concepts.  Through experimentation, concept solutions are tested, refined, and used to support acquisition strategy and inform procurement decisions.  The FLEX program addresses warfighting gaps identified in: Integrated Prioritized Capability Lists (IPCL) generated by Warfighting Development Centers (WDC), Fleet Integrated Priorities Letter (IPL), Fleet Commanders' FLEX Guidance, Navy Urgent Operational Needs Statements, Fleet Design, DMO, and other concepts.  Additionally, through experimentation activities such as workshops, war simulations, live at-sea events, and experimentation campaigns, the FLEX program examines potential materiel and non-materiel solutions that will enhance the Fleet's ability to execute assigned missions. FLEX events and campaigns are comprised of all facets of experimentation including design, planning, systems engineering and integration, execution, data collection, analysis, assessment, and the delivery of tangible products. While Naval-centric, FLEX efforts include joint, coalition, Science and Technology (S&amp;T), academia, and industry partners.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) is a collaborative effort with multiple partners designed to address prioritized capability gaps to produce Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) actions. FLEX deliverables are focused on operational and tactical warfighting capabilities in the near term (within the Future Years Defense Plan) and prioritized by annual Fleet (CUSFF, CPF, CNE-AF) Commanders' guidance to enhance warfighting capability across all warfare areas.  FLEX is the enabler to Fleet Design and its experimentation initiatives support delivery of Navy Operational Architecture (NOA), Fleet Warfighting Training Continuum (FWTC) and Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO).   

FLEX supports efforts for workshops, in-port and at-sea experiments, and war simulations.  FLEX provides venues and the expertise to identify DOTMLPF-P gaps for sponsored programs/technologies prior to delivery to the Fleet, with the goal of delivering capability wholeness to the warfighter. FLEX is vital to continuously improving critical naval warfighting capabilities identified in the Navy's Concept for Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) signed by CNO Feb 2019 and "A Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority 2.0" signed by CNO Dec 2018</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Maritime Communications Demonstration (MCD) project is a classified program responsible for developing concepts designed to validate material and non-material solutions providing resilient Command and Control (C2) within the maritime domain. The focus is to demonstrate capabilities leveraging existing DOD investments and infrastructure to move data and information. Demonstration will include maritime assets, experimental methodologies, and current backhaul architecture for data movement.The key deliverable will be a series of at sea demonstrations to validate maritime segment components in an operationally representative environment.  This is not a new start.  In FY17 $2.8M of funding was managed from within the Fleet Experimentation (FLEX) program and used for MCD project tasking for transparency. This effort is part of Secretary of Defense's (SECDEF) third offset initiative and was identified as a required operational capability by USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USSTRATCOM. This effort will fund limited technical development and a series of at-sea demonstrations raising the technical readiness levels of various components with a cable handling and deployment system in an operationally representative environment, with the intent to rapidly transition to an operational capability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This effort provides an OT&amp;E approach to protect Marine Corps critical Cyber information and intelligence through vulnerability evaluations of all major DoD weapons systems and critical military installations; as directed by Section 1650 of Public Law 114-328 (NDAA for FY2017) and Section 1647 of Public Law 114-92 (NDAA FY2016). This will be accomplished through protection, detection, response, restoration, remediation, and mitigation. Testing and evaluation will be completed at Marine Corps facilities and Government Labs, to include the Marine Corps Cyber Range, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA).

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Assessments will end in 2020 with the submission of the final report. Strategies mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize Department of Energy (DoE) and Department of Defense (DoD) national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress.

Funding will be used for assessments and non-recurring engineering for mitigations related to the  Navy's major weapons systems  identified in Joint Requirements Oversight Committee Memorandum (JROCM) 039-16 and on prioritized critical shore infrastructure.

Sec. 1647 of the FY16 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense by not later than December 31, 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will build upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and shall not duplicate similar ongoing efforts such as Task Force Cyber Awakening or conduct redundant assessment on systems that have already been evaluated. 

Sec. 1647 assessment will be formalized in Vulnerability Assessment Reports (VARs), Cyber Table Top Exercises (CTTXs), Cyber Risk Analysis (CRAs) and other reporting. 

Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize DoE and DoD national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.
Program is to support Cyber Vulnerability Evaluations Assessments of E6B and Other Aviation Platforms.

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Vulnerability Assessments and Evaluations program funds cyber vulnerability assessments of critical shore infrastructure as directed by Section 1650 of the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).  Funding will be used for assessments of prioritized critical shore infrastructure.  Sec. 1650 of the FY17 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessment of this infrastructure during a preliminary pilot program that will assess no fewer than two installations by December, 31 2019. Funded vulnerability assessments will end by calendar year 2020 and will build upon existing mission assurance, blue team, and red team capabilities.  As instructed by the Congressional language, the assessments will utilize DoE and DoD national laboratory partnerships.  Assessments will end with the submission of a final report to Congress. Strategies and procedures for mitigating the risk of cyber vulnerabilities should be identified during the course of evaluation.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Executive Order 13587 and the National Insider Threat Policy mandate all United States Government departments and agencies to implement insider threat programs that monitor user activity on all classified networks and provide an insider threat analytical and response capability. The Counter Insider Threat Capability (CITC) is the Department of the Navy's implementation of this requirement.  CITC's mission is to deter, detect, and respond to the threat from witting and unwitting insiders. The Personnel Risk Indicator Detection Enterprise (PRIDE) is the materiel solution required to support the CITC mission, and it will consist of two parts: (1) User Activity Monitoring (UAM), which will monitor user activity on Navy networks, and (2) an Integrated Tool Suite (ITS), which will provide the Information Technology platform for the analytic and response capabilities.  The PRIDE system will provide the technology required by the Department of the Navy Insider Threat Hub to comply with the National mandates and to protect Navy data, equipment, and personnel from insider threats.  RDT&amp;E,N funding is required to develop, integrate, and perform testing and evaluation of this capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>(U) Link Crimson (Navy Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities (TENCAP)) is a congressionally directed program to rapidly develop (12-18 months) systems, processes, and training that leverages and exploits National Technical Means (NTM) and Intelligence Community (IC) resources to meet fleet tactical warfighting gaps.  This is done through innovative research and development of capabilities aligned with Navy Programs of Record (PoR), while influencing national systems support and development.  These efforts include advanced sensors, platform and ground processing, and integrated national-to-tactical information fusion capabilities. Link Crimson supports all Navy mission areas, including Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Integrated Air and Missile Defense, Mine Warfare (MIW), Power projection/Precision Strike, Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), in support of the Navy's Information Dominance pillars: Assured Command and Control (AC2), Battlespace Awareness (BA) and Integrated Fires (IF).
(U) This program is funded under Budget Activity 6 because it supports the operations and installations required for general research and development.   Program baseline addresses research and development on specific capabilities to support these mission areas such as signals collection and exploitation, acoustic and electronic signal detection, countering Unmanned Air Systems, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED) processes, Commercial Maritime Navigation Radar (CMNR) detection and exploitation, open-ocean surveillance, and hostile threat geo-location.  Link Crimson fields both prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities in real world environments in coordination with operational users, and develops warfighting capabilities for insertion into Navy, joint, and national agency programs of record.   Additional detailed information is available at higher levels of classification.

                                <r2:Description>The Navy must assure its ability to command and control forces. This requires capabilities that enable commanders to rapidly and with certainty: 1) exchange orders and responses with subordinates; 2) understand the disposition of friendly and adversarial forces, as well as uninvolved/neutral elements in the area of operations; 3) have access to target quality intelligence at the right time to conduct strikes as part of the joint force; and 4) assess the result of those strikes. Sensing the environment, understanding our adversaries, and operating and defending our communications and networked systems are inextricably linked to the assurance of C2.</r2:Description>

It includes: 1) persistent surveillance of the maritime and information battlespace; 2) knowledge of how to employ existing and emerging collection capabilities to great effectiveness to gather critical intelligence; 3) penetrating knowledge of the capabilities and intent of our adversaries to hold our successful operations at risk; and 4) expertise within the electromagnetic spectrum. Automation in data extraction and alignment and machine learning algorithms can significantly enhance the human analyst's ability to achieve battlespace awareness in the face of vast data repositories and numerous collection platforms/opportunities.</r2:Description>

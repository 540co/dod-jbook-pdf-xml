            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)). RDT&amp;E funds are applied to continue the research and investigation of multifactor authentication and credential alternatives and the development of a registry that may allow DoD to supplement current public key infrastructure and DoD self-service authentication solutions.  Funding is also used to research security and standards compliance improvements for the CAC and the USID card, which provides identification for personnel not eligible for the CAC.  Funding for the Identity Credential Management (ICM) and Enterprise Data Services (EDS) programs supports the DoD Chief Information Officer’s Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM) initiatives.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In accordance with the directive from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense regarding identifying cyber-related funding, DHRA has established a Program Element (PE) for Cyber - 0303140SE.  The following programs, EDS, EHRIS, PA, and PSA have transferred funding to that PE beginning in FY 2021 and are included in a separate R2 exhibit, with the exception of PSA.  The Cyber funding portion for PSA will be transferred to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) along with the non-cyber funding for the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) mission and is not seen on the R2 for the 0303140SE PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification
The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)). This PE includes application of R&amp;D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and/or modernize operations required for general RDT&amp;E.

Project 1:  Identity Credential Management (ICM) is the realignment of the Enterprise Human Resource Information System (EHRIS), as discussed in Project 10 below.  DMDC executes DHRA’s responsibility to provide a central source of identification and authorization of people during and after their affiliation with DoD for identity protection, security, entitlements, and benefits verification. This funding will support the evaluation and testing emerging technologies that will develop more robust and secure capabilities for the Department’s ICM program. ICM will also research capabilities such as improved remote identity proofing and self-service solutions, and micro-services that will enable more efficient credential delivery.

Project 2: Office of People Analytics (OPA) Testing and Assessment Division administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits.  The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and students (high school and post secondary) and to report recruit quality data to Congress.  High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and over 750,000 students in the ASVAB career exploration program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs.  This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise.  Ongoing RDT&amp;E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information.  In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn. 

Project 3:  The Personnel Accountability (PA) program is comprised of several systems, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Defense Travel System (DTS)/Defense Travel System Modernization and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, DoD, DoS and USAID contractors and U.S. citizens.  This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of military operations, contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  

Project 4:  Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation.  The Defense Information System for Security (DISS) mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community.  

Project 5:  The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) administers many of the federal responsibilities of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986 and other federal military voter registration and assistance laws.  FVAP works to ensure Service members, their eligible family members and overseas citizens are aware of their right to vote and have the tools and resources to successfully do so – from anywhere in the world.  FVAP works to Increase the likelihood of interested Active Duty Members to use available FVAP resources to increase their level of awareness of available DoD voting assistance resources, which will increase the likelihood of returning their absentee ballot.  FVAP conducts voting research projects with States, local election jurisdictions and private entities to assist UOCAVA voters to register to vote and submit their absentee ballot and improve federal, State and local election processes and procedures.

Project 6:  Enterprise Data Management (EDS) is addressing two critical projects in FY 2021: 1) JOM and 2) EDDIE.  The Joint Officer Management (JOM) modernization initiative will support improvements in the Joint Manpower Information System’s (JMIS) automation, reliability, accuracy, and system interoperability to enable the Department to more effectively comply with Title 10 management requirements of Joint Duty Officers in the Active and Reserve forces, and improve the sight picture of joint officer personnel capabilities and readiness for the SECDEF and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  JMIS is the DoD’s sole IT system to inform the SECDEF and CJCS on their operational joint personnel officer readiness capability.  The system is used to track joint duty billets, and the officers assigned to them. It also tracks joint duty experiences, education, training, and qualifications for facilitation of joint duty officer assignments and promotions.  The legacy system was built in the 1990’s and is no longer agile enough to support today’s mission.  This modernization project will bring JOM into the 21st century and address critical cybersecurity, legislative, and policy compliance issues.

The Enterprise Data to Decisions Information Environment (EDDIE) introduces a streamlined way to provide person based “data as a service” and “analytics as a service” to all of DoD and other Federal Agencies. It enables and improves all types of analytics from standard reporting to more emergent and embedded predictive/prescriptive analytics.  EDDIE will assist decision makers in forming relevant questions, retrieving pertinent information, and informing policy and program changes.  In FY 2021 development will begin based on the findings of the Analysis of Alternatives.

Project 7:  Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID).  DSAID serves as the Department’s only centralized, case-level database for the collection and maintenance of information regarding sexual assaults involving Service members, via both Unrestricted and Restricted Reporting options.  Also, DSAID accommodates a variety of uses, including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services, support sexual assault prevention and response (SAPR) program administration, congressional reporting requirements, and data analysis.  DSAID will also facilitate reports to Congress on claims of retaliation in connection with an Unrestricted Report of sexual assault made by or against a member of the Armed Forces, and serve as a repository for documents necessary for future victim support.  Service Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARCs) use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of support requirements that facilitate sexual assault case transfer between SARCs and Services.  

The DoD SAPR Office and Service headquarters-level users access the system as a management tool for statistical analysis, tracking, congressional and ad-hoc reporting, evaluating program effectiveness, conducting research, and case and business management.  The system can easily export data for analysis in statistical applications, such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to facilitate analysis at the DoD-level.  DSAID includes safeguards to shield personally identifiable information (PII) from unauthorized disclosure and stringent user access control in place.

Project 8:  Currently CAP utilizes a Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) product designed to support the program’s robust mission.  This product, CAP Portal, is used primarily to process DoD and other government agencies requests for hardware, software, training, and other miscellaneous accommodation services.  CAP Portal also processes information pertaining to developing and tracking requirements packages, market research, events and outreach to include proposals, presentations, materials, and assistive technology.  The CAP Portal allows staff and contract support personnel to utilize all aspects of its functionality to facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations, and run various reports to make financial forecasts with the data that is contained within the system.  However, there are components and functionality that are no longer being utilized and others needed, but it is risky to remove or disable due to the interconnected nature of the codebase.  The previous codebase utilized an outdated framework that was difficult to maintain. The CAP RDT&amp;E program ended in FY 2019.

Project 10: Enterprise Human Resources (HR) Information Systems (EHRIS) is responsible for developing and maintaining the Information Technology (IT) systems that support Civilian Personnel processes across DoD.  The Enterprise Human Resource Information System (EHRIS) is comprised of the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), Civilian HR IT Managed Services, Civilian HR IT Enterprise Services, and Civilian HR IT Program Planning and Management.  In compliance with a 2018 Reform Management Group decision, DMDC has begun migrating the Human Resources Core capabilities onto a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering. SaaS solutions do not require development activity, so This project has been realigned to a new project line above: (Identity Credential Management((ICM)), which provides much of the underlying identification and authorization activities for Department personnel.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The PA program is comprised of three sub-programs: Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and the Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, DoD, DOS and USAID contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of military operations, contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  SPOT is the DoD, DOS and USAID system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in contingency and military operations.  JPARR is a SIPR only application that provides daily person-level location reporting.  JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail.  NTS is a certified and accredited DoD tracking system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during evacuations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In coordination with PACOM, DMDC will be creating the ability to pre-populate a NEO with the affected population to ensure faster more accurate accountability.   Personnel Accountability will be looking at an effort to analyze and develop a plan to migrate SPOT-ES from the .NET framework to the Java technology stack standard supported by DMDC which will allow development and operations to live on DMDC shared application infrastructure.   

Personnel Accountability will also work towards several new modernization efforts to include development and implementation of distributed processing, business intelligence and geographic information system (GIS) tools to support the Contingency Tracking System (CTS) and Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR) systems.  Additionally we will research and create an integration plan for the possible use of Blue Force Tracking data and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) scanning technologies for evacuation and personnel accounting operations.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) Portal has been certified as a Defense Business System (DBS). This project helped CAP obtain and maintain an optimized and certified DBS that executes data collection, records management, and reporting accountability for all stakeholders.  In order to enhance areas of program data-tracking capabilities and stabilize the environment for future operations, CAP required modernization of the CAP Portal.  The CAP Portal has pages/controls that have accumulated up to 7,000 lines of code, making it difficult to ensure the reliability of any updates made to the system which has undergone over 500 change requests since its launch.
There were components and functionality that were no longer being utilized and others needed.  The current codebase utilized an outdated framework that was difficult to maintain.  The CAP Modernization Project implemented a .NET Model View Controller (MVC) framework to separate the business, display and input layers of the code.  Restructuring CAP Portal was necessary to ensure flexibility and reliability.  As a result of an outdated framework, the current CAP Portal is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain and less reliable when making updates.  The CAP Modernization Project provided a restructured database for CAP Portal with an updated codebase to provide a solid foundation that supports CAP’s current structure and business processes while also increasing flexibility for future enhancements and efficiencies.  All aspects of the CAP Portal were enhanced by this project, which provided a streamlined foundation on which to incorporate new internal processing workflow entitled ONE CAP.  It provided the ability to implement new processes that reflect the current organization, roles, responsibilities, tasks and specific workflow and assignments.  The modernization of technology ensured full integration of the new internal operating model.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In accordance with the directive from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense regarding identifying cyber-related funding, DHRA has established a Program Element (PE) for Cyber - 0303140SE.   A total of $1,273 thousand was transferred to the cyber PE from PE 0605803SE in FY 2021.  Subsequently, the PSA portion of the cyber funds in FY 2021 ($161 thousand) and remaining outyears, will be transferred to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), along with the non-cyber funding for the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) program.  The cyber PE of 0303140SE consists of the remaining programs: EDS, ICM, and PA.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&amp;R)). This PE includes application of R&amp;D to support cybersecurity improvements across the DHRA enterprise.

Project 1: Enterprise Data Services (EDS). Supports the cybersecurity activities related to DMDC’s EDS mission. EDS is addressing two critical projects in FY 2021: 1) The Joint Officer Management (JOM) modernization initiative and 2)The development of the Enterprise Data to Decisions Information Environment (EDDIE).  
The legacy system JOM system was built in the 1990s and requires extensive redevelopment to resolve existing security issues and ensure new development complies with Department cybersecurity policies.

EDDIE introduces a streamlined way to provide person based “data as a service” and “analytics as a service” to all of DoD and other Federal Agencies. EDDIE will assist decision makers in forming relevant questions, retrieving pertinent information, and informing policy and program changes. In FY 2021 development will begin based on the findings of the Analysis of Alternatives; ensuring compliance with cybersecurity policies during and after this initial implementation will be a key component of successful system delivery.  This funding will be used to obtain support from cybersecurity experts during development.

Project 2: Identity Credential Management (ICM). DMDC executes DHRA’s responsibility to provide a central source of identification and authorization of people during and after their affiliation with DoD for identity protection, security, entitlements, and benefits verification. This funding will support the evaluation and testing emerging technologies that will develop more robust and secure capabilities for the Department’s ICM program, including the analysis of the security posture of these technologies.

Project 3: Personnel Accountability (PA).  This program is comprised of several systems, including: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), Defense Travel System (DTS)/Defense Travel System Modernization and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, DoD, DoS and USAID contractors and U.S. citizens.  This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of military operations, contingencies, military readiness, reporting of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  This funding will be used to obtain support from cybersecurity experts during the modernization of these systems.

Note: The Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) program  provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation.  The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. In FY 2021, responsibility for DISS, including cybersecurity support, will transfer to the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DEOMI's mission is to develop and deliver world-class human relations education, training, research and innovative solutions to enhance total force readiness.  

To accomplish this mission, DEOMI uses RDT&amp;E funds to support the management of both basic and applied research initiatives / programs. This includes: 
•	The research, development, testing, evaluation, and transition of new DEOMI curriculum, technologies, training resources, and human relations job-aids. 
•	Policy and strategy development support to DMOC, ODEI, SAPRO, and other high-level DoD organizations.
•	DEOMI’s Summer Faculty Research Program, Summer STEM internship program, and collaborations with external academic and government agencies.

Together, these initiatives ensure DEOMI fields up-to-date training programs and deploys cutting edge training and support technologies / materials across the DoD. This is required by Executive Orders 13111 and 13218, which mandate all federal agencies to take full advantage of technological advances to educate and train the workforce, to ensure employees acquire the skills and learning needed to succeed in a changing workplace, and to report on the training technologies used.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

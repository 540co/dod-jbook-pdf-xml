                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s primary basic research portfolio dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction and consequence management communities. The portfolio addresses this through fundamental research focused on making revolutionary scientific discoveries relevant to emerging and future Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction and Improvised Threat Network (CWMDITN) challenges. Program managers drive interdisciplinary portfolios primarily drawing from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and information and network sciences to:  train the next-generation workforce; advance the fundamental knowledge and understanding in the sciences; promote university research to support the CWMDITN mission; and facilitate transition of research to support our warfighters.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Basic Research for Countering WMD project, as the nation’s primary basic research portfolio dedicated to countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD), is a core strategic investor in future scientific and technological progress across the full spectrum of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA) mission areas. This project concentrates on high risk, high-payoff basic research, leveraging world-class expertise in academia, government, and industry, to increase the foundational body of scientific knowledge supporting DTRA’s Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development projects.

This project aligns with DTRA’s strategic objectives that support policy and planning guidance from the Executive Office of the President, the DoD, and the broader WMD threat reduction community. The portfolio addresses this guidance through capability enhancements, projects, and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investments that support CWMD and reduce global nuclear dangers. Specifically, they include: accelerating the development of standoff radiological/nuclear detection capabilities; researching countermeasures and defenses to non-traditional agents; securing vulnerable materials; developing an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are states, networks, or individuals; defeating WMD agents; researching biologically-based and inspired materials for DoD applications; and leveraging science, technology, and innovation through domestic and international partnerships and agreements.

This project solicits, coordinates, and conducts research to build a robust, forward-looking fundamental research portfolio targeting strategic, mission-focused, basic research with high potential impact for CWMD. The research projects are selected for scientific merit, technical quality, and the potential for innovation.  Each research project offers opportunities to expand the knowledge base to help the warfighter, to bring to bear new science solutions with a fresh approach, or to leverage revolutionary approaches to technical surprise, building a foundation for future CWMD solutions. This research will enable new capabilities to: better understand the environment, threats and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and/or dispose of WMD threats; and safeguard the force by managing consequences.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Asymmetric threats are characterized by an environment in which an adversary employs a combination of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, and/or terrorism to obtain their objectives.  The end-state of the PE is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of research projects, taking the most promising proposals and translating them into practical prototypes for use against asymmetric threats.

Activities within this PE are driven by efforts to understand, anticipate, illuminate, isolate, and mitigate asymmetric threat networks and enable timely research that hastens the development of new capabilities for countering global asymmetric threats, their associated networks, and emerging technologies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

DTRA enables DoD, the U.S. Government, and International Partners to counter and deter Weapons of Mass Destruction and Improvised Threat networks. The mission is embodied in three capability areas: understand the environment, threats, and vulnerabilities; control, defeat, disable, and dispose of WMD and asymmetric threats; and safeguard the force and manage consequences.

Activities within this project are driven by current and anticipated asymmetric threats. The applied research enables the understanding and shaping of new theories and development of new technologies in support of Combatant Commands and the DoD. The applied research will drive programmatic action to anticipate, illuminate, isolate, and mitigate asymmetric threats.

This project will investigate emerging threat technologies as well as developing analysis support tools that identify emergent capability requirements and associated gaps. It provides timely acquisition and delivery of solutions to address evolving threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

There is no change to the program element or project structure in the FY 2021 request.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Applied Research program element funds the application and advancement of basic scientific knowledge to develop novel materials, devices, systems, and methods supporting next generation concepts and technologies, to include advances in Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) surveillance, detection, defeat, prevention, nonproliferation, counterproliferation, consequence management, and treaty verification.

This Applied Research portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives and Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction established annually by DTRA, which directly support policy and planning guidance from the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader WMD threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances DTRA’s CWMD mission by balancing the following: invest in DTRA’s applied research capabilities and increase the CWMD technology base to maximize future pay-off; capitalize on opportunities to deliver innovative, cost-effective solutions to technical challenges that must be resolved prior to system-specific technology investigations and development; and ensure applied research efforts are directly aligned to the mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The Congressional reduction in FY 2020 is for unjustified growth. The decrease in FY 2021 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to the net impact of:
(1) the realignment of funds to PE 0603160BR for the CWMD Information Integration Cell (CIIC) to better reflect the nature of this activity,
(2) increased investment in nuclear weapons effects targeting, battlefield nuclear warfare, certification without underground testing,
(3) realignment of funds from PE 0602718BR to 0603160BR for full effects modeling and WMD survivability and consequence management, and
(4) increased investment in WMD counterforce activities to conduct testing of advanced diagnostics with Defence Research and Development Canada as part of a Coalition Warfare Program to advance CWMD planning tools.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following related areas:

1.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threats in support of U.S. capabilities that detect and interdict such threats; and locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, and accuracy to enhance Service and Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.

2.  RDT&amp;E to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to: determine technical capabilities needed to improve DoD contingency planning activities; improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; and improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear detonation.

3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under DoD  Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.

4.  Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will be accomplished through expanded interpretability of test results, improvement in quality of ground samples, including complex debris from transient environments, and optimization of current debris analysis constructs.
- Evaluate and extract relevant data from historic nuclear tests to help calibrate codes to support device characterization improvements.
- Expand signature databases with appropriate information on generic designs, known weapon designs, and known effects.
- Increase capability development efforts in ubiquitous networks and airborne platforms to support prompt diagnostics and forensics technology improvements.
- Conduct/lead a DoD and interagency end-to-end nuclear forensics process technology demonstration and evaluation of DTRA-developed technologies/methodologies to assess NTNF process improvements.
- Identify potential development of a new advanced capability in forensic conclusion confidence, timeliness, and accuracy, and assist in assessing contribution to interagency attribution process and decisions.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, DTRA consolidated RM-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Counterforce Technologies into RG-Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.

1.  Defeat Technologies develops innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon technologies to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat adversarial use of WMD, while minimizing collateral effects. Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of WMD threat materials, an adversary's ability to deliver the same, and the physical and nonphysical support networks enabling both. It does so through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes and selecting technologies for integration into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, sub-scale test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next-generation CWMD capabilities. The project places a high priority on understanding, characterizing, and validating potential weapon effects within mathematical confidence as it relates to the unintended release of hazardous threat materials. Technologies with the potential for weapon and capability integration are transitioned to Budget Activity (BA) 3, Advanced Technology Development (ATD) efforts. On a limited basis, technology test data is shared with coalition partners.

2.  WMD counterforce technologies research develops weapons effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Technical Reachback cell. These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools. Energetics research develops materials and weapon design technology providing defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are beyond current high explosive blast/fragmentation warhead technology.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Efforts in this project include system vulnerability assessment, experimental capabilities, nuclear technology analysis, and human survivability.

The Nuclear Survivability project develops innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is designated by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design.  This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental Capabilities activities provide the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and EMP test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. This effort leverages research from and coordinates with the National Nuclear Security Administration (United States) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment (United Kingdom) to develop enabling technologies for improved nuclear weapon effects experimentation capabilities. Nuclear technology analysis efforts support detailed planning related to policy, strategy, objectives, and programmatic integration. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The WMD Counterforce Technologies Project develops Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) weapon effects modeling algorithms, full and sub-scale test series required to investigate CWMD weapon effects and sensor performance, and visualization and situational awareness tools to support the next generation Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) technical reachback cell.  These activities are critical enablers for the development of advanced CWMD planning tools and include Advanced Energetics and Advanced Life Sciences.  Advanced Energetics develops energetic materials and weapon design technology providing advanced defeat capabilities for engaging hard and deeply buried targets that are well beyond current high explosive blast/fragmentation warhead technology.  Advanced Life Sciences research develops technologies to find, locate, mitigate, and defeat WMD using bio-organisms or components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering WMD Test and Evaluation project provides a unique national test capability for simulated WMD facilities and processes. This capability provides structured and systematic end-to-end test event planning, preparation, management, execution, and data analysis. It also offers test instrumentation (data acquisition systems and optics), scientific analysis and predictions, test article construction, test article/test bed remediation, tunnel mining, architectural and engineering design, systems engineering and integration, and test data management. The project leverages 50 years of expertise in investigating weapons effects and target response across the spectrum of hostile environments that could be created by proliferant nations or terrorist organizations with access to advanced conventional weapons or WMD. Subject matter experts design full and sub-scale testing strategies focusing on weapon-target interaction with fixed soft and hardened facilities to include above ground facilities, cut-and-cover facilities, and deep underground tunnels. This capability does not exist anywhere else within the DoD and supports the counterproliferation pillar of the National Strategy to Counter WMD.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The decrease in FY 2021 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to:

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Technology Development portfolio is aligned with strategic planning objectives as well as with Science and Technology (S&amp;T) investment direction established annually by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The objectives directly support policy and planning guidance from the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the broader Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threat reduction community.

The portfolio advances the Countering WMD (CWMD) mission by selecting advanced technology development initiatives that meet the following criteria: (1) efforts are clearly defined and directly linked to mission-specific capability requirements of DTRA, the Military Departments, Combatant Commanders, other DoD and federal agencies, and international partners; (2) preliminary assessments of subsystems and components offer the highest potential for technological feasibility, operability, and producibility upon transition out of S&amp;T research; (3) activities demonstrate cost effectiveness or cost reduction potential of technologies during field testing or simulation at scale.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:SummaryExplanation>The Congressional reduction in FY 2020 is for excess and unjustified growth.  The increase in FY 2021 from the previous President's Budget submission is due to increased investment in WMD counterterrorism activities including the improvement of Combatant Commanders' offensive capabilities for render safe, pathway defeat, critical infrastructure defeat, and improved CWMD Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (JIPOE) and Preparation of the Environment (PE) capabilities.  This increase also supports efforts to develop, integrate, demonstrate, and transition CWMD advanced sensors, surveillance, and defeat planning technologies in support of the warfighter.  DTRA intends to increase research and development in CWMD target assessment technologies including tools for the characterization of CWMD targets across all Combatant Commands. Additionally, DTRA realigned of the CWMD situational awareness for the CWMD Information Integration Cell (CIIC) from program element 0602718BR to better reflect the nature of this activity.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, DTRA consolidated projects RF-Forensics Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, and RL- Nuclear and Radiological Effects in program element 0603160BR, into the renamed project RD-Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development. There are no changes to the program element or project structure in the FY 2021 request.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>1.  Research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to identify, develop, and exploit signatures associated with nuclear threats in support of U.S. capabilities that detect and interdict such threats; and locate, identify, and track special nuclear material and improve detection factors such as range, time, sensitivity, and accuracy to enhance Service and Special Mission Unit capabilities. These efforts support Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for countering terrorism, counterproliferation, nonproliferation, countering rogue states, and homeland defense.

2.  RDT&amp;E to systematically study signatures associated with adversary nuclear programs and nuclear detonations to gain knowledge or understanding necessary to: determine technical capabilities needed to improve DoD contingency planning activities; improve DoD situational awareness on the nuclear battlefield; and improve capabilities to attribute the source of a nuclear detonation.

3.  Research and develop innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under DoD Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Survivability Policy. System vulnerability research develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control System, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. Experimental capabilities research provides the warfighter with unique x-ray, gamma ray, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test capabilities in support of system survivability development, certification, and sustainment. These efforts also support international collaboration, user groups, case study reviews, and the Joint Atomic Information Exchange Group. The human survivability effort conducts research to develop and validate mortality and morbidity models associated with radiological and nuclear weapon effects.

4  Research and development modeling tools to support military operational planning, weapons effects predictions, and strategic system design decisions; consolidate validated modeling tools for integrated functionality; predict system responses to nuclear and radiological weapons producing electromagnetic, thermal, blast, shock, and radiation environments; provide detailed adversary nuclear infrastructure characterization to enhance counterforce operations and hazard effects; and, develop foreign nuclear weapon outputs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Counter-Terrorism Technologies project develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats. This project supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two research areas: (1) Countering WMD-Terrorism (CWMD-T) Counterproliferation Research and Development, which is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development/ acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; and (2) USSOCOM CWMD-T Support, which develops concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize operations and activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander, USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

- Continue development of WMD and pathway defeat technologies, as well as threat-specific test articles and analyses necessary to support the modeling archive used to support such developmental efforts.
- Continue to develop lighter, smaller, more effective breaching capabilities.
- Continue to develop next generation WMD detection technology applications.
- Deploy Analyzer for Wide-Area Restoration Effectiveness (AWARE) V1.0 in Dynamic Picture of the Operating Environment (DPOE) 4.0, the next generation of DPOE that will incorporate research advances in High Performance Computing (HPC), analytics, and natural language processing.  AWARE v1.0 will improve users' ability to identify emerging threat entities with existing personnel resources and reduce missed opportunities.
- Integrate HPC software tools into DPOE, leveraging capabilities of high performance computing to improve automated analytics to more accurately or quickly identify events, actors and threats.</r2:Text>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Forensics Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, and demonstrates post-detonation nuclear forensics systems providing accurate, rapid, and reliable means to collect, analyze, and evaluate prompt data and debris from a nuclear or radiological event in support of exploitation and attribution efforts. These forensic capabilities enable the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and its trusted partners to detect, locate, identify, track, and interdict nuclear and radiological threats, including weapons and material, and enablers to their acquisition and development. In accordance with DoD Directive S-2060.04, DTRA serves as the U.S.

Government lead for post-detonation National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) research and development (R&amp;D). As the central NTNF R&amp;D coordinator, DTRA works in consultation with interagency partners to develop and improve ground-based capabilities supporting exploitation and attribution missions. NTNF R&amp;D supports advanced research in the following areas: (1) Prompt nuclear effects exploitation for attribution; (2) nuclear device characterization for forensics; and (3) nuclear forensic materials exploitation for attribution.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Counter WMD Technologies and Capabilities Development encompasses the following areas.

1.  Defeat Technologies develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative kinetic and non-kinetic weapon capabilities to expand traditional and asymmetric options available to Combatant Commanders to deny, disrupt, and defeat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) while minimizing collateral effects.

2.  Technology development focuses on the physical or functional defeat of (1) chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological threat materials, (2) an adversary's ability to deliver the same, as well as (3) the physical and non-physical support networks enabling both. This program achieves these goals through the systematic identification and maturation of technologies capable of defeating WMD agents or agent-based processes, then integrating them into weapons, delivery systems, or rapid WMD elimination capabilities. This effort includes developing specific WMD agent/agent-based process simulants, test infrastructure, and sampling capability required for effective development, testing, and evaluation of next generation capabilities to ensure optimum weapon solutions are achieved. Requirements are delineated in Agency Priority Lists for lethal and non-lethal Countering WMD (CWMD) capability. Based on specified requirements, weapons and capabilities are transitioned to a Service program of record for system acquisition.

3.  Counter-terrorism technologies research develops and transitions a full spectrum of new technologies to counter emergent WMD threats. This research supports the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in two areas: (1) counter proliferation research is a collaborative effort to develop advanced, warfighter-unique technologies to defeat terrorist WMD development and acquisition pathways, to include defeat of the devices themselves, while minimizing risks to U.S. forces; and (2) counterterrorism concepts and technologies to integrate and synchronize activities that prevent terrorists and rogue nation states from developing, acquiring, proliferating, or using WMD. This effort supports Commander, USSOCOM responsibilities under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Unified Command Plan.

4.  Counterforce technologies research develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions capabilities to find, characterize, assess, and plan for the defeat of WMD threats. This research is focused in three areas: (1) WMD battlespace awareness provides warfighters with tools to find, characterize, and assess WMD threats; (2) weapons effects research provides modernized, fast-running, validated CWMD planning tools and integrates modeling and simulation software to optimize the execution of WMD and associated hard target defeat operations; and (3) innovative engineering of select promising technologies discovered under fundamental and basic research to increase the effectiveness of weapons against blast doors and other underground structures for functional defeat of Underground Facilities (UGFs), WMD, and their delivery systems.

5.  DTRA provides a unique national test bed capability for simulated weapons of mass destruction (WMD) facility characterization, weapon-target interaction, and WMD facility defeat testing. This test bed is capable of responding to operational needs outside of DTRA’s research portfolio and is used by the DoD, Military Services, Combatant Commanders, and other Federal Agencies to evaluate the implications of WMD, conventional weapons, and other special weapons used against U.S. military or civilian systems and targets.

6.	Target assessment technologies research develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of WMD target assessment, automated advanced targeting development (A2TD), facility defeat, and full dimensional defeat. This research develops analytical tools and processes required to: (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs); and (2) assess the results of physical and functional defeat mechanisms (such as direct attack). The A2TD initiative seeks to apply emerging computer assisted technologies to automate target characterization for hard targets and WMD targets. The end result will be faster and more efficient characterization of important hard targets and WMD targets. The facility defeat project develops, validates and employs processes and software for characterization and defeat of command specified hard targets in conjunction with DIA analysis. The full dimensional defeat project aims to develop an enterprise capability for finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts. The dynamic capabilities encompassed in this effort provide Combatant Commands and the intelligence community tools and processes needed to hold at risk high value hard targets and WMD targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Nuclear Survivability project develops, integrates, demonstrates, and transitions innovative technologies for the protection of mission-essential personnel, critical military and national defense capabilities, and associated control and support systems during a nuclear event. Research under this project supports the mission critical systems identified under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 3150.09, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability Policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is the DoD-designated center of excellence for electromagnetic pulse survivability assessments. The System Vulnerability and Assessment effort develops nuclear assessment capabilities to support operational planning, weapon effects predictions, and strategic system design. This activity also provides the DoD’s nuclear design and protection standards for new and existing systems, e.g., command and control facilities and aircraft. Key systems include the Nuclear Command and Control system, the net-centric thin-line, and both military and civilian satellites and associated support systems. The radiation-hardened nano-electronics effort develops and integrates radiation-hardened, high-performance prototype nano-electronics to meet DoD space and strategic deterrence system requirements.  The Human Survivability effort supports the Nuclear Test Personnel Review Program (NTPR), confirming the participation of Atomic Veterans in nuclear testing and radiological events and providing radiation dose assessments. The NTPR is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Justice for radiogenic disease compensation programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Target Assessment Technologies project develops, integrates, tests, demonstrates, and transitions processes and technologies providing advanced capabilities in the areas of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) target assessment and functional defeat.  The functional defeat process includes finding and identifying a facility, characterizing its function and physical layout, determining current or future vulnerabilities to available defeat mechanisms, planning and executing an attack, assessing damage, and denying reconstitution efforts.  Applying these processes to time-dependent constraints related to WMD target characterization and threat analysis presents a further technical challenge.  This project develops analytical tools and processes required to (1) find and characterize WMD targets and associated hard and deeply buried targets (HDBTs) and (2) to assess in real time the results of physical and functional defeat operations (such as a direct attack).  These novel, dynamic capabilities enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) and the intelligence community (IC) to hold at risk high value targets possessed by adversaries.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

improvised threats, threat networks and actors, command and control, operations, intelligence, and engagement for neutralizing, attacking, and defeating both current and emerging improvised threats and threat networks.

DTRA’s MIT capability, with its embedded Combatant Command (CCMD) capability, data integrators, and reachback staff work continuously to create capabilities requested by users from the DoD, the Intelligence Community (IC), interagency partners, and the Whole of Government to ingest, fuse, analyze, and present mission relevant data and information. These capabilities reside in Catapult, a cloud technology-based data analytics platform developed and being delivered by DTRA that provides an extensible, continuously augmented, real-time repository of intelligence on improvised threats, including IEDs, and worldwide threat actors and networks. Catapult is fully operational and accredited on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). The Catapult architecture pulls from more than 850 data sources on SIPRNet and more than 170 data sources on JWICS. Catapult uses a set of more than 100 tools (ANTS) and services to provide national-level capabilities for data and information capture, discovery, access, aggregation, correlation, visualization, analysis, sharing, and distribution for users from the strategic level to the tactical edge.

In addition to Catapult, the DTRA MIT created and deployed a significant capability called Voltron. Voltron provides analysts access to signals intelligence (SIGINT) data within a secure and IC-accredited software developer environment. Voltron provides users a single interface to query more than 25 data sources and combines results into dynamic visualizations and exports. Voltron captures analytics techniques and provides a constantly growing toolbox providing analysts with continuously new models in support of analysis and operations. Voltron provides analysts access to methodologies involving multi-INT fusion in an easy to use interface. These methods are based on years of experience supporting the tactical targeting environment and built in collaboration with other teams across the IC. There are currently more than 75 models in Voltron available to the user community.

DTRA's authorities and mission have enabled a unique, Secure Development Operations (DevSecOps) “Path-to-Production” to rapidly develop and deploy mission- driven IT solutions. This unique development environment includes an integrated Cyber Security Assessment and Authorization process, an in-house collateral Authorizing Official for SIPRNet and DIA-approved Authorization to Operate on JWICS, creating a strong partnership between technologists and intelligence analysts working real-world problems, and a collaborative and innovative culture that launches practical software solutions rapidly.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>In an October 29, 2018 memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the transfer of Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) program management responsibilities from the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), in light of DTRA’s role in conducting Joint Mission Assurance Assessments. Prior to FY 2020, funding for MARMS is captured in program element 0605170D8Z; beginning in FY 2021 funding for MARMS is captured in a newly established program element, 0605141BR.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mission Assurance Risk Management System (MARMS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) risk management system that directly supports the Secretary of Defense's Mission Assurance (MA) responsibilities as defined in the DoD Directive (DoDD) 3020.40, Mission Assurance, with the objectives of creating resilience and supporting critical processes to enable the protection of assets and ensuring defense critical missions. MARMS will function as an integration framework spanning multiple security domains that will support risk-informed decision-making, resource investment, and improved synchronization at different levels within DoD. MARMS supports multiple Joint Capability Areas (JCA): Command and Control, Logistics, and Protection. MARMS is an acquisition category (ACAT) Ill software program and has a "high" impact value for each of the three security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01 and the Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2020, DTRA consolidated projects RF-Forensics Technologies, RI-Nuclear Survivability, and RL-Nuclear and Radiological Effects in program element 0602718BR, into the renamed project RD-Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and to model the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons and integrate these capabilities for Combatant Command use.

DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations and a radionuclide analysis laboratory comprising the majority of the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This system delivers data continuously to the U.S. monitoring and verification community supporting warfighter and interagency nuclear-event response. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.

The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to countering WMD. Technical assessments are made against nuclear treaty implementation and nuclear event response requirements to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide U.S. IMS data, and to access international IMS data required to support U.S. monitoring policy, decision- makers, and negotiation teams. This project will improve the efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of U.S. IMS stations; optimize IMS capabilities to support both nuclear treaty monitoring and nuclear-event response; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of nuclear events.

The Nuclear Capabilities Services (NuCS) project performs RDT&amp;E to improve capabilities to model nuclear weapon effects (NWE) environments and simulate the response of systems and networks to these effects. The Enhanced Consequence Analysis (ECA) project integrates NuCS capabilities and integrates these modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities with operational databases and systems. Together, these programs support U.S. and allied planning and decision making in the event of nuclear weapon use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectNote>Beginning in FY 2020, efforts in this project are captured under project RD-Nuclear Technologies and Capabilities Development.</r2:ProjectNote>
                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the development of verification and monitoring capabilities for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to counter proliferation and weapons of mass destruction (WMD). DTRA’s Nuclear Arms Control Technologies (NACT) program performs Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to improve the sustainability, reliability, and effectiveness of capabilities related to its operational mission to install, operate, maintain, and sustain the waveform and radionuclide nuclear detonation detection stations comprising the U.S. portion of the International Monitoring System (IMS). This delivers data to the U.S. monitoring and verification community and enables U.S. compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in support of U.S. and Department of Defense (DoD) nonproliferation objectives.
  
The project addresses WMD monitoring, implementation of, and compliance with arms control agreement requirements validated by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment. This project conforms to the administration’s research and development priorities related to WMD arms control and disablement. Technical assessments are made against CTBT implementation requirements and U.S. objectives to provide the basis for sound project development, evaluate existing programs, provide data required to inform compliance assessments, and support U.S. monitoring policy, decision-makers, and negotiation teams.
 
The primary RDT&amp;E program emphasis is on improvements that enable the installation of treaty-specific stations, which reduce costs and increase the reliability in diverse and often harsh environments; improve efficiency, performance, reliability, and sustainability of existing stations and treaty-specified verification capabilities; and improve capabilities to detect, characterize, and enable discrimination of, nuclear weapons tests. The NACT program directly supports U.S. and allied warfighter and national technical monitoring requirements and provides vital data used by the treaty monitoring community, warfighter planners, DoD, other U.S. Government agencies, and international agencies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Nuclear and Radiological Effects project develops, integrates, and transitions nuclear and radiological assessment modeling tools for use in military planning processes. The assessment modeling tools provide critical analytics for Consequence of Execution (COE) considerations during nuclear targeting and post-detonation nuclear response, supporting interagency strategic and tactical decision making. These COE considerations can include the full range of political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information (PMESII) factors and their interaction, extending analytical capabilities beyond common damage assessment practices and into second and third order effects. These activities/efforts support Combatant Commands and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations by providing accurate and reliable consequence assessment and response information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

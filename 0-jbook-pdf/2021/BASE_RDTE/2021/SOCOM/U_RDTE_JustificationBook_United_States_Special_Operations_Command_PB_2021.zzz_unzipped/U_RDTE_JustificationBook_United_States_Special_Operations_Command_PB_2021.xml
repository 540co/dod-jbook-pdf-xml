                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding:  

FY 2019:  Decrease of $1.286 million is due to transfer of funds to Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs.   

FY 2020:  Decrease of $3.000 million is due to a Congressional directed reduction due to underexecution.

FY 2021:  Decrease of $4.210 million is due to a comprehensive analysis of future capability by USSOCOM resulting in a reduction of technology concept demonstrations, prototyping, and evaluation of advanced capabilities to better align with the Department's priorities as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (-$4.210 million).

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Advanced Technology Development (project S200) conducts rapid prototyping and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  ATDs provide a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by Special Operations Forces (SOF) users.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  ATDs also address projects that are a result of unique joint special mission or area-specific needs for which a few-of-a-kind prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.  

Engineering Analysis (project SF101) provides rapid response capability for the investigation, evaluation, and demonstration of technologies for SOF platform (ground, air, and maritime) and soldier system-unique requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: sensor integration; enhanced situational awareness; near-real-time intelligence to include data fusion, threat detection and avoidance; electronic support measures for threat geo-location and specific emitter identification; navigation; target detection; weapon performance integration; and future SOF platform and soldier system requirements.  Provides additional engineering analysis and testing required to transition items from national forces to theater forces.

Information and Broadcast Systems Advanced Technology (project S225) conducts rapid prototyping, advanced technology demonstrations, and advanced concept technology demonstrations of information and broadcast systems technology.  Includes planning, analyzing, evaluating, and production information systems capabilities and distribution/dissemination broadcast systems capabilities.  It provides a means for demonstrating and evaluating the utility of emerging/advanced technologies in as realistic an operational environment as possible by SOF users.  This project also integrates efforts with each other and conducts technology demonstrations in conjunction with joint experiments and other assessment events.  Evaluation results are included in a transition package, which assists in the initiation of or insertion into an acquisition program.  The project also addresses unique, joint special mission or area-specific needs for which prototypes must be developed on a rapid response basis, or are of sufficient time sensitivity to accelerate the prototyping effort of a normal acquisition program in any phase.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding: 
FY 2019:  None.

FY 2020:  None.

FY 2021:  Net decrease of $0.421 million is due to rebaseline of funding to continue rapid integration and user testing of emerging standards and technology in the Integrated Survey Program (ISP) (-$0.380 million).

For the Defense Wide Review (DWR), USSOCOM performed a comprehensive analysis of future capabilities and is streamlining contract support costs as a result of better buying power initiatives which aligns with the Department's priorities as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (-$0.041 million).

Schedule:  Market research results and the pivot to the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Fusion Analysis and Development Effort (FADE) platform modifies technology development objectives and timelines.  Modernization efforts with SGIP and SOF SIGINT PED modify technology development objectives and timelines.
  
Technical:  Usability testing and requirements refinement led to market research and technology shifts across DCGS-SOF.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>DCGS-SOF leverages SOF programs, DoD and Intelligence Community partners, National labs, and other Government Agencies to integrate Commercial Off The Shelf/Government Off The Shelf (COTS/GOTS), and other mature technologies into the Program of Record which will reside partially within the SOF Information Enterprise combined with Web-Client tools in a global cloud. These alliances enable more agile access to (searchable, discoverable) and sharing of larger data domains and services to meet SOF-peculiar documented requirements. The technology allows for seamless integration and federation with DoD, Interagency, and Coalition tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) PED systems.  The DCGS-SOF program office employs an agile development process with capability insertions into the development baseline for assessment and future deployment into the operational baseline.  All development requirements are prioritized through the DCGS Requirements Working Group (DRWG) chaired by J2.  Once approved, the requirements are evaluated and scheduled by engineering development teams.  Using this methodology allows capabilities to be inserted in a fast and agile manner based on user requirements and priorities.  All Evolutionary Technology Insertions (ETIs) in the R-4 schedule are based on current program office projections.  If requirements change based on the DRWG, the ETI and version capabilities identified may change.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element identifies, develops, rapidly prototypes, integrates, and tests Special Operations Forces (SOF) - peculiar mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Ground Control Stations (GCSs), and training systems as a component of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Tactical (MALET) program.  USSOCOM is designated as the DoD lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks.  USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This program element addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition, and Strike.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the supported combatant command in global operations, USSOCOM requires the capability to find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze time-sensitive high-value targets.  These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves.  This project addresses the primary areas of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target (ISR&amp;T) Acquisition and Strike.  The majority of the developmental funds provides for the Operational Flight Software (OFP) for the aircraft, Ground Control Station, and Turret.  SOF peculiar modifications to the OFP allow for a rapid integration of emerging capabilities in order to maintain relevance and dominance of the MQ-9 in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element consists of a highly competitive three-phase award system that provides qualified small businesses with the opportunity to propose high quality innovative ideas that meet specific research and development needs of USSOCOM.  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is a result of the Small Business Development Act of 1992.  It was enacted by Congress in Public Law 97-219, reenacted by Public Law 99-443, and reauthorized by the SBIR Program Reauthorization Act of 2012.  Starting in FY 1994, the SBIR program was refocused toward dual use and defense reinvestment efforts.  Phase I projects evaluate the scientific merit and feasibility of an idea.  Phase II projects expand the results of, and further pursue, the developments of Phase I.  Phase III commercializes the results of Phase II and requires the use of private or non-SBIR federal funding.  USSOCOM participates annually in the DOD Request for Proposal process.  USSOCOM then awards its proposed SBIR projects.  FY 2014 was the first year USSOCOM participated in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program.  The STTR goal is similar to the SBIR program, but the STTR program additionally seeks to expand public/private sector partnerships between small business and nonprofit U.S. research institutions.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>SF100 Aviation Systems Advanced Development:
This project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique aviation and training requirements. Timely application of SOF-unique technology is critical and necessary to meet requirements in such areas as: SOF common avionics; SOF Common Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) radar, best known as Silent Knight Radar (SKR) or AN/APQ-187; Defensive Countermeasures; Electronic Warfare (EW) - Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM); Precision Strike Package (PSP); PSP High Energy Laser; AC-130H/W/U and MC-130E/H/P Recapitalization, and other SOF airborne platforms; digital terrain elevation data and electronic order of battle; digital maps; Tactical Mission Networking (TMN), formerly known as Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN); near real-time Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); data fusion; threat detection and avoidance; navigation, target detection, and identification technologies; weapons integration; digital broadcast capabilities; aerial refueling; survivability; mission systems automation and ISR payload technological improvements with size, weight, power and integration onto all SOF unmanned aircraft system (UAS) ISR platforms.

SF200 CV-22 Development/Test and Evaluation:
The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration (infill), exfiltration (exfill), and resupply to SOF teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft.  The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, avionics, SOF communications, defensive/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.
CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA SKR provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas to infill, exfill, and resupply SOF forces. Provides more sustainable/capable replacement to obsolescing and technology limited TF/TA AN/APQ-174/186 Multi-Mode Radar (MMR). The Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS), in combination with the ramp-mounted gun, provides a ~360 degree field of fire to suppress/eliminate enemy targets.  The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the United States Marine Corps (USMC) MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.

SF300:  Armed Overwatch:
Armed Overwatch provides Special Operations Forces (SOF) deployable and sustainable aircraft systems fulfilling Close Air Support, Precision Strike, and SOF Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements in austere and permissive environments for the Countering-Violent Extremist Organizations mission.  Armed Overwatch missions include: Armed ISR, Strike Coordination &amp; Reconnaissance, and Airborne Forward Air Control.  The funding in this project supports development, integration, prototype demonstrations, testing of SOF-unique capabilities and Air Worthiness Release efforts.
												
S750 Mission Training and Preparation Systems:
The Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) project funds the definition, design, development, rapid prototyping, integration, and testing of SOMPE systems to support mission planning, rehearsal, and execution requirements to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies in current mission planning, rehearsal, and execution capabilities. The Mission Training and Preparation Systems project also includes program management, systems engineering, configuration management, architecture development, risk reduction, and trade study initiatives, as well as initiatives to assure interoperability and commonality between diverse mission planning, rehearsal, and execution systems. 

S875 AC/MC-130J:
The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the PSP to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Combat Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Combat Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft provide clandestine single or multi-ship low-level aerial refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; and conducts airdrops of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles, and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  Incremental upgrade and agile software delivery approaches will be used to rapidly prototype, integrate and mature SOF capabilities onto the aircraft.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to: Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated terrain following/terrain avoidance, electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) legacy C-130 fleet.

D615 Rotary Wing Aviation:
This project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique rotary wing aviation and training requirements. This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE), avionics, and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF in the multi-domain operations (MDO) environments and against near peer threats.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.

These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• EC-130J Upgrades:  Operational Flight Program (OFP) Block Cycle is being developed by the Air Force program office using existing development and production contracts.

• EC-130J Commando SOLO: This program is being transitioned into the Multi Mission Payload - Heavy (MMP-H) program, Warrior Systems, PE 1160431BB. MMP-H uses a traditional acquisition development and procurement strategy with accelerated development that includes increased flight test and multiple combat evaluations.

• EW – RFCM:   Scope current contract with BAE Systems to a B-Kit demonstration, and in parallel, execute three Other Transaction Authority (OTA) demonstrations with new industry partners for a best value decision and follow on award for remaining development effort in 3QFY20.

• PSP for SOF:  Incremental acquisition strategy to integrate and test the PSP and capability enhancements on donor MC-130J aircraft provided by the U.S. Air Force and other SOF aircraft.  Multiple contract awards.

• PSP HEL:  AC-130 HEL program utilizes Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Dahlgren Division as the government Lead System Integrator of HEL components.  HEL system components are either purchased under Defense Ordinance Technology Consortium OTA or developed and assembled by NSWC Dahlgren.  Both of these approaches provide flexibility for rapid prototyping.

• C-130 SOF Common TF/TA SKR:  Awarded delivery order on Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to integrate and test the SOF Common TF/TA SKR on MC-130J aircraft and develop modifications to aircraft displays and controls.

• MH-47/MH-60 SOF Common TF/TA SKR:  Continue software spiral development to improve the reliability and usability of the radar.   

• ISR Payload Sensor Technology:  Effort is being executed via a spiral development, integration and testing acquisition strategy based on leveraging existing sensor technology.  The focus will be on reducing the size, weight, power, and cost of state of the art ISR sensors fielded on larger ISR platforms, in order to make them usable by smaller SOF ISR platforms.  This development will include the integration of the ISR capability with the platform’s Command and Control and Communications systems as appropriate.

• Aviation Engineering Analysis: Utilize DoD Information Analysis Center sponsored by the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) to analyze aircraft survivability and recommend material solutions for demonstration and potential integration on Fixed Wing aircraft.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The CV-22 is a SOF variant of the Joint V-22 vertical medium lift, multi-mission aircraft. The CV-22 project provides long range, high speed, infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to SOF teams in hostile, denied, and politically sensitive areas. This is a capability not currently provided by other existing aircraft. The funding in this project supports integration, design, development, rapid prototyping, and test to provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, more robust performance in situational awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, weapons, SOF communications, avionics, defensive/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment and improved reliability and maintainability of the CV-22 platform.

CV-22 SOF Common Terrain Following Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Silent Knight Radar (SKR): Provides long-range, night/adverse weather, clandestine penetration of medium-to-high threat areas for infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of SOF forces. This more sustainable and capable radar replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 terrain following/avoidance radar currently integrated on CV-22 aircraft.

CV-22 Block 20 Systems: Design, integrate, test, and validate enhancements required to meet SOF-unique mission requirements and correct deficiencies identified in previous testing. This incremental development will provide improved capabilities to include, but not limited to, robust performance in situational awareness, ISR, weapons, SOF communications, avionics, defensive/survivability systems, maneuverability, mission deployment, improved reliability and maintainability of the CV platform.  Included within Block 20 is the Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS). FDWS provides the CV-22 with the capability to suppress threats in the forward hemisphere while the aircraft is in the critical phase of landing and takeoff at the mission objective. The FDWS integrates the fielded GAU-17 belly gun system currently employed on the United States Marine Corps MV-22 aircraft with the SOF peculiar Color Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) and cockpit firing controls for pilot operation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>When possible, rapid prototyping will be incorporated in the acquisition strategies below to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate residual operational capabilities.
The SKR was developed by USSOCOM to provide a SOF Common TF/TA capability for SOF aircraft. The SKR replaces the obsolescing APQ-186 TF/TA multimode radar on the CV-22. The acquisition strategy for the CV-22 SOF Common TF/TA SKR program is to procure radar units and radar software modifications through the USSOCOM SKR program management office, buy aircraft modification kits, and integrate SKR into CV-22 aircraft using a mixture of both sole source and competitive contracts.

The Block 20 Full-azimuth Defensive Weapon System (FDWS) will be based on modifications to the legacy Defensive Weapon System (DWS) currently fielded on USMC MV-22 aircraft and previously ground tested on a CV-22. These modifications will integrate the DWS with the CV-22 pilots color helmet mounted displays and cockpit controls to correct deficiencies/improve system effectiveness.  They will be awarded on a competitive EMD contract for development.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Description>Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution (SOMPE) develops, integrates, tests, and validates software enhancements required to meet SOF-unique requirements for, and correct deficiencies to, mission planning, preview, and execution software tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time-critical. The SOMPE project automates time-sensitive planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during mission execution. SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to integrate global operations including, but not limited to, precision strike software, digital navigation, and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) command and control. This project also provides the integration of SOMPE with multi-dimensional visualization systems, providing immersive mission rehearsal in minimal timeframes from the SOMPE mission plan. SOMPE is embedded in the USSOCOM Headquarters, Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC), Joint Special Operations Task Forces, Joint Special Operations Aviation Components, SOF warfighters, and SOF warfighter platforms.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AC/MC-130J project funds core SOF-unique modifications to replace aging/retired AC-130H Spectre, AC-130W Stinger II, AC-130U Spooky, MC-130E Combat Talon I, MC-130P Combat Shadow, MC-130H Combat Talon II aircraft.  The 8 AC-130H Spectre, 12 AC-130W Stinger II and 17 AC-130U Spooky airframes will be replaced with MC-130J aircraft modified with the Precision Strike Package (PSP) to achieve the AC-130J configuration.  The AC-130J aircraft will provide close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance capability.  The 14 MC-130E Talon I, 23 MC-130P Combat Shadow, and 20 MC-130H Talon II airframes will be replaced by MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications.  The MC-130J Commando II aircraft with SOF mission modifications provide clandestine single or multi-ship low-level aerial refueling for special operations helicopters and CV-22 aircraft; conduct airdrops of leaflets, small special operations teams, resupply bundles, and combat rubber raiding craft.  The Air Force procures and fields the basic aircraft, common support equipment, and trainers for USSOCOM.  Incremental upgrade and agile software development approaches will be used to integrate SOF capabilities onto the aircraft and training systems.  SOF capabilities include, but are not limited to: Airborne Mission Networking (AbMN), data fusion, threat detection and avoidance, integrated Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA), electronic warfare, and embedded training.  Integrating and automating SOF mission systems that deliver these capabilities is critical to fielding SOF-capable AC/MC-130J aircraft to recapitalize Air Force Special Operations Command’s legacy C-130 fleet.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ITMS program increases operational crew performance and aircraft survivability by integrating the MC-130J green aircraft and multiple SOF mission systems as an interoperable system-of-systems.  Automated software capabilities will be developed, integrated, and tested with SOF-peculiar and green aircraft flight information, displays, and controls through the Special Mission Systems (SMS) suite. By increasing system-of-systems data interoperability through an Open Mission Systems (OMS) compliant Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA), an agile software development infrastructure will be employed to integrate multiple subsystems and continuously deliver automated software capabilities. Capabilities include, but are not limited to; automated route replanning, tactical flight management, integrated aircraft defensive systems, defensive countermeasures, and embedded training. The NextGen Special Mission Processor (SMP) resolves current diminishing manufacturing sources issues with a MOSA compliant design to perform central processing for ITMS software.  ITMS enables dynamic operations with integrated real-time information, automation, and decision making data for safe TF/TA flight and mission execution (MC-130J aircraft) and seamless employment of the PSP (AC-130J aircraft).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>As a core strategy, rapid prototyping has been incorporated in the acquisition strategies below to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities.

MC-130J AbMN: Award sole source Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract to develop a battlespace information exchange system for the MC-130J consisting of Government/ Commercial-off-the-shelf communications and computing hardware and Government/developmental software.  This approach leverages portions of the AC-130J gunship infrastructure design applicable to the MC-130J. After completing developmental and operational flight testing, award a sole source contract for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) followed by a competitive Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract for production, aircraft integration, and fielding.

ITMS: Develop virtual environment to enable collaborative integration of modular software services procured through competitive, sole source contracts, and use of open mission system compliant standards for hardware and software architecture, software, services, and future subsystems.

The U.S. Air Force procures the basic AC-130J aircraft under the HC/MC-130J Recapitalization procurement program. USSOCOM will fund development, integration, and testing of capability enhancements for SOF-unique mission equipment using an incremental acquisition strategy.  Multiple contract awards.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for the development, rapid prototyping, demonstration, and integration of current and maturing technologies for Special Operations Forces (SOF)-unique rotary wing aviation and training requirements. This project includes modifications to Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) avionics and weapons systems to counter rapidly emerging threats, address cyber security, improve lethality and enhance aircraft self-protection in contested environments.  Rotary wing aircraft supported by this project include: MH-60M, MH-47G, and A/MH-6M. These aircraft provide aviation support to SOF in worldwide contingency operations and low-intensity conflicts. They must be capable of rapid deployment, undetected penetration of hostile areas, and operations at extended ranges under adverse weather conditions to infiltrate, provide logistics for, reinforce, and extract SOF.  The anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat is characterized by an extensive and sophisticated ground based air defense system and an upgraded air-to-air capability targeted against helicopters.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develops, integrates, and tests critical active and passive SOF-P aircraft survivability equipment to counter the acknowledged high proliferation of advanced surface-to-air threat systems for the A/MH-6, MH-60, and MH-47.  These threat systems are evolving technically at an unprecedented rate, requiring rapid countermeasure system development and immediate spiraled improvements that will reduce the probability of successful engagement, increase the probability of detecting and countering threat systems, and improve the aircraft's ability to continue operating after sustained battle damage.  This program includes development and testing of both new systems and Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I)/upgrades of fielded survivability equipment, and associated qualification testing.  P3I upgrades may include, but are not limited to, expansion of loadsets on existing systems, modernization of legacy components, and studies directed at potential "collaborative off-boarding/on-boarding" detect/countermeasure capabilities to provide expanded coverage for aircrews in a high threat environment.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>• A/MH-6M Block 3.0 Upgrade comprises three distinct efforts:  integrated airframe, Block 3 performance kits and avionics upgrades.  The airframe efforts (new rotor blades/flight control kits and new shells) will be a sole-source contract to Boeing, owner of the technical data associated with the A/MH-6 airframes.  The cockpit avionics architecture will be developed by Rockwell-Collins.  Any new hardware components will be Non Developmental Item/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) to the extent possible and will be competitively selected.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).

• MH-60M Modifications and Upgrades supports systems integration and qualification efforts on MH-60M helicopters.  The Mods and Upgrades are executed via various acquisition vehicles and includes, but are not limited to, government and contractor flight test support, engineering analysis, documentation, and airworthiness substantiation.  Airframe modification and integration work will be conducted via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).

• DVE integrates and qualifies a solution to address a safety of flight issue while flying in DVE.  A competitive source selection process was conducted, resulting in down-selection of one vendor for the DVE solution which will procure, integrate, and install components to provide real-time “see through” imagery and visual cues for obstacle avoidance and landing zone information during all phases of flight.  

• FVL is the SOF aviation participation in the Joint FVL effort to develop the next generation of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and establishes the foundation for the transformation of DOD vertical lift aviation capabilities over the next forty years. 

• IRCM integrates a mission configurable Missile Warning System and IRCM capability at a weight suitable for the A/MH-6 aircraft.  Procurement of systems for integration and test will leverage Department of Navy IRCM development efforts and contracts.  The government will integrate the systems onto the A/MH-6 utilizing existing aircraft modification contracts.  Will begin evaluation and qualification of an infrared exhaust suppressor for the A/MH-6M aircraft, and continue flare testing for emerging threats.  

• MH-47 Modifications and Upgrades will develop technologies to improve performance and safety of the MH-47G and decrease operational costs.  Efforts include the APAS.  The upgrades and modifications are executed via various acquisition vehicles and consist mostly of government and contractor executed integration, testing, and qualification efforts with some analytical engineering services to be completed. Post-production block modifications are accomplished via a contract with the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).

• MPU provides for future cockpit architecture studies that will help define the replacement of current mission and video processors for all ARSOA platforms.  Additionally it will address near term required upgrades to existing components.  Potential upgrades will be through existing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), while the future cockpit architecture studies will be competitively awarded.

• Tactical (Airborne) Mission Networking provides for future communications and networking capability exploration and solution development that will ensure ARSOA platforms can communicate through voice and data in a highly contested and congested RF environment. Additionally, it will ensure ARSOA aircraft can maintain interoperability with the SOF and conventional ground forces’ plan of rapidly and continually updating their communications and networking infrastructure.  Non-developmental communication equipment will be procured through existing DOD contracts.  Aircraft integration will be through existing aircraft modification contracts.

• ASE RFCM Upgrades develops and tests both new systems and pre-planned product improvements/upgrades of fielded aircraft survivability systems and countermeasures.   For new systems, other services’ development and testing contracts are leveraged to the maximum extent possible.  Upgrades of fielded equipment are typically accomplished by the OEM.

• IRES integrates non-developmental multi-spectral electro-optical sensor systems (EOSS) onto SOF Rotary Wing aircraft to address legacy system obsolescence, reduce aircraft weight, and provide improved system performance.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) that provides for the identification, development, rapid prototyping and testing of Special Operations Forces (SOF) intelligence equipment to identify and eliminate deficiencies in providing timely intelligence to deployed forces. Sub-projects address the primary areas of intelligence dissemination, sensor systems, tagging, tracking, and locating devices, integrated threat warning to SOF mission platforms, biometrics and forensic site exploitation and tactical exploitation of national system capabilities. USSOCOM has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities into the 21st century. USSOCOM's C4I systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and timely exchange of intelligence and threat warning to all organizational echelons. The C4I systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration with the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This program provides research and development, and rapid prototyping to support HQ SOCOM TENCAP program and supporting capabilities. NSSS improves the combat effectiveness of USSOCOM, its components, and the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) by providing innovative space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies and system enhancements, products, and special communications capabilities to tactical SOF units.  NSSS leverages current and developmental National systems to integrate with, augment, and support SOCOM systems.  Focus areas include Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Special Communications, and intelligence fusion, reporting, and dissemination.  NSSS efforts are characterized by rapid prototype development to transition to SOCOM Programs of Record.  These developmental efforts support SOCOM’s existing MIPs.  NSSS will also improve SIGINT capabilities by pursuing Joint Interface Control Document 4.x and follow-on compliant SIGINT capabilities, extending SOCOM’s cross-domain security infrastructure by adding unclassified sensors into theater net-centric geo-location architecture, improving detection of Low-Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI-LPD) signals, and automating radar characterizations that enhance tactical SOF capabilities to find, fix, monitor, and target assets using National Technical Means in support of tactical operators.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for development, rapid prototyping, testing, and integration of specialized equipment in the areas of automation, communication, radio, weapon, soldier protection and survival, visual augmentation, lasers and sensors, munition and Military Information Support Operations (MISO) systems.  Warrior Systems specialized equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Special Operation Forces (SOF) must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces.  The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.  The efforts within this Program Element (PE) improve SOF warfighting capabilities by continuing efforts to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust capabilities.  The SOF mission mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability while, generally, being conducted in harsh environments for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.  Communications efforts will maintain a Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams, and provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies and allied foreign forces.  Efforts relating to soldier protection and survival requirements will improve survivability and mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) efforts rely on cutting edge detection sensors, both passive and active, paired with kinetic and non-kinetic defeat systems will allow SOF Operators to conduct Special Forces missions in denied and hostile environments worldwide.  Specialized visual augmentation, lasers and sensors will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict.  Munition efforts include advanced engineering operational system development and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar munitions and equipment.  Precision Strike Systems (PSS) will develop a SOF organic strike mission package to surgically strike an agile and mobile enemy, protect own forces, and minimize collateral damage.  Additionally, MISO efforts include planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups and individuals.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.  This R-1 PE received Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in FY 2019 and FY 2020.  FY 2021 funding includes OCO funding for Enduring Requirements ($5.796 million).  

MISO:
This project provides for the development, test and integration of MISO equipment.  MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately, the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.  This project funds transformational systems and equipment to conduct the seven phase MISO process (planning, targeting audience analysis, series development, product development and design, approval, production/distribution/dissemination, and measures of effectiveness) in support of combatant commanders.

Weapons Systems:
This project provides for next generation system development and Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I), testing, and integration of specialized weapon systems and weapon accessories to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  Efforts include muzzle brakes and suppressors, and P3I for assault, sniper, and crew served weapons leveraging the latest technological advances to achieve overmatch capability against emerging threats.

Soldier Protection and Survival Systems:
This project funds development, testing, integration, rapid prototyping and evaluation of specialized equipment to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF), to include, but not limited to, individual survival equipment, hearing protection, clothing systems, load bearing equipment, Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RC-IED) systems, Counter Unmanned Systems (aerial, ground and maritime), and personnel safety equipment to improve the mobility of SOF, while conducting varied missions. These missions are generally conducted in harsh and hostile environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy.

Body Armor and Associated Equipment:
This project provides specialized equipment with ballistic protection to meet the unique soldier protection and survival requirements of SOF.  Specialized ballistic equipment improves survivability and load bearing equipment impacting the mobility of SOF while conducting varied missions.  This project enhances the SOF Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements program by providing for the research, development, and testing of body armor plates, soft armor, helmets, eye protection, and other personal protective equipment to meet current ballistic threats that exist on the battlefield.

Visual Augmentation, Lasers and Sensor Systems:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized visual augmentation, laser and sensor systems equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF and facilitate future Hyper-Enabled Operator capabilities.  Programs in this area include binocular/monocular devices; next generation laser designation and geo-location systems; weapon aiming lasers, scopes and accessories; and training and simulation systems.

Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems:
This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support SOF.  SOF units require communications equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  SOF Communications Equipment and Electronics is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.

Tactical Systems Development:
This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of SOF. Tactical systems provide forward deployed forces with advanced networking, automated data processing, storage, and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and Command and Control (C2) of forces. 

Tactical Radio Systems:
This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  SOF units require radio communication equipment that improves their warfighting capability without degrading their mobility.  United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has developed an overall strategy to ensure that Tactical Radio Systems continue to provide SOF with the required capabilities throughout the 21st century.  SOF Tactical Radios provide the critical C3 link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams involved in operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied/coalition forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed C2 communications between infiltrated/operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.

Munitions Advanced Development:
This project provides for the advanced engineering, operational system development, and qualification efforts related to SOF-peculiar and Foreign/Non-standard munitions and equipment.  Funding supports development of Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology and evaluation, in accordance with statutory requirement set forth in U.S. Code, Title 10, Chapter 141, Section 2389 (December 2001).  Testing is in accordance with the USSOCOM IM Strategic Plan.  Funding also supports efforts to develop and improve Precision Strike Systems (PSS) and Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM), including the development and integration of improved warheads, seekers, guidance navigation and control systems, operational flight software, and missile delivery on to SOF platforms. When appropriate, these technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping to develop, demonstrate and evaluate residual operational capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Funding: 

FY 2019:  Net decrease of $0.332 million is due to a transfer to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs (-$2.274 million); an increase in MMP to cover additional requirements related to Advanced Sniper Rifle development ($1.137 million); an increase for continued RC-IED systems engineering, test and evaluation ($0.990 million); and funding was made available to support critical emerging Command requirements during the year of execution (-$0.185 million).

FY 2020:  Net increase of $13.182 million is due to Congressional Add program increases for distribute audio media and next generation loudspeakers ($4.000 million), Small Glide Munition (SGM) unmanned aerial system integration ($3.000 million), SGM collaborative strike environment ($10.000 million) and Congressional General Reduction for prior year carryover (-$3.818 million).

FY 2021:  Net increase of $9.970 million due to an increase for the initiation of developmental, test and evaluation of new Media Production Center (MPC) ($2.694 million), begin the engineering and integration for the munitions guidance and control upgrades for Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM) ($3.155 million), rapid development of a modular open systems architecture to provide Mission Command Common Operational Picture (MC/COP) ($4.583 million), and funding was made available to support critical emerging command requirements (-$0.180 million).  Funding transfer from (-$5.796 million) base to OCO for Enduring Requirements ($5.796 million). 

For the Defense Wide Review (DWR), USSOCOM performed a comprehensive analysis of future capabilities and is streamlining the RC-CIED, Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS), and Munitions Advanced Development project contract support efforts to better align with the Department's priorities as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (-$0.282 million).
-$0.058 million - RC-CIED - reduces system engineering and test and evaluation efforts.
-$0.204 million - C-UAS - reduces development and test of various capabilities.
-$0.020 million - Munitions Advanced Development - reduces IM testing on various munitions.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for communication systems to meet emergent requirements to support Special Operations Forces (SOF). Communications Equipment and Electronics Systems is a continuing effort to develop smaller, lighter, more efficient and more robust SOF Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) capabilities.   

USSOCOM's C4 systems comprise an integrated network of systems providing positive command and control and the timely exchange of information to all organizational echelons.  The C4 systems that support this new architecture employ the latest standards and technology by transitioning from separate systems to full integration within the Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a multitude of existing and projected national assets that allows SOF elements to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for development, testing, and integration of specialized automation equipment to meet the unique requirements of Special Operations Forces (SOF). Specialized automation equipment will permit small, highly trained forces to conduct required operations across the entire spectrum of conflict. These operations are generally conducted in harsh environments, for unspecified periods and in locations requiring small unit autonomy. SOF must infiltrate by land, sea, and air to conduct unconventional warfare, direct action, or deep reconnaissance operations in denied areas against insurgent units, terrorists, or highly sophisticated threat forces. The requirement to operate in denied areas controlled by a sophisticated threat mandates that SOF systems remain technologically superior to threat forces to ensure mission success.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project is for the development of all SOF tactical radio programs.  Tactical Radios provide the critical Command, Control, and Communications (C3) link between SOF Commanders and SOF Teams conducting operational missions and training exercises.  They also provide interoperability with all Services, various agencies of the U.S. Government, Air Traffic Control, commercial agencies, and allied foreign forces.  Tactical Radios rapidly and seamlessly establish and maintain mobile and fixed Command and Control (C2) communications between operational elements and higher echelon headquarters, allowing SOF to operate with any force combination in multiple environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

IM solutions shall be tested on a small scale for proof of principle.  Planned product improvements are tested at Army, Navy, and Air Force test centers leveraging mid-tier acquisition authorities and Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs).

SOPGM:  Integration and developmental testing of precision guided munitions will be conducted using government laboratories or industry partners depending on the munitions for various SOF platforms.

PSS:  Integration and developmental testing of the launcher systems with follow-on government-led integration effort leveraging lessons learned from similar rapid integration efforts on other combat tested SOF platforms.

Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS): SOF C-UAS acquisition strategy utilizes MTA rapid prototyping to develop and integrate various advancing sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities. SOF Operators require C-UAS capability in mounted, dismounted and expeditionary fixed-site form factors. SOF C-UAS collaborates with the Joint Services, Academia and other government agencies to maintain interoperability and cost effectiveness. SOF C-UAS will continue to leverage the SOF-to-Service transition of proven capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>NOTE:  Unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) includes the consolidation of Special Applications for Contingencies (SAFC) (previously Program Element (PE) 0304210BB); MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), (previously PE 0305219BB); MQ-8, (previously PE 0305231BB); RQ-11, UAV (previously PE 1105232BB); and RQ-7 UAV, (previously PE 1105233BB).

This program element is part of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  Unmanned ISR rapidly develops and deploys special capabilities to perform ISR for deployed Special Operations Forces (SOF) using non-traditional means.  USSOCOM has been designated as the Department of Defense lead for planning, synchronizing, and as directed, executing global operations against terrorist networks and targets. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requires the capability to find, fix, and finish time-sensitive high-value fixed and fleeting targets at the unit and team level without placing personnel and units in harm’s way. These targets can often only be identified with patient collection of information and require rapid, decisive action during the short periods in which they present themselves. This PE addresses the primary areas of ISR and Targeting capabilities for SOF.  This R-1 program element includes $5.000 million for both FY 2019 and FY 2020 enduring Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding.  FY 2021 funding includes OCO for Enduring Requirements ($5.000 million).  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2021: Net decrease of $15.000 million is due to funding transfer from base (-$5.000 million) to OCO ($5.000 million) for Enduring Requirements.

For the Defense Wide Review (DWR), USSOCOM performed a comprehensive analysis of future capabilities and is reducing the SAFC projects to better align with the Department's priorities as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (-$15.000 million).
-$15.000 million - SAFC - reduces development, integration, evaluation, and miniaturization capability into SOF Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS).

                                <r2:Description>SAFC’s evolutionary development projects quickly provide integrated, SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, air vehicle enhancements and ground control station upgrades to its user community. These efforts rapidly develop and integrate Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) air vehicles, payloads and other technologies to field ISR capabilities and address dynamic and emergent operational needs and vulnerabilities of the SOF user.  Efforts include improving imagery intelligence and electronic warfare payloads, capitalizing on developing technologies to reduce size, weight and power while addressing processing and data management challenges. It also provides a mechanism for SOF user combat evaluation of emerging sensor technologies. SAFC applies focused Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) for relatively low cost solutions to provide short lead-time contingency planning requirements where focused R&amp;D will allow for test and evaluation of leading edge solutions to emergent problem sets.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>SAFC acquisition strategy is evolutionary and spiral-based for technology insertion and low volume procurement.  SAFC utilizes existing competed contract vehicles to the maximum extent possible for minor development and integration and modification of Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. Utilizes limited/full and open competition contracts and rapid acquisition tools for major developments.

The Group 1 UAS/EOTACS are evolutionary acquisition programs that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through a thorough stakeholder's analysis in order to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field.  Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Group 2 MTUAS are evolutionary acquisition solutions  that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique modular mission kits that may include: mission payloads,  weapons, air vehicle enhancements, training systems, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through available acquisition strategy that includes a thorough stakeholder's analysis to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field. Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible but may also leverage Other Transactional Authorities (OTAs) when sensible.   Proprietary considerations may direct some effort to the OEM on a sole source basis.

Group 3 UAS are evolutionary acquisition projects that deliver, integrate, and qualify SOF-unique mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, air vehicle enhancements, and ground control station upgrades.  These capabilities are obtained through a thorough stakeholder's analysis in order to provide well and broadly defined capabilities.  A well-defined stakeholder requirement facilitates rapid development and integration of capabilities, thus more rapidly providing capability to the field. Contracting methods depend on the type of development effort.  Competitive source selection will be conducted as much as possible.  Proprietary considerations may direct some efforts to the OEM.

Group 4 UAS is an evolutionary acquisition program that develops, tests, and integrates SOF peculiar emerging technology mission kits, mission payloads, weapons, and modifications on MQ-1C UAVs, GCS, and training systems. Group 4 UAS provides rapid prototype activities and technology maturation events to increase situational awareness and lethality. Contract types include a mix of cost type and fixed price. Proprietary issues with the aircraft and GCS software as well as aircraft modification may require sole source contracting to the original equipment manufacturer.  Group 4 UAS leverages service common Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and developmental activities and contracts for aircraft and ancillary equipment development, improvement, and sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for the development and testing of a variety of capability upgrades to Special Operations Forces (SOF) Vehicles and ancillary equipment.  Current SOF tactical vehicles are categorized into Light, Medium, Heavy, and Commercial, and include the following: Light Tactical All-Terrain Vehicles (LTATV), Ground Mobility Vehicles (GMV 1.1), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, Non Standard Commercial Vehicles (NSCV), and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).  The SOF mission mandates that SOF vehicles remain technologically superior, operate in multiple environments, and be able to meet any threat to provide a maximum degree of survivability.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element provides for engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) of Special Operations Forces (SOF) Surface and Undersea Mobility platforms.  This program element also provides for pre-acquisition activities to quickly respond to new requirements for SOF surface and undersea mobility, looking at multiple alternatives to include cross-platform technical solutions, service-common solutions, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf technologies, and new development efforts.

The Underwater Systems project provides for EMD of combat submersibles, SOF combat diving systems, underwater support systems, and underwater equipment.  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (material solutions analysis, advanced component, prototype development, and exploitation of emerging technology opportunities to deliver enhanced capabilities) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  

The Surface Craft project provides for EMD of medium and heavy surface combatant craft, combatant craft mission equipment, and pre-planned product improvement and technology insertion engineering changes to meet the unique requirements of SOF.  This project element also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to quickly respond to new requirements for maritime craft and subsystems.  The craft capabilities and unique equipment provide small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

FY 2019:  Net decrease of $1.871 million is due to a transfer to Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) (-$1.520 million) and funds made available to support critical emerging Command requirements in the year of execution (-$0.351 million).

FY 2020:  Net zero is due to a Congressional Directed Reduction which was a decrease within the Dry Combat Submersible (-$3.000 million) and a Congressional Add increase for SOF Combat Diving ($3.000 million). 

FY 2021:  Net decrease of $2.039 million is due to an increase to align Tech Insertion Roadmap (TIR) for combatant craft systems for enhanced Global Positioning System (GPS), survivability and hybrid power study; SOF Peculiar Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) payloads; and integration of Maritime Precision Engagement (MPE) prototype on Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) test article ($3.004 million), and Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) funding was made available to support critical emerging Command requirements (-$0.450 million).

For the Defense Wide Review (DWR), USSOCOM performed a comprehensive analysis of future capabilities which reduces the product development and integration of the Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH) program to better align with the Department’s priorities as outlined in the National Defense Strategy (-$4.593 million).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project provides for engineering and manufacturing development of combat underwater submersibles, Special Operations Forces (SOF) combat diving systems, underwater support systems, and underwater equipment.  This project also provides for pre-acquisition activities (materiel solutions analysis, advanced component development and prototypes) to respond to emergent requirements.  These submersibles, equipment, and diving systems are used by SOF in the conduct of infiltration/extraction, personnel/material recovery, hydrographic/inland reconnaissance, beach obstacle clearance, underwater ship attack, and other missions.  The capabilities of the submersible systems, diving systems, and unique equipment provides small, highly trained forces the ability to successfully engage the enemy and conduct clandestine operations associated with SOF maritime missions.  These technologies will be pursued via rapid prototyping efforts when appropriate.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The full spectrum of contracting activities are being utilized for any integration and subsystem requirements, using existing contracts where appropriate, government agencies, and new contracts as necessary. Sole source Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) was approved and awarded to deliver final production Articles to meet full operational capability (FOC). 

•  DCS used full and open competition, resulting in the selection of a single prime contractor and award of a Fixed Price Incentive Firm Target contract for three vessels.  DCS-Block II begins market research in FY 2020.

•  The DDS is currently in sustainment through a maintenance and service contract which was competitively sourced, and awarded for a five-year period.  The modernization and engineering/change efforts for the six DDS in inventory are executed utilizing the existing services contract.  

•  SOF Combat Diving is designated an MTA program which supports rapid prototyping and is executed using existing contracts, government agencies, and new contracts competitively selected as appropriate.  

•  UCME will use streamlined Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contracting with existing or planned Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Blanket Order Agreement (BOA), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contracts and use Non-FAR Acquisition Authorities and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, where appropriate. 

•  UUV will procure an existing service common man-portable UUV and augment it with purpose built, modular, plug-and-play sensors and payloads to meet SOF requirements.

•  CCL engineering and manufacturing development was sole source.  Program Management Office (PMO) is evaluating limited competition for follow-on production contract contingent on cost tradeoffs and completeness of technical data.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>•  CCM was a two-phase source selection process.  Phase I involved a Small Business Set-Aside competition for two vendors to design, build and deliver test articles.  Phase II selected a single vendor to provide a fully integrated baseline craft system for test and evaluation with options for production, engineering support, and contractor logistics support.  

•  CCH SEALION I &amp; II were transitioned from United States Navy advanced technology demonstrator craft to USSOCOM.  Sustainment for SEALION I &amp; II is conducted via Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA).  SEALION III is Sole Source to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in order to take advantage of previous Government investments in manufacturing infrastructure for SEALION I &amp; II.  

•  CCME will use streamlined Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contracting with existing or planned Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Blanket Order Agreement (BOA), University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), and Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contracts and use Non-FAR Acquisition Authorities and Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, where appropriate.  

•  CCA will continue to develop, test, and integrate capability enhancements required to increase the crafts performance characteristics, reliability, and survivability.  

•  MPE will employ Government engineering expertise and lessons learned to develop a common launch system for NSW combatant craft.  Munitions selection will be executed as an MTA to meet program requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

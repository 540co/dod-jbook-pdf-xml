            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Development Agency (SDA) is developing and fielding next generation space capabilities enabled by proliferation and a new acquisition model utilizing rapid spiral development.  SDA is developing capabilities to address a wide range of Department space needs, including low-latency tactical communication, beyond line of sight targeting, and advanced missile tracking.  Specifically, the SDA will demonstrate and field persistent, resilient capabilities needed to be responsive to emerging multi-domain threats against the U.S. national interest. The SDA will be responsible for overall programmatic policy development and execution for next-generation military space capabilities, except those funded in the Military Intelligence Program (MIP).  In coordination with other DoD Space stakeholders, the SDA will drive the development of space capabilities to achieve the DoD space vision and reduce overlap and inefficiency.  The SDA will expand the Department's space warfighting capability and foster growth in the U.S. space industrial base, the SDA will incorporate enhanced government-commercial relationships and international collaboration with key allies and partners.

While SDA is not responsible for building and fielding all layers of the National Defense Space Architecture, it is responsible for ensuring capability deliveries.  In this construct, SDA is responsible for building and fielding the Transport layer, a proliferated constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high volume data to the warfighter.  This transport layer will be compatible with the architecture defined by Fully Networked Command, Control, and Communications Network.

The establishment of a proliferated data transport layer is essential to developing a new and responsive space architecture.  The SDA will develop additional sub-constellations on this transport layer to provide additional capabilities, such as advanced missile warning, custody and alternative position, navigation and timing (PNT).

This program element funds efforts to develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated communications and data transport layer and other capability layers in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SDA will rapidly develop and field the next generation space architecture that will enable the US to deploy space capabilities that out-pace adversarial threats.  This architecture is underpinned by a data transport layer, which will reside on a proliferated small satellite constellation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  The Transport Layer will support the transfer of data between the space segment of the next generation space architecture, to include payloads co-hosted with the Transport Layer or other non-collocated space elements, and the ground, to include ground support infrastructure and very large numbers of users/subscribers.  The Transport Layer will provide the "connective tissue" for the next generation space architecture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Space Development Agency (SDA) is established to develop the next generation space architecture to enable U.S. military operations to be responsive to emerging multi-domain threats against our national security.  To achieve that goal, the SDA will help inform the Department's decision to develop and implement a proliferated architecture enabled by lower-cost, mass-produced spacecraft and routine space access, shift the Department to a development organization focused on experimentation, prototyping, and accelerated fielding, and change the Department to a concentrated, decoupled structure to generate speed.  The SDA will manage, direct, and execute the development of the space capabilities in accordance with DoD’s Space Vision and field space capabilities at speed and scale, with the following goals: 

•	bold breakthroughs designed to out-pace our competitors,
•	technology maturation and systems engineering,
•	lean engineering, manufacturing, and support,
•	industrial base expansion; streamlined development and acquisition process, and
•	increased acquisition cooperation with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).

The SDA will rapidly deploy critical elements of the next-generation space capabilities, initially focusing on these essential capabilities: 

•	Persistent global surveillance for advanced missile targeting,
•	Indications, warnings, targeting, and tracking for defense against advanced missile threats,
•	Alternate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) for a GPS-denied environment,
•	Global and near-real time space situational awareness,
•	Development of a deterrent capability
•	Responsive, resilient, common ground-based space support infrastructure (e.g., ground stations and launch capability),
•	Cross-domain, networked, node-independent battle management command, control, and communications (BMC3), and 
•	Highly-scaled, low-latency, persistent, artificial intelligence-enable global surveillance. 

The establishment of a data transport layer in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is essential to developing a new, responsive space architecture, and will be SDA’s primary initial focus.  The SDA will develop an initial wedge of sub-constellations on this transport layer to provide additional capabilities, such as advanced missile warning.

This program element funds efforts to develop and demonstrate a prototype proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) communications and data transport layer and its sub-constellations in support of the DoD Space Vision.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The SDA will rapidly develop and field the next generation space architecture that will enable the US to deploy space capabilities that out-pace adversarial threats.  This architecture is underpinned by a common satellite buses, common interfaces between payloads to the bus, and common data interfaces and standards.  The SDA will develop these standards for high power and lower power buses.  SDA will develop standard interfaces across these two classes of satellite buses.  SDA, in collaboration with other Space Stakeholders, will develop communication standards, and a ground architecture including user equipment that supports satellites utilizing these standardized products.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Developing and fielding a pLEO space architecture will significantly improve U.S. resilience posture in space.  The Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Launch project will further support this vision of enhanced resilience.  Global and near real-time SSA will provide a detailed understanding of the space order of battle and a responsive launch capability needed to enable rapid constitution or replenishment of space capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Development Agency (SDA) is developing and fielding next generation space capabilities enabled by proliferation and a new acquisition model utilizing rapid spiral development.  SDA is developing capabilities to address a wide range of Department space needs, including low-latency tactical communication, beyond line of sight targeting, and advanced missile tracking.  SDA will orchestrate the rapid development and fielding of the National Defense Space Architecture (NDSA), a resilient military sensing and data transport capability via a proliferated space architecture in low-earth orbit. 

This program element funds the space technology development and prototyping activity to deliver a resilient military sensing and data transport capability via a proliferated space architecture to US joint warfighting forces in two-year tranches, beginning as early as FY22. These capabilities including a low-latency mesh network data transport layer; advanced missile tracking layer; global surveillance and surface moving target custody layer; low-latency sensor tasking, command and control, and data dissemination layer; alternate position, navigation, and timing layer; enhanced space situational awareness and deterrence layer; and common ground segment and launch services layer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

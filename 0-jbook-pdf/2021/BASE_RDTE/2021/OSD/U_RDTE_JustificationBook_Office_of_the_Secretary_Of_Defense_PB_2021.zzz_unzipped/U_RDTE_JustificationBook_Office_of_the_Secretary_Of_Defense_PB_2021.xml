            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Basic research provides the Department of Defense (DoD) with a deep and broad awareness of current directions in areas of research important to U.S. military capabilities – including physics and the physical sciences, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, computer science, mechanical and aerodynamic engineering, ocean sciences, biological sciences, and the social sciences, among others.  Basic research sustains scientific and engineering communities as it generates the critical technical knowledge underpinnings of DoD capabilities.  Basic research allows exploration and discovery, yielding disruptive non-incremental advances that can improve or radically change military capabilities, strategy, and operations.

The Basic Research Initiatives program element (PE) supports the defense basic research enterprise in three critical areas:  Strategic Support for Basic Research (SSBR), the Minerva Research Initiative (MRI), and the Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship Program (VBFF).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Minerva Research Initiative includes three primary components:  (1) a university-based social science basic research grant program, funded in partnership with Air Force and Navy University Research Initiatives; (2) the Defense Education and Civilian University Research (DECUR) Partnership program for the professional military education (PME) institutions; and (3) a collaboration with the Congressionally-established United States Institute of Peace to award research support to advanced graduate students and early career scholars working on security and peace.  All components contribute to Minerva's goals of revitalizing connections between DoD and academic social science communities and building cultural and foreign area knowledge on topics ranging from China-Russia great power competition, National Defense Strategy (NDS) strategic priorities, to geopolitical power projection strategies in a multi-polar world.  This deeper scientific understanding will provide a more informed basis to shape doctrine, analysis, and other strategic and operational decisions made by war planners and warfighters.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Defense Education Program (NDEP) fosters and enhances the Department of Defense’s (DoD) ability to access high-quality science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) talent vital to national defense now and in the future.  NDEP is executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  NDEP’s portfolio includes workforce development programs, such as the Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program; Military family programs, such as the Military Child Program (MCP); STEM Education and Outreach; and the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP).  These programs provide a pathway to the best and the brightest minds through a continuum of DoD workforce development approaches, which include:  (1) broadening STEM literacy in K through College continuum to prepare for postsecondary success in STEM disciplines and providing DoD and the Nation enduring access to talent needed to address ever-changing future defense workforce needs; (2) providing awareness of the Department as a STEM workplace of choice for scientists and engineers through programs and outreach; (3) leading the Departmental STEM strategic efforts to ensure alignment with the workforce and mission requirements; and (4) leveraging strategic partners with a shared mission in identifying innovative approaches to developing the Nation's current and future STEM talent.

The NDEP aligns to the National Defense Strategy and the DoD science and technology (S&amp;T) priorities.  The program is also aligned to the 2018 Federal STEM Education Strategic Plan, and the DoD STEM Strategic Plan. NDEP components engage in assessment and evaluation practices as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office.

The SMART program awards highly competitive scholarships-for-service to undergraduate and graduate students in 21 STEM academic disciplines and hires the students, upon graduation, into DoD's workforce.  As part of the SMART experience, scholars engage in internships that allow for relevant hands-on research and work experiences in DoD facilities, thereby enhancing their educational experience. Since its inception as a pilot program in FY 2005, SMART has awarded approximately 3,000 scholarships to students ranging from undergraduate to doctoral studies.  To date, approximately 2,000 students have completed their academic pursuit and transitioned into DoD employment. Approximately 1,200 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 71 percent of those participants continue to be employed by DoD SMART ensures the Department has a steady infusion of high-quality technical talent, prepared in areas of critical importance to DoD, and ready to apply their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill DoD’s mission.

The MCP provides dependents of members of the Armed Forces educational and outreach opportunities in STEM to prepare for pathways in STEM-related careers.  Additionally, MCP also provides assistance to STEM teachers at elementary or secondary schools at which a significant number of military dependents are enrolled.  Section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2015, and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, authorized the establishment of this Pilot Program.  By FY 2021, the pilot program will be absorbed into the DoD STEM portfolio of program activities.

STEM Education and Outreach fosters activities to support and cultivate STEM talent with minds for innovation, diversity of thought, and the technical agility to sustain the Department’s competitive edge.  In order to build a workforce that brings in an expansion of ideas to solve national defense needs and challenges, the DoD recognizes the need for increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.  Initiatives include investing, promoting, and participating in national-level STEM programs and efforts, as well as providing authentic hands-on STEM experiences for students and teachers across the Nation.

The DoD is consistently looking for innovative scientific and technological solutions to address current and future military requirements.  The MEEP will enhance existing or establish new education programs that support manufacturing engineering.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>Workforce Development - Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) Defense Education Program</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Description: SMART is a scholarship-for-service program that provides support to high performing U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in 21 academic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines identified as areas of future workforce priorities for the DoD.

The disciplines align with the Department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) priorities and emerging scientific research areas such as:  Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering; Biosciences; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Cognitive, Neural, and Behavioral Sciences; Computer Science; Electrical Engineering; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences; Industrial and Systems Engineering; Information Sciences; Materials Science and Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanical Engineering; Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering; Nuclear Engineering; Oceanography; Operations Research; and Physics.  Upon completion of their degree, students fulfill a service commitment to the Department on a one-to-one payback per year of education funded.

In part, SMART's success is measured by participants that choose to remain in the DoD workforce beyond their required service commitment.  Approximately 1,200 participants have successfully completed the program through their DoD Service commitment, of which 71 percent of those participants continue to be employed by DoD.

Oversight of the SMART program falls under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  Two types of individuals participate in the program: (1) retention scholars who are current DoD employees; and (2) recruitment scholars who are students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs and represent new technical expertise for the Department.  Internships provide SMART scholars with an opportunity to engage in the DoD science and technology enterprise through research and work experiences in defense laboratories, thereby enhancing their educational experience and understanding the relevance of DoD research priority areas.

Since FY 2005, approximately 3,000 students have participated in the SMART program at approximately 190 sponsoring facilities.  As of October 2018, approximately 2,000 SMART scholars have transitioned into the service commitment phase.  To date, these scholars have transitioned as civilian employees into the Air Force, Army, Navy, and other DoD components.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program addresses applied research associated with improving the lethality, reliability, safety, and survivability of munitions and weapon systems. The goal is to develop joint enabling technologies that can be used by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) as they develop their specific weapon programs. The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts. Increasing the lethality, range and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments. This munitions based science and technology (S&amp;T) program focuses on enhancements in weapon speed, range, and lethality while largely utilizing existing advanced insensitive munitions (IM) technology to maximize weapon safety. U.S. power projection capabilities related to near peer competition are lagging and there is an urgent need to provide US warfighters with increased or new capabilities. The program is striving to develop the most lethal weapons possible and communicating associated risks intelligently, so U.S. warfighters can make informed decisions about their weapon systems capabilities and safe handling requirements. IM compliance requirements remain an important aspect of munitions reliability and readiness and thus will remain a critical characteristic of the program. The 2018 National Defense Strategy denotes that “Challenges to the U.S. military advantage represent another shift in the global security environment. For decades the United States has enjoyed uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. Today, every domain is contested—air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.” Therefore, the program will invest in technologies that will enable U.S. warfighters to regain the operational and battlefield advantages that technologies can provide through increased performance, range, and lethality to improve the Joint Force military advantages and build a more lethal force. This program's investment portfolio has been aligned to complement, and utilize, the Department's priority technology areas.
Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) are established for each munition and capability area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2025, 2030, and 2035 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their weapons system strategic plans / Fuze Technology Development Plans, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate. The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives, plus senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The enhanced munitions effort will explore and develop advanced energetics concepts and explosive and propellant materials with the potential to improve the performance, range, and lethality of weapons. Technologies and concepts developed will have the potential to impact multiple munitions technologies with wide applicability to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.

The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (Area Effects Warheads), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (Hard Target Effects Warheads), and 5) Gun Propulsion. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan. These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This RDT&amp;E effort will demonstrate fuze enabling technologies needed to develop weapons that address Joint priority capability areas including ones highlighted by OSD R&amp;E Technology-Focused Modernization and Service S&amp;T priorities such as Hypersonics, Long Range Precision Fires, Air Defense and Scalable Lethality. This effort will develop enabling technologies at the laboratory scale and transition them into Budget Activity (BA) 6.3 demonstration programs for weapons where priority capabilities and technology needs have been identified and validated by the Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and the Heads of the Service Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities. Mature BA 6.2 fuze technologies will be transitioned, thereby decreasing their program costs and schedule risk and facilitating spin-offs to other munitions within their portfolios.
The Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) investments are focused on capability areas that driven by next generation hypersonic and advanced weapons. The four capability areas are:
1) Extreme Environment Survivable Fuzing, 2) Tailorable Effects Fuzing and Warhead Initiation, 3) High Reliability Safe and Arm Technology, and 4) Target Detection and Burst Point Control.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The enhanced munitions effort will explore and develop advanced energetics concepts and explosive and propellant materials with the potential to improve the performance, range, and lethality of weapons. Technologies and concepts developed will have the potential to impact multiple munitions technologies with wide applicability to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.
The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Area Effects Warheads, 4) Hard Target Effects Warheads, and 5) Gun Propulsion. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan.  These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) research project 534 is an advanced technology research and development effort conducted through a cost reimbursable contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The MIT LL project supports innovative, multi-disciplined research that addresses critical national security problems. The LL project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, components, and materials in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.  The project funds nine technology areas.  Note: In FY 2019, the tenth technology area, Cyber Security, Science and Engineering, moved to individual project code 815.

Of the technology areas, there are four core-technology areas:  Advanced Devices; Optical Systems and Technology; Information, Computation and Exploitation Sciences; and Radio-Frequency (RF) Systems and Technologies.  There are four emerging-technology initiatives:  Advanced Materials and Processes; Quantum System Sciences; Biomedical Sciences and Technology; and Autonomous Systems.  There is one Integrated Systems technology area, which focuses on combining novel component-level technologies to create system-level technology solutions for important DoD problems. 

These nine technology areas provide critical capabilities that support all DoD mission areas pursued at the Laboratory. The categories are selected in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)), are aligned with DoD Communities of Interest (CoI), and with guidance from other DoD agencies to address technology as well as system needs. The research in these categories adapts to solve emerging DoD problems as well as longstanding problems to which new technology advances can be applied. The individual efforts in each area are selected with the goal of enhancing DoD capabilities significantly, rather than incrementally.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Technical Intelligence, project 535.  The Technical Intelligence project provides global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context in order to assist the DoD decision-makers plan for an uncertain future. The program uses intelligence-based and open-source information to characterize today’s global S&amp;T environment, exploiting novel technology watch and horizon scanning (TW/HS) tools to identify nascent and disruptive technologies that will shape tomorrow’s future. The program complements this with tailored technical assessments that identify the military relevance, research opportunities, and policy recommendations for emerging and disruptive technologies.

Supporting these and other priority technology and capability areas are work efforts titled Cyber Security, Science and Engineering under project code 815, which began in FY 2019.  The Cyber Security, Science and Engineering research project 815 supports innovative research that addresses critical national security problems in cyber. The project funds innovations that directly lead to the development of new system concepts, technologies, and algorithms in support of Department of Defense (DoD) missions. Funding supports high-risk, high-payoff research, which provides unique and specialized capabilities for the current and emerging needs of the DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Autonomous systems are playing an increasingly important role in the DoD. A concept for autonomous undersea mapping, developed in FY 2018, will be tested in a tank, and then in an initial ocean test, in FY 2019. As swarms become more important work on algorithms, for resilience in degraded environments and risk taking by one for the good of all, are being developed. Work on human machine teaming, including algorithm and scenario development, can begin to enable robots to learn, co-adapt to their human counterparts, and share decision-making authority dynamically. Facilitate operations in uncertain, complex and dynamic environments by algorithm development for 3D semantic map construction and for autonomous task execution in simulated environments. Finally, another new effort is bringing tools from AI to complex air and missile defense scenarios to help facilitate the effective allocation and coordination of heterogeneous resources in real time against a large number of threats, with infrequent direct war fighter input. Incorporation of algorithms from the commercial world will hasten the development of autonomous systems for the DoD.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As adversaries develop more sophisticated technology and tactics and become more skilled and better funded, the cyber S&amp;T community must accelerate the pace of innovative research. Judiciously exploring research under these thrust areas should provide a distinct advantage in future cyber conflicts.  Following a review and assessment of emerging joint operational needs, OUSD(R&amp;E) developed four (4) research areas to enhance the DoD’s tactical edge in a rapidly evolving cyber domain (described below):  

• Behavioral Cyber Science:  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior by moving beyond binary electronic signals towards understanding human behavior.  New insights from behavioral science will increase the effectiveness of tools, increase the effectiveness of the cyber workforce, and improve the utility of cyber solutions.  Behavioral cyber science seeks to uncover details about how humans (represented by operators, users, adversaries, and/or defenders) react to cyber actions and how those reactions can be understood, from a behavioral science standpoint, and leveraged to create more effective actions and outcomes.

• Self-Securing Systems:  Prevailing in a contested cyber environment will require new sciences and mechanisms for autonomous cybersecurity to protect the increasingly complex weapon systems and platforms that help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Exploring foundational research in self-securing systems will arm future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly assess cyber threats.  Additionally, future systems will be able to deploy self-defense mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks and enable blue forces to maneuver at will.  Autonomous cyber defenses will need to apply the most current advances in artificial intelligence research.

• Precise Cyber Effects:  Precision offensive campaigns for the cyber domain require accurate and timely predictions of cyber effects to enable DoD leadership to achieve the desired outcomes from cyber operations and help manage risks associated with collateral damage.  Exploring methods to derive quantifiable metrics will help improve the precision control of selecting cyber mission targets and raise the accuracy of effects; achieving an understanding of second and third order of effects will provide commanders with a higher confidence of success and limit collateral damage.

• Applied Mathematics for Cyber:  Advancing mathematical foundations that are intrinsically linked to all branches of cyber science and technology, will cut across focus areas producing new methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  This area of research will characterize the cyber domain, maintain the integrity of data, harden systems, analyze potential solutions, and counter adversarial machine learning. 

Advances in these cyber S&amp;T areas will promote strong foundations, while disruptive innovations will create surprise, shape the fight, and ensure a decisive advantage.  The research areas are critical to the development of innovative and sustainable research that takes cybersecurity beyond the incremental escalation of attack and defense.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Integrating both defensive and offensive innovative cyber research within the DoD cyber science and technology (S&amp;T) enterprise to develop interoperable, defense-wide technology options that address joint force challenges in full spectrum cyber operations.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) recognized cyber as an actively contested domain with significant security challenges and potential leap-ahead capabilities for military operations.  By focusing on higher risk research ideas with major potential impacts, the Cybersecurity program addresses one of the NDS’s mission focus areas of cybersecurity.  The program works to advance the state of cybersecurity by judiciously exploring research in the areas of Behavioral Cyber Science; Self-Securing Systems; Precise Cyber Effects; and Applied Mathematics for Cyber.  These thrusts provide an opportunity to identify and advance foundational technologies to support all Services and Agencies.  

Research in Behavioral Cyber Science advances understanding and the technical rigor of modeling and predicting human responses to cyber activities that enhance cyber operations through planning, and training.  Exploring the interaction between computers and human behavior, moving beyond electronic signals (ones and zeroes) enables development of new insights to human behavior.  Exploring Self-Securing Systems, platforms, and networks will help DoD operators react more quickly to cyber-attacks.  Equipping future DoD systems with the capability to proactively, autonomously, and seamlessly access cyber threats and deploy self-securing mechanisms to neutralize cyber-attacks, offers blue force an innovative new disruptive capability.  Precise Cyber Effects provide scalable cyber options for military cyber commanders to precisely identify and engage specific threats and targets with a high confidence of success.  This high-risk research provides a disproportionate advantage in modeling cyber with high variability architectures for blue, gray, and red space that would potentially afford real opportunities.  Finally advancements in mathematical foundations of cyber cut across all three thrust areas producing new provable methods to design, secure, and reason about complex cyber systems.  There is a need for an array of formal and informal modeling techniques, backed by various rigorous mathematical theories, to capture and support the richness of the cyber domain.</r2:Description>

Promising projects proceed into advanced technology development through this PE.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives. The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.

Software is critical to meeting the Department of Defense's (DoD) increasing demand for national defense systems that are high-quality, affordable, and deployed in a timely way. With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership in all aspects of software-based system development, operation, defense, and evolution to avoid strategic surprise.  To assist the DoD in retaining a long-term differential advantage over potential adversaries, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Applied Research program element (PE) develops and evaluates the feasibility and practicality of software and computer science concepts, with the potential to improve future DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>To gain full advantage from data and information generated by software for use in missions, DoD needs to assure its software is free of vulnerabilities.  In its complex systems, DoD may use software developed from an unknown supply chain that may include intentionally or unintentionally introduced vulnerabilities.  This thrust seeks to develop scalable automated methods to locate, understand, and mitigate the effects of these vulnerabilities.  Automated solutions developed through this thrust will be used to discover vulnerabilities in system software source code and to generate proofs of correctness or fault.  Additionally, they will be used to model and simulate operational environments to support software and cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures testing.</r2:Description>

The two project codes within each PE form the 6.2 applied research and 6.3 technology demonstration components of the Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) and the Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP). The JEMTP funds its applied research efforts using PE 0602000D8Z Project code (P) 076 Enhanced Munitions and its technology demonstration efforts using PE 0603000D8Z P077 Enhanced Munitions Applied Technology. The JFTP funds its applied research efforts using PE 0602000D8Z P204 Enabling Fuze Technology and its technology demonstration efforts using PE 0603000D8Z P301 Enabling Fuze Advanced Technology.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program advances and demonstrates munitions components (warheads, propulsion systems, advanced lethality mechanisms, fuzes and fuze components, etc.) in relevant environments with joint applicability. The goal is to demonstrate joint enabling technologies that increase or improve the lethality, range, reliability, safety, and survivability for existing and future weapons systems. The program invests in research of technologies from a Joint Service perspective, thus maximizing efficiencies, ensuring the development of technologies with the broadest applicability while avoiding duplication of efforts. Increasing the lethality, range and performance of munitions, while striving to increase the safety for our warfighters for munitions in procurement and under development guide program investments. This munitions based Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program focuses on enhancements in weapon speed, range, and lethality while largely utilizing existing advanced insensitive munitions (IM) technology to maximize weapon safety. US power projection capabilities related to near peer competition are lagging and there is an urgent need to provide our warfighters with increased or new capabilities. The program will strive to develop the most lethal weapons possible and communicating associated risks intelligently, so U.S. warfighters can make informed decisions about their weapon systems capabilities and safe handling requirements. IM compliance requirements remain an important aspect of munitions reliability and readiness and thus will remain a critical characteristic of the program. The 2018 National Defense Strategy denotes that “Challenges to the U.S. military advantage represent another shift in the global security environment. For decades the United States has enjoyed uncontested or dominant superiority in every operating domain. Today, every domain is contested—air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace.” Therefore, the program will invest in technologies that will enable U.S. warfighters to regain the operational and battlefield advantages that technologies can provide through increased performance, range, and lethality to improve the Joint Force military advantages and build a more lethal force.  This program is has aligned its investment portfolio to complement and utilize priority technology areas (hypersonics, autonomy, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and microelectronics) defined by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.
Munition Area Technology Groups (MATGs) and Fuze Area Technology Groups (FATGs) are established for each technology area and are tasked with: 1) coordinating, establishing, and maintaining 2025, 2030, and 2035 year technology development plans and roadmaps, 2) coordinating biannual meetings to review technical and programmatic details of each funded and proposed effort, 3) developing and submitting Technology Transition Agreements in coordination with appropriate PEOs for insertion in their weapons system strategic plans / Fuze Technology Development Plans, and 4) interfacing with other MATGs / FATGs and IM / fuze science and technology projects as appropriate. The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) and Joint Fuze Technology Program (JFTP) utilize a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) (consisting of senior Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) technology experts and laboratory representatives, plus senior Munitions PEO representatives) to provide program oversight, policy, direction, and priorities during its annual meeting.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Munitions Advanced Technology effort will demonstrate enabling technologies and perform associated applied research that will improve the performance, range, and lethality of existing and future weapons systems. This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based munitions in the concept and development stages. Mature demonstrated Enhanced Munitions technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the PEO’s program costs and schedule risk, facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios. Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.
The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Rocket Propulsion, 2) Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion, 3) Blast and Fragmentation Warheads (Area Effects Warheads), 4) Anti-Armor Warheads (Hard Target Effects Warheads), and 5) Gun Propulsion. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri-service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which is used to guide investments based on goals consistent with the DoD IM Strategic Plan. These IM technologies, alone or in combination, will be incorporated in hardware, simulating real-world munitions, to demonstrate their utility and feasibility as part of Technology Transition Agreements with PEOs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funds in this new Project Code will be used to develop and demonstrate early applied weapons system science and technology (i.e., energetic ingredients, formulations, consolidation techniques, warheads, and propulsion technologies) focused on enhancing weapons lethality, range, and performance in the Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Munitions Advanced Technology effort will demonstrate enabling technologies and perform associated applied research that will improve the performance, range, and lethality of existing and future weapons systems. This effort will take promising technologies demonstrated at the laboratory scale and transition them into demonstration programs utilizing generic hardware based munitions in the concept and development stages. Mature demonstrated Enhanced Munitions technology can be transitioned, thereby decreasing the PEO’s program costs and schedule risk, facilitating spin-offs to other non-compliant munitions within their portfolios. Technologies demonstrated seek to improve the performance, lethality, and range of weapons to ensure the U.S. is not outgunned and outranged on the battlefield of the future.
The Joint Enhanced Munitions Technology Program (JEMTP) investments focus on five Munition Areas: 1) High Performance Propulsion - Alternative propulsion designs and systems for increased range, e.g. rotating detonation engines, solid fuel ramjets, highly loaded grain technology, etc.; 2) Minimum Signature Propulsion – new propellant compositions and hybrid propulsion for reduced time to target/increased range; 3) Area Effects Warheads – high performance explosives, reactive materials, multiphase blast, etc.; 4) Hard Target Effects Warheads – improved penetration for shaped charge jets, lethality enhancements for area effects munitions; and 5) Gun Propulsion – novel ignition schemes, advanced propellant design, etc. Munition Area Technology Groups (MATG), under tri- service leadership, have developed technology roadmaps for each Munition Area which are used to guide investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Enhanced Munitions Advanced Technology focuses on the following key areas:
- High Performance Rocket Propulsion (HPP) - focuses on the development of technologies to improve the range and speed of HPP systems, rocket motors with Ammonium Perchlorate and with or without a metal fuel, for rockets and missiles launched from air, ground, and sea platforms.
- Minimum Signature Rocket Propulsion (MSP) - focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies to improve MS rocket propellant formulations and ingredients, including synthesis, characterization and scale-up; case and packaging design; active and passive venting techniques; rocket motor case design; ignition systems; and thrust mitigation techniques.
- Area Effects Warheads (AEW) focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies that when applied enhance the lethality of Area Effects munitions.
- Hard Target Effects Warheads (HTEW) - focuses on the development of explosive ingredients, explosives, and warhead technologies for improving performance of HTEW munitions.
- Gun Propulsion (GP) - focuses on the development and demonstration of technologies in the area of GP systems. The development and demonstration of gun propulsion technologies, when applied to munition systems, will improve the range and/or time to target of all gun launched munitions to include small/medium caliber, tank/mortar and large caliber propulsion systems.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>OCO for Base Requirements ($19,288 thousand):  OCO for Base Requirements is funding to pay for base budget requirements, that are financed in the OCO budget in order for the Department to comply with the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2019.

Defense-Wide Reviews (DWR) - Funding for the CTTS Initiative was reduced by $23,492 thousand resulting from the DWR, which focused on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage.   Base reduction of 17,062 thousand and OCO reduction of 6,430 thousand.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Combating Terrorism Technical Support (CTTS) program supports the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and will give those identified peer-to-peer high interest areas increased priority.  CTTS also recognizes that many of the combating terrorism requirements already supports many of these high interest areas; to include, increasing lethal capability of U.S. forces at the squad and small unit level; countering Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (drones) overseas and domestically; tunnel detection and mapping in theater and along the Southwest U.S. border; novel body and vehicle armor; detecting and mitigating novel chemical threats against commercial transportation; telematics; covert communications; and the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  
From a broader perspective, projects remain distributed among 10 mission categories, in line with the interagency Technical Support Working Group (TSWG): Advanced Analytic Capabilities; Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives; Improvised Device Defeat/Explosives Countermeasures; Investigative and Forensic Science; Irregular Warfare and Evolving Threats; Personnel Protection; Physical Security; Surveillance, Collection, and Operations Support; Tactical Operations Support; and Training Technology Development.
While supporting the NDS, the CTTS program will also continue to identify capabilities to combat terrorism and irregular adversaries and quickly delivers these capabilities to U.S. Defense and interagency users, as well as international partners through rapid research and development, advanced studies, and technical innovation.  CTTS continues to expand its partnerships with other Defense and Interagency, as well as with our foreign partners’ rapid development and acquisition organizations to leverage their expertise and prevent duplication as it tries to expedite and transition new and innovative capabilities for Defense and interagency users.  CTTS is unique in its approach, annually obtaining joint requirements directly from military and law enforcement operators, intelligence analyst, and first responders.
The CTTS program is a diverse, advanced technology development effort that capitalizes on interagency and international participation to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of technology when applied to combating terrorism requirements. This includes rapid technology capability development, testing products, proof-of-concept demonstrations in field applications, operational test and evaluations, and coordinating the transition from development to operational use. For FY 2021, the time from requirements to contracts has been shortened in order to provide solutions even more rapidly to the users.  CTTS normally manages approximately 250 individual projects in support of defense, federal, state, local, and international customers and partners; while also reviewing proposals and negotiating contracts for another 100 requirements prior to the next fiscal year.
The CTTS program justified in the R-2 exhibit identifies the projects fully or partially funded by Congressional appropriations for the CTTS program. However, CTTS also develops technology and provides support using external funds provided by other DoD and federal departments and international partnerships. These projects and support activities are not necessarily reflected in this justification R-2; but the number of activities do reflect positively on the trust and competence that CTTS has earned throughout the Department of Defense and interagency to rapidly conduct critical RDT&amp;E and provide innovative products.  The funding and number of requirements from users that CTTS will be able to address in FY 2021 has been reduced by 25% in accordance with the Secretary’s directed Defense Wide Review Task 266.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program increases Joint Force readiness and lethality by providing near-term solutions to existing and future Department of Defense (DoD) capability gaps by leveraging the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) investments of allied nations and coalition partners.  The FCT Program Element (PE) evaluates prototypes derived from allied and partner nation technologies to provide the U.S. Armed Services, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and Defense agencies capabilities to counter emerging threats.  FCT’s broad reach across our allies and friendly foreign countries enables development of innovative, cost effective, and interoperable solutions to meet needs communicated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders.  Military Services and USSOCOM jointly conduct FCT projects.  FCT strengthens alliances by facilitating international collaboration and evaluating technologies that increase interoperability while serving as a catalyst for teaming and other business relationships between international and domestic industries.  Partner nations recognize the long-term value of the "two-way street" for Defense procurements for which FCT provides an avenue.  Numerous successful projects have resulted in the licensed production of a qualified foreign item in the United States, including the creation of jobs and contributions to local economies.  To date, companies from 34 states have benefited from FCT projects.  FCT supports DoD best practices by incentivizing the use of prototyping and experimentation in advancing technological solutions to warfighter problems and acts as a hedge against threat developments.  FCT enhances affordability by reducing development costs and risk, accelerating acquisition timelines, and increasing competition.  Through increasing Joint lethality and readiness, strengthening alliances, and delivering affordable performance on accelerated timelines, FCT supports all three lines of effort outlined in the National Defense Strategy.  Authorized by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2350a (g), the FCT program is managed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&amp;E), Comparative Technology Office (CTO). 

Measurable Outcomes:
-FCT projects will demonstrate capability objectives within 12-36 months.
-Over its 40-year history, FCT has a transition rate of 58 percent (357 out of 612) for completed projects.  Of the 357 projects that tested successful, 280 or 78 percent resulted in follow on procurements of over $11.000 billion.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of the Department of Defense (DoD)/Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Munitions Technology Development Program (JMP) is to develop new and innovative warhead, advanced and disruptive explosive, fuzing, weapons effects, and lifecycle technologies and tools to enable significant improvements in conventional munitions.  The JMP supports the development and exploration of advanced munitions concepts and enabling technologies that precede Service-specific system engineering.  A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1985 by DoD and DOE provides the basis for the cooperative effort and for cost-sharing the long-term commitment.  The DoD JMP funds budgeted in this justification are matched, at a minimum, dollar for dollar by DOE funds.  Through this interdepartmental cooperation, DoD’s relatively small investment leverages DOE’s substantial investments in intellectual capital and highly specialized skills, advanced scientific equipment and facilities, and computational tools not available within DoD.  Under the auspices of the JMP, the integration of DOE technologies with Joint and Individual Services’ needs has provided major advances in warfighting capabilities over many years and continues to play a crucial role in the exploration, development, and transition of new technologies needed by the Services.

The JMP has established a successful collaborative community of DoD and DOE scientists and engineers that develop technologies of interest to both Departments within a structured framework of technical reviews and scheduled milestones.  The JMP is administered and monitored by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) and reviewed annually by the Munitions Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which is comprised of munitions laboratory technical directors and senior executives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OUSD, DOE, and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  Projects are organized in five Technology Coordinating Groups (TCG) that bring together the disciplines necessary to properly evaluate technical content, relevance, and progress.  The TCGs conduct semi-annual technical peer reviews of JMP projects and plans.  DoD Service laboratory technical experts lead each of the TCGs to ensure that the technologies under development address high-priority DoD gaps, needs, and challenges.  The The JMP is a focal point for collaborative work by nearly 600 DoD and DOE scientists and engineers.  Technical leaders from both Departments consider the JMP a model of cooperation, both within their respective departments and between departments.  The highly challenging technical objectives of the 30 current projects require multi-year efforts and sustained, long-term investments to achieve success.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Munitions Program (JMP) seeks to develop technological advances in several munitions subject areas aligned with key objectives of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), namely to build a more lethal force by increasing the lethality of munitions while preparing for a sustained investment in conventional munitions technology.  These include:  1) improved modeling and simulation tools for munitions and system design and evaluation, including evaluation of lethality, vulnerability and the design of energetic materials (EM), 2) novel experimental techniques and material property databases to support modeling and simulation, 3) higher power and more thermally stable explosives, 4) miniaturized, lower-cost, and higher reliability fuzes, initiators, power systems, and sensors, 5) design tools to enable development of higher performance warheads and weapons, such as penetrators, that are hardened against high impact loads, and 6) tools to assess the health and reliability of the munitions stockpile.  The supporting experimental research requires the development of new technologies related to the synthesis, processing, formulation, and characterization of advanced munition materials, components, and systems.  This involves energetic material research, new fuzing concepts, dynamic testing of munition materials, and advanced characterization including high-rate in-situ diagnostics.

The JMP projects are divided into five technical focus areas:  1) Computational Mechanics and Material Modeling, 2) Energetic Materials, 3) Initiators, Fuzes, and Sensors, 4) Warhead and Penetration Technology, and 5) Munitions Lifecycle Technologies.

Each of the 30 projects has a detailed five year plan with objectives, tasks, deliverables and milestones that is approved annually by a group of 20-plus SES members from the DoD munitions laboratories.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Technology Watch/Horizon Scan efforts under Project code 177 were previously aligned under Program Element 0602234D8Z Project code 535 (Technical Intelligence).  This project has been administratively realigned after the reorganization of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, but the scope of work and relative funding remains unchanged.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) directly supports Strategic Intelligence and Analysis Cell (SIAC) for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) with assessments and analysis to inform the strategic direction of research, development, and acquisition of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors confronting the Unites States. Previously, the Technology Watch / Horizon Scan program was aligned under PE 0602234D8Z P525 (Office of Technical Intelligence). In FY 2021, this project has been administratively realigned after the reorganization of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, but the scope of work and relative funding remains unchanged. The analysis performed in the PE uses the operational context of Joint and cross-domain missions by leveraging Combatant Commands (COCOM) and Joint Staff warfighting concepts. Throughout this process the analysis will be tightly coupled with both the Intelligence community and the operational community through the Joint Staff. Global science and technology (S&amp;T) awareness and context is provided by the Technology Watch / Horizon Scan Program, and combined with the operational and technical analyses, informs DoD technology, engineering, and acquisition planning to inform the strategic capability development decisions of the OUSD(R&amp;E). 

Analysis and assessments are focused on challenges related to the National Defense Strategy (NDS) objectives and adversary research and development trends.  Three analysis methods are used: 1) Operational and Technical Assessments identify gaps and options to fill those gaps; 2) Technical Analysis quantifies key attributes of the challenge, assesses counter technology options, and provides an operational value assessment; and 3) the Quick Reaction Analysis Team provides quick turn analysis on emerging challenges and senior leader issues using the Federally Funded Research and Development Center/University Affiliated Research Center (FFRDC/UARC) community as performers while leveraging previous related experience and work done for the Department of Defense (DoD). Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing analytic assessments can span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. Analytic tools are developed and used to identify and track investment data to identify promising areas of capability development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Analytic Assessments Program Element (PE) directly shapes the development of innovative capabilities to meet the emerging threats from the diverse range of state and non-state actors as outlined in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. These areas include: space and terrestrial-based indications and warnings systems, integrated and resilient Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, long-range precision strike weapons, missile defense technologies, undersea systems, remotely operated vehicles and technologies, special operations forces, the Cyber Mission Force, ground systems, and other technologies related to the NDS Modernization Priorities. Due to the complexity of these challenges, the process for developing and executing these analytic assessments span fiscal years and may have multiple phases. The emerging nature of the problem sets makes specific identification of all the study projects beyond the budget year unlikely. Implementation of this process spans multiple years causing the portfolio to cascade from year-to-year.

Operational and Technical Assessments are informed by comprehensive Kill Chain Analysis (KCA) across all domains and the time continuum from 2020-2040 to identify prioritized operational issues and associated actionable technology focus areas. These products support detailed analyses and assessments to help shape technology investment decisions and inform the strategic direction of capability development. Because of the 20 year timeframe, these analyses will also help to inform requirements rather than waiting for current processes to develop them. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-Conduct KCA across NDS Scenarios and other relevant DoD Vignettes to identify and characterize capability disadvantages and opportunities across the battlespace.
-Conduct analysis on operational challenges, and existing and emerging capabilities to assess options that address those challenges within the NDS Scenarios.
-Produce operational impact assessments of potential technology improvements to military capabilities in the near, mid, and far term.
-Produce standardized technology-focused timelines to summarize and track DoD progress toward technical dominance in each of the NDS technology modernization areas.

Technical Analysis and Quick Reaction Analysis Team perform engineering level systems analysis using the DoD sponsored FFRDC/UARC and Department of Defense and Department of Energy (DoD/DoE) laboratories. Using these research performers, previously sponsored research on relevant topics is leveraged in the new research providing value and experience on new projects. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-Technical threat assessments building on intelligence community products for identifying gaps in U.S. capability for critical threats.
-Quantitative analysis of potential new technology and concepts to address capability gaps and counter emerging threat technologies.
-Independent assessment of critical capability and technology development.

Analytic Tools include modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A), computer based engineering models, to confirm theoretical performance of technical concepts. Main lines of effort include the following activities:
-Develop analytic tools to inform and provide decision support to resourcing recommendations.
-Develop strategic analytic tools enabling the analysis and evaluation of critical capability and technology development.
-Integrated MS&amp;A leveraging Service- and Agency–level virtual and constructive resources to provide insight into complex acquisition and operational decisions.

Specifically:

TW/HS Tool Exploitation: Continue to operate and improve the TW/HS capabilities.  The activities include: ability to operate and improve data analytics tool; ability to conduct two technology Horizon Scans a year; and, ability to analyze financial data from public, private, and venture capital sources to identify where both U.S. and foreign industries are investing resources in promising areas of capability development.

TW/HS Analytic Support: Continue to provide analytical and programmatic support to the TW/HS program.  The activities include: develop strategies, plans and policies to execute and manage TW/HS Tool Exploitation effort; conduct technology analyses and technology scouting to support the TW/HS program mission; and, produce technical reports and informational white papers, using TW/HS capabilities, to identify and track global technology trends to support the TW/HS program mission. Analytic support will provide a bridge between the intelligence community (IC) and the S&amp;T community to access the most relevant intelligence analysis, coordinate integration of intelligence with capability development, and conduct Red Cell assessments to inform technology investment shaping and strategic direction. An additional function will be to produce an annual S&amp;T Intelligence Needs Plan providing the IC a formal understanding of intelligence requirements for the R&amp;D community.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) supports the National Defense Strategy by accelerating the development, demonstration, and transition of capabilities that increase the lethality of the Joint Force in contested environments.  In a partnership endeavor across the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies, SCO combines capability innovation with new concepts for warfighting that leverage new technology areas, including autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  SCO conducts projects on accelerated timelines, in all warfighting domains, at any classification or access level.

The Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts Program Element supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming. Projects focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems, and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) conducts analysis to identify and accelerate the development, demonstration, and transition of potentially game-changing capabilities to shape and counter emerging threats and improve U.S. security posture.  This funding line was established in FY 2018 from transferred funds from PE 0603289D8Z / Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts, to be used for MHA related endeavors.  In a partnership endeavor across the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), the Services, the Intelligence Community (IC), and other U.S. Government agencies, SCO combines capability innovation with new concepts for warfighting that leverage new technology areas, including autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  SCO conducts projects on accelerated timelines, in all warfighting domains, at any classification or access level.

The Advanced Innovative Analysis and Concepts -MHA Program Element supports development, studies, analysis, and demonstration of integrated concepts and prototypes, analysis in support of ongoing efforts to shape and counter emerging threats, cross-Service and cross-Defense/Intelligence concepts, and red-teaming. Projects focus on proving component and subsystem maturity prior to integration in major systems, and may involve risk reduction initiatives. Due to the nature of these projects, specific applications and detailed plans are available at a higher classification level.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Program Element (PE) 0603338D8Z Defense Modernization and Prototyping (DM&amp;P) is a new PE in FY 2021.  This PE consolidates all funding and project investment areas previously supported by PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD), PE 0603826D8Z Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP), and PE 0604132D8Z Missile Defeat Project.  DM&amp;P provides the funding focus and visibility for USD(R&amp;E) to select projects critical for DOD modernization, and initiate them in the year of execution, thereby accelerating the delivery of joint mission capabilities to the warfighter and ensuring technical overmatch in peer engagements.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, the Defense Modernization and Prototyping (DM&amp;P) Program Element (PE) supports the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) with innovation-focused experimentation and prototyping to deliver joint mission capabilities to the warfighter at the speed of relevance.  DM&amp;P’s mission-focused capabilities cross functional domains and enhance warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  DM&amp;P funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for concept of operations (CONOPs) development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  The DM&amp;P PE enables the USD(R&amp;E) vision for next generation platforms, weapons systems, fire control, sensors, logistics, and communications.  The consolidated nature of the DM&amp;P PE increases the Department’s ability to coordinate activities across the Services, Defense Agencies, and international partners; provides the agility to rapidly pivot to new threats; and, supplies the resources necessary to ensure a technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department’s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy. 

DM&amp;P prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for capabilities addressing modernization challenges.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, DM&amp;P matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and the Combatant Commands’ Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).  The DM&amp;P PE supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new joint mission capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD), 2) Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP), 3) Red Teaming, and 4) Time Sensitive Target Defeat (TSTD).  Completed DM&amp;P projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations.

The DM&amp;P PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that enabled ECTD and QRSP to quickly and effectively respond to emergent innovation opportunities through the rapid development and transition of risk reducing prototypes.  DM&amp;P prototyping activities include initial concept discovery of potentially game-changing capabilities through relatively low cost risk reducing prototypes; and, high-fidelity prototyping of advanced systems in partnership with the Services, Defense Agencies, and allies to inform the acquisition of new joint mission capabilities though experimentation and red teaming.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) funds the development of risk-reducing prototypes, experiments, and demonstrations to expedite delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed joint mission capabilities to the warfighter.  These lower-cost prototypes and QRSP’s innovative business processes give the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) the agility to quickly explore new, higher-risk technology areas that have the potential for immediate, game-changing impacts.  Developed prototypes inform modernization efforts or transition through rapid technology refresh and insertion into joint mission capabilities.  QRSP also enables the DoD to identify innovated solutions from small and non-traditional business not normally engaged by the DoD to address gaps and augment joint mission capabilities. Project selection is guided by department-level strategies and priorities, such as the DoD’s modernization areas and the National Defense Strategy.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and deliver affordable capabilities faster than standard acquisition cycles.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, QRSP matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  

QRSP includes thrust areas that complement risk-reducing prototypes, such as Strategic Multi-layer Assessments (SMA) and joint demonstrations and experiments. SMA supports senior leadership in the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) by providing rapid, actionable assessments of complex operational and technical challenges.  Joint demonstrations and DM&amp;P-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  Demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on innovative small and non-traditional businesses; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  Individual projects generally span 6 to 18 months, typically at a cost of less than $1.000 million.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) funding supports the USD(R&amp;E) mission to accelerate the development and fielding of overmatch capabilities to the warfighter in coordination with the Services, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and Joint Staff. Prototyping and experimentation activities focus on key Defense modernization challenges in mission areas identified by the Joint Staff and USD(R&amp;E) leadership.  ECTD leverages rapid prototyping processes to include Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) and Other Transition Authorities (OTA) that seek to demonstrate a novel technology or concept in a relevant environment within a 30-month period then transition it to an operational user. ECTD activities refine future warfighting concepts, inform Service Program of Record (PoR) capability requirements, and provide residual joint mission capability through leave behind test articles.  

Anticipated FY 2021 investments areas target the following key mission areas: Advanced Electronic Warfare (EW); Fully Networked Command, Control, and Communication (FNC3); Joint Fires and Targeting; Contested Logistics Operations; and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) to support Time-Critical Targeting.  Projects will be identified through soliciting concepts from Service, CCMDs, industry, academia, Federally Funded Research &amp; Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Department of Defense laboratories.  Efforts are designed to encourage teaming between organizations to generate integrated concepts that result in leap-ahead mission capabilities. This process also focuses related Service and Defense Agency projects to a common set of gaps addressing peer engagements.  Individual projects generally span one to three years, typically at a cost of less than $15.000 million.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, and experiments enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enabling a kill chain against a near peer competitor to maintain persistence on time sensitive targets present challenges.  Time Sensitive Target Defeat (TSTD) leverages the recommendations of Special Program Missile Defeat (SPMD) JUKEBOX 18 by establishing an Integrated Joint Combined Arms Demonstration Campaign to address the challenging mission and national security needs for countering time sensitive targeting.  The Demonstration Campaign is a multi-year initiative to integrating a multi-domain concept to address the critical needs for countering time sensitive targets.  By forging a coalition with external and allied partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom), the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) will execute a live demonstration of time critical targeting to improve tactics, techniques, and procedures while improving the operational planning and effectiveness of the find, fix, and kill chains of future Joint Warfighting Concepts.  TSTD will establish the foundation for resolving challenges with future weapon systems and command and control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Time Sensitive Target Defeat (TSTD) integrates a multi-domain TSTD initiative to decrease the kill chain execution timeline for mission enduring capability by integrating the Department’s modernization prototype initiatives to enable the find, fix, and kill Joint Warfighting Concepts.  TSTD will establish an Integrated Joint Combined Arms Demonstration Campaign Plan to demonstrate a live multi-domain kill chains across land, air, sea, cyberspace, and space as operationally feasible.  The objectives are to acquire, demonstrate, and deliver prototype capabilities to close existing time sensitive targeting (TST) kill chains by enhancing their ability to degrade, counter, or defeat adversarial intent.  To increase mission success, TSTD will increase technical rigor by imposing a Government Reference Architecture (GRA) standard to devolve technical requirements of the prototypes and identify promising solutions that will enhance the TST kill chains of the Joint Warfighting Concepts.

The TSTD objectives:
-	Conduct a live time critical targeting demonstration via the Integrated Joint Combined Arms Demonstration Campaign
-	Establish an allied partnership to enable a participation within the Demonstration Campaigns
-	Develop and demonstrate prototyping capabilities to close existing TST kill webs
-	Conduct sensor payload integration to increase persistence and enable long range fires
-	Integration of new Command and Control (C2) architectures 
-	Provide an execution path to transition prototypes as a "leave-behind capability."   
-	Incorporate Rapid Integration Strategy for Experimentation/Prototypes (RISE) to integrate into the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLP-F) for transitioning or leave behind capabilities
-	Define the pathways to incorporate cyber and electronic warfare into the multi-domain concept of TSTD</r2:Text>

The project helps to assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and newly developed systems, and helps identify unanticipated disruptive opportunities and technological dead ends.  The project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform requirements, develop new concepts of operations (CONOPS), and help accelerate technology acquisition pathways for joint missions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Red Teaming to Support DoD Modernization Priorities funds efforts to explore new joint mission capabilities in a competitive environment.  Efforts include: 1.) Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies, including current DoD investments and external technologies, to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2.) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstrations, experiments, and CONOPS earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3.) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current DoD and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterizations of future prototypes, requirement definitions, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures that could be taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The USD(R&amp;E) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new CONOPS.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2017, Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was transferred from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS)  (PE 0603342D8W).  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY 2020, DIU funding transferred from WHS PE 0603342D8W to OSD PE 0603342D8Z consistent with the realignment and establishment of USD(Research &amp; Engineering), and disestablishment of USD(Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics).  In FY 2018 and FY 2019, this program had $23.498 million and $29.198 million, respectively, in PE 0603342D8W.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict.  DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter.  Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016. 

The DIU mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and DoD in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority.  Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 OMB/OSTP research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.  The DIU program will find and provide access to leading-edge technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.   Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of technological breakthroughs and innovations originating from within the Department. In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging technologies that will be a source of battlefield advantage, when integrated with military systems and novel concepts of operation.

Leveraging innovative technologies from both defense and commercial sources, to include non-traditional sources such as startup companies, has the potential to rapidly address warfighter problem sets in areas where commercial innovation outstrips government investment in the same technology areas.  This funding will be used to mature and demonstrate emerging technologies, such as the Department’s Modernization Technology Areas, that contribute to the broader joint mission needs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program focuses on rapid innovation and demonstration with emerging technology to address priority warfighter problem sets and National Defense Strategy technology focus areas.  By leveraging Service activities and establishing partnerships with other government agencies (OGAs) such as the Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Homeland Security, a wide variety of emerging military and commercial technologies are rapidly assessed for applicability to the National Defense Strategy technology focus areas and a broad spectrum of priority DoD problem sets.  Enabling the warfighter to execute short duration pilots with these emerging technologies provides a cost effective way to leverage commercial investment for DoD purposes, sharing costs with OGA partners, informing warfighter requirements for follow-on acquisition through traditional DoD channels, and allowing other DoD R&amp;D organizations to focus their resources on both the integration of commercial technologies showing promise in these warfighter pilots as well as on traditional R&amp;D in technologies not well served by commercial start-up companies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) environment (EME) is the largest and most complex warfighting environment because it is universally pervasive, largely unseen and can only be perceived through the use of advanced electronics technologies.  Understanding and managing EME warfighting challenges is essential to all military operations because it is through the use of EMS technologies that we perceive operational realities – the state and disposition of all military and nonmilitary groups/forces − and coordinate all actions of our military forces.  

Historically, the United States has had technological advantages in EME warfighting technologies (i.e., sensors, communications and countermeasures), however, this is no longer the case in many technology areas due to the broad proliferation of advanced technologies, the rapid commercialization of advanced electronic systems and components and the concurrent rise of cyber-related technologies.  Leveraging these advanced technologies, adversaries are developing and fielding competing and asymmetric capabilities to offset past U.S. advantages.  Their efforts are making U.S. operations in the EMS and cyberspace significantly more difficult, and they are doing these things at accelerating rates.  Their developments include new generations of challenging threats ranging from small unmanned air systems and easily transportable Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) to dedicated military systems incorporating the most advanced sensing, communication and electronic warfare (EW) technologies such as integrated air defense systems and increasingly capable cruise and ballistic missiles. 

The accelerating rate at which new EMS and cyber threats are appearing demands much faster responses than traditional Department of Defense (DoD) research, development and acquisition (RD&amp;A) processes can provide.  Concurrently, the effective operational lifetime of many advanced technology solutions is decreasing due to the accelerating pace of technological innovation.  For these reasons, we must begin developing technological solutions much quicker and at much lower costs.

The Joint Electronic Advanced Technology (JEAT) Program was established to address these challenges through efforts designed to substantially accelerate the development and transition of innovative technology solutions to EMS warfighting challenges.  To do this, the JEAT program rapidly identifies, explores, develops, matures and demonstrates technologies and approaches that fall outside the Services’ purviews.  By using both off-the-shelf and new military and commercial technologies in innovative ways, JEAT’s approach has enabled needed capabilities to be delivered to the warfighter much sooner than possible by traditional DoD approaches and have also resulted in substantial savings for the Department in both research and development (R&amp;D) and in Programs of Record.

Beginning in FY 2020, all JEAT work has been moved into Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation.  Project 619, EW and Non-Kinetic Effects Experimentation and Oversight, was terminated and the efforts previously conducted within in Project 619 were moved into Project 245. 

PROJECT 619, EW AND NON-KINETIC EFFECTS EXPERIMENTATION AND OVERSIGHT

Project 619 previously included three efforts: Experimentation/Demonstration, Advanced Technology Development/Verification and EW Enterprise Collaboration and Planning.  All Project 619 efforts were moved into Project 245 in FY 2020.

PROJECT 245, EW ENTERPRISE EXPLORATION AND INNOVATION (EW E&amp;I)

EW E&amp;I identifies, explores, develops and rapidly matures and demonstrates EMS and hybrid electronic warfare (EW)-Cyber warfighting technology solutions at rates that are significantly faster than traditional Department developmental efforts and at much lower costs.  To do this, a thorough understanding of all the EMS and EW-Cyber challenges confronting warfighters and technology developers is foundational.  Knowledge of all of the efforts to mitigate these challenges is also essential.  Utilizing this knowledge, innovative potential technology solutions that fall outside the Services’ purviews are identified and developed in state-of-the-art laboratory environments.  Promising potential solutions are then validated by fully exploring them side-by-side with existing capabilities and other potential technology solutions in real-world experimentation environments under real-world conditions.  To provide the greatest possible insights, these experimentation environments are designed so that they are operationally realistic − utilizing the most realistic threats available − and environmentally realistic – utilizing near-real-world EMS environments.  The knowledge gained through EW E&amp;I efforts accelerates the transition of capabilities to the warfighter and informs senior leaders so they can more effectively oversee and direct all Department EW and EW-Cyber developmental efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 245, EW Enterprise Exploration and Innovation (EW E&amp;I), identifies, explores, develops and rapidly matures and demonstrates EMS and hybrid electronic warfare (EW)-Cyber warfighting technology solutions at rates that are significantly faster than traditional Department developmental efforts and at much lower costs.  Maintaining awareness of all EW and EW-Cyber research and development (R&amp;D) efforts globally enables the selection of internal JEAT development efforts and provides analyses and insights for senior decision-makers to ensure effective direction of all Department EW and EW-Cyber technology programs and processes.  Internal JEAT developmental efforts investigate and mature technologies and approaches to counter advanced EMS threats in innovative ways and enable the development of compelling new warfighting technologies.  JEAT’s large-scale open-air, dynamic field experimentation venues explore and validate promising potential technology solutions side-by-side with existing and other developmental technologies to provide the greatest possible insights to senior leaders directing the Department’s EW and EW-Cyber capabilities development efforts.  Current and future experimentation venues will be selected, designed and directed within EW E&amp;I but funding for the execution of them will be provided by Program Element 0603699D8Z, Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.

Understanding.  EW E&amp;I “understanding” efforts maintain awareness of all EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D efforts globally.  In addition to guiding internal JEAT development efforts, they also provide analyses and technology deep dives to give key insights to senior decision-makers so they can effectively direct all Department EW and EW-Cyber technology development programs and processes.

Identifying and Developing Innovative Solutions.  These efforts investigate and mature technologies and approaches to counter advanced EMS threats in innovative ways and develop new overmatch technologies.  They develop, mature and demonstrate new EW and EW-Cyber technologies in state-of-the-art laboratory environments and include, e.g., the development and validation of new EW countermeasures and nonkinetic battle management technologies to vastly simplify operational planning and decision-making for EMS operations.

Exploring Potential Solutions.  The JEAT Program developed and continues to pioneer the use of large-scale open-air, dynamic field experimentation venues as powerful tools for technology discovery and maturation.  These overwhelmingly successful venues firmly established this type of experimentation as an invaluable tool for both technology acceleration and cost savings.  Current and future experimentation venues will be selected, designed and directed within this effort but funding for the execution of them will be provided by Program Element 0603699D8Z, Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Understanding.  To maintain awareness of the global state of EW and EW-Cyber technology development, this effort coordinates and oversees all EMS warfare-related R&amp;D activities within the Department and manages R&amp;D activities within OUSD(R&amp;E).  Work within this effort includes:
• Maintaining cognizance of all EW capabilities and capability development efforts worldwide.
• Overseeing all EW and EW-Cyber related R&amp;D activities across DoD.
• Exploring new and innovative EMS technologies and approaches and advocating their development and adoption.
• Coordinating Department EW and EW-Cyber-related R&amp;D, protocols, and policy efforts.
• Analyzing requisite development and operational interfaces across DoD and with international partners.
• Reporting relevant information to senior leaders, across the Department and to Congress and other external groups.
• Providing recommendations for development and acquisition programs that address EW- and EW-Cyber-related threats impacting sensors, seekers, communications, platform survivability, countermeasures, and EMS battle management.  
• Providing technical and analytic support to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) on Programs of Record, Joint Urgent Operational Needs and efforts involving technology maturity and availability, critical program information standards, foreign disclosure, and technical signals requirements.
• Conducting deep dives and analyses of technological opportunities and advanced threats to support Departmental EW and EW-Cyber R&amp;D efforts.

Identifying and Developing Innovative Solutions.  Efforts include:
• Identifying, developing and integrating advanced technologies to synergistically create EW and EW-Cyber effects that are far greater than the sum of the constituent systems.
• Identifying and developing nearer term, lower cost, and more effective EW and EW-Cyber technology solutions.
• Conducting R&amp;D within JEAT’s Distributed Electronic Effects Delivery (DEED) Laboratory.
• Developing and validating prototypes of promising technology solutions within JEAT’s DEED Laboratory. 
• Integrating prototypes into unmanned vehicles for further exploration and assessment in experimentation venues.
• Conducting collaborative R&amp;D efforts with the Services, Combatant Commands and the Intelligence Community (IC) to explore, integrate and demonstrate enhanced real-time EMS/Cyberspace situational awareness and battle management technologies within the Digital Attack Surface Execution Environment (DASEE) effort.  DASEE leverages state-of-the-art computational and perception technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, graph analytics, advanced heuristics and cognition/visualization also provide predictive analytics and course of action development.  

Exploring Potential Solutions.  The JEAT team is DoD’s acknowledged expert in designing and conducting large-scale open air field experimentation venues.  JEAT’s experimentation venues are selected and scoped to explore technology solutions to some of the most difficult operational challenges facing U.S. warfighters.  JEAT’s experimentation venues are designed to simultaneously examine numerous developmental and existing technologies side-by-side under the same conditions and they utilize realistic threats and real-world EMS environments to provide the greatest insights to operators, developers and decision-makers.  Leveraging JEAT’s history of conducting highly successful experimentation venues, SILENT HAMMER (SH) is our current multi-year, multi-agency series of field experimentation venues and the first SH venue, SH 1, was conducted in late FY 2019.  Beginning in FY 2020, funding to conduct JEAT’s experimentation venues will be provided by PE 0603699D8Z, Emerging Capabilities Technology Development.
• Exploring, maturing and assessing technologies and approaches for multi-platform, multi-aperture, multi-domain (M3) engagement of passive/active sensing architectures in very complex and highly congested EMS environments.    
• Selecting, scoping, designing and conducting subsequent experimentation venues.  As with earlier JEAT experimentation venues, warfighters and the EW and Cyber Communities of Interest and Executive Committees are involved in this process to ensure their maximum relevance and value to both warfighters and technology developers.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program conducts prototype demonstrations and experiments to address Combatant Commands' (CCMDs), and Joint Service urgent and emergent warfighting needs.  The program delivers developmental and operational prototypes, generally within two to four years, culminating in a sponsored military utility assessment (MUA), thus enabling scale-up of science and technology from the laboratories into defense acquisition programs.  The key tenets of the JCTD program are to fulfill national objectives to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and enable the DoD to achieve greater performance and affordability.  Following the Undersecretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E))'s Modernization Priority guidance, mission focused areas were co-developed with the Joint Staff to address the Chairman's gap assessment which include, but are not limited to: time-sensitive targeting (TST), advanced electronic warfare (AEW), integrated fires (IF), and fully networked command, control and communications (FNC3).

The JCTD program achieves its objectives by engaging the CCMDs, the Joint Services, interagency, international, and non-governmental partners to expand the DoD's access to prototyping and innovation.  JCTDs serve as a vehicle primarily for CCMDs to address the Joint force's strategic priority mission areas that present significant risk and suffer from inadequate investment.  JCTDs often address technology needs that fall into the seams between the urgent/emergent needs of CCMDs and Title-10 functions of the Military Services.  Subsequently, JCTD investments are further informed by the CCMDs' integrated priority list, the capability gaps assessed through the Joint Staff, and the Military Services' science and technology roadmaps to achieve warfighter dominance.  As U.S. and partner nations are increasingly orienting toward peer competition in contested environments across multiple, inter-dependent domains, and where feasible through CCMD’s sponsorship, the JCTD program looks to deliver leap-ahead operational capability in reduced time with the coordination of allied research and development (R&amp;D) funding, technology, and industry participation.  The value proposition is to affordably operationalize technologies more quickly, that enable Joint/Combined forces to access novel/leap-ahead capabilities.

JCTD outcomes are designed to accelerate technology transition by evaluating and demonstrating prototyped technologies in operationally relevant environments.  Based on the results of the MUA performed under the cognizance of a CCMD sponsor, the products of a JCTD are "left behind" for additional assessment or operational use, transitioned to a program of record (PoR), or returned to the technical baseline inventory for further development.  The JCTD program uses MUAs to further inform acquisition pathways to field initial capabilities faster, or prompt major acquisition program decisions prior to milestone A or B approvals.  Therefore, the JCTD program serves as a technology catalyst and transition-bridge between the USD(R&amp;E) and the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)) offices. 

In FY 2019, the JCTD program successfully completed four MUAs and transitioned ten JCTD prototypes.  Nine JCTDs transitioned all or select components to new or existing PoRs, and one operational prototype was directly fielded and is being sustained by non-JCTD funds in operational theaters.  Since the JCTD Program was reframed in 2006, it has executed 116 prototyping projects.  The historical transition rate for the JCTD program is 84 percent, including: 63 prototypes (54 percent) transitioning to a PoR; 29 prototypes (26 percent) providing "leave-behind" assets for operational fielding; and five (5) prototypes (4 percent) placed on the General Services Administration schedule.  The remaining 19 prototypes (16 percent) were returned to the technical base for further development or were terminated.  Overall, the JCTD program has directly supported multiple key operations by rapidly accelerating the fielding of game changing technologies and capabilities into the hands of the Joint Warfighter.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Under C-WOLF directly supports the National Defense Strategy's focus to develop resilient and federated communication and information systems from the tactical to the strategic level.  Under C-WOLF provides stealthy and low-latency, optical laser communications (OCOMMS) between undersea systems and air platforms.  Using low probability of intercept/low probability of detection technology, the Under C-WOLF JCTD accomplished this by exploiting the air-water-interface (AWI) OCOMMS system and the all-through-water (ATW) OCOMMS system to operate at tactically useful bandwidths, depths, and ranges.  The bandwidth for the AWI OCOMMS system provides real-time command and control capability to the submarine.  The bandwidth for the ATW OCOMMS system allows an unmanned underwater vehicle to provide results of extensive surveys to a submarine.  Both systems together increase operational effectiveness of underwater communications in a radio frequency denied, degraded, or contested area, particularly in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command areas of responsibility.</r2:Description>

The three programs are (1) CCMD direct liaison support, (2) JCTD pre-transition and (3) Program Integration Office for execution of select, classified projects.  (1) CCMD direct liaison support: The CCMDs are essential in specifying capability needs, project identification, demonstration venues, military utility assessment, and transition of JCTDs.  The JCTD program provides direct support to CCMDs enabling them to provide an on-site JCTD operational manager.  (2) JCTD pre-transition: In some cases, Service or Agency partner transition funding is not available for one to two years following the JCTD demonstration phase.  In such cases, where there is a clear transition and the need to sustain the capability for a short time prior to availability of Service or Agency transition funds, the JCTD pre-transition funds may be used to meet that need.  (3) Program Integration Office: Executes a select number of highly classified projects in areas such as electronic miniaturization, electronic countermeasures, advanced mobile ad hoc network communications, space situational awareness intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, sensor platforms and communications, and persistence surveillance.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful JCTDs can transition to acquisition via one of several methods:
-  The JCTD addresses a documented capability gap in an existing program of record (PoR).  The existing PoR can acquire, further mature, sustain, and provide the capability under existing program documentation.
-  The capabilities address capability gaps that naturally fit with an existing PoR, but program documentation addressing the new capabilities does not exist.  In these cases, existing PoR documentation (such as the capabilities development document (CDD) or capabilities production document (CPD)) is revised to include the new capabilities from the JCTD, and the JCTD capabilities transition to the PoR.
-  The capabilities address a current operational need without requiring PoR changes.  In these cases, the JCTD capabilities may transition directly to operational use, with sustainment (operations and maintenance) funding arranged through the gaining command.  
- The results of JCTD can be used to inform research and engineering, or validate a joint requirement per the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System.  This includes identification of the need through development of an initial capability description (ICD) document or accelerating the development of a CDD or CPD to establish a new PoR.
- The capabilities may be widely applicable commodity products, useful to many commands.  In these cases, the commodity products are listed on General Services Administration schedule, and made available for purchase by any commands needing the capability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

Department of Defense (DoD) advances in smart sensors and smart weapons have an urgent need for more resilient networks than the tactical data links of today.  In FY 2016, the Network Communications Capability Program (NCCP) returned with a new focus on developing enabling technologies for Joint assured communications networks.  The goals of this program are: to mitigate degradation across battlespace tiers and domains, and to provide agility that will support the mission needs of Joint Functional Component Commanders, Joint Force Commanders, and deployed forces.

The DoD’s current TDLs platforms and capabilities are not sufficiently protected from emerging adversary threats and contain insufficient capacity for future needs.  In order to enable the promise of net-centric operations for the warfighter, the next generation of airborne, surface, and ground tactical networks must provide greater affordability, higher network capacity, greater durability against electronic attack, better network connectivity, and faster response times to the changing demands from airborne, maritime, and ground users.  Many line-of-sight (LOS), beyond LOS, and SATCOM waveforms have been integrated onto platforms for various missions.  These waveforms necessarily exhibit tradeoffs in target performance attributes including capacity, latency, protection, and complexity.  As a result, no single waveform capability will be able to satisfy all emerging mission needs emphasizing the need for interoperability and software-defined waveforms.  The challenge is to understand the essential needs of the users, avoid needless redundancy, develop affordable capabilities, and integrate separate capabilities into a cohesive network.  This research will develop transformative technologies to ensure performance in contested A2/AD environments by focusing on future communications networks that are a “leap ahead” of today’s capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In a contested environment, especially when conducting forward operations, platforms face a significant electronic warfare threat.  The primary threat is from advanced jamming, signal collection, and geolocation techniques that are rapidly evolving to become more capable and agile.  DoD advances in smart sensors and weapons demand robust tactical waveforms and networks with greater capacity but lower cost than communication links of today.

The Future Autonomous Battlespace Radio Frequency with Integrated Communications (FABRIC) program is developing next-generation communications-layer architecture for tactical networks for operations in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat environments.  This architecture will deliver capacity and affordability to enable future smart sensors and smart weapons.  The network architecture is flexible enough to support Commander’s Intent in any mission, environment, operating tactical platform, and weapon system under various threat conditions.  FABRIC’s efforts focus on developing advanced component technologies, such as Anti-Jam (AJ), Low Probability of Intercept (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD) waveforms; adaptive antenna technologies (transmit/receive/nulling);  cyber hardening; and advanced routing to ensure Quality of Service..

Based on the developed thresholds and objectives for the required network architecture, the specific advanced component technologies were prioritized and form the foundation of the FABRIC design.  Through simulation and field experimentation, FABRIC is verifying the technology in operationally relevant environments against representative threats, and facilitates the migration and transition of these technologies to service platforms, radios, and other combat mission systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>America Makes’ mission is to accelerate the adoption of Additive Manufacturing in the United States industrial base.  Additive manufacturing (i.e., “3D printing”) is a process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodologies such as traditional machining.  Additive manufacturing is benefitting the DoD by enabling lifecycle cost savings and enhanced capabilities including: distributing supply chains to get the right part in the right place at the right time, improving mission readiness by producing work aids in sustainment depots and replacing long-lead time and out of production spares, and by enhancing lethality through production of lighter weight and higher performing parts than could be achieved with traditional manufacturing.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>The major areas of emphasis for the eight DoD led manufacturing innovation institutes are:
1. Qualification and certification of additive manufacturing (AM) materials, processes, and parts, together with rigorous training and workforce development that enables DoD to further integrate AM technologies into their depots, arsenals, and shipyards to modernize their supply chains and strengthen their position.
2. Mature technology to institutionalize the digital thread across DoD manufacturing enterprises by enabling the modernization of DoD assets, lowering barriers to virtual prototyping and validation; accelerating the innovation cycle; generating dynamic responses to material needs; and lowering total system lifecycle costs form design thorough disposal.  Develop tools to assist small and medium size companies for manufacturing cybersecurity.
3. Mature innovative metal lightweighting technologies across all platforms and services that save fuel and increase combat payload. Investments would address both targeted application spaces and cross-cutting enabling technologies.  This includes activity in linear friction welding; design and manufacturing methods for promising high strength alloys; develop lightweight engineered structures; optimize ultra-fast heat treatment and quenching and extend the use of thin-walled casting technology to cast components for military vehicles.
4. Utilize the existing world-class 300mm integrated silicon photonics foundry in Albany, NY, the indium phosphide photonics foundry in Silicon Valley, and the world’s first photonic integrated circuit test, assembly, and packaging facility in Rochester, NY to accelerate low cost, volume manufacturing of devices for LIDAR, 5G telecom, and quantum dot lasers and the integration of advanced assembly and packaging techniques for optical elements. 
5. Mature flexible hybrid technology to support a supply chain that can produce electronics on flexible, stretchable, and 3-dimensional structures. This will create new innovative products that can be used for warfighter wearable health sensors, portable x-ray imagers, precision navigation timing packages and phased array antennas for electronic warfare and radar systems.
6. Mature the manufacturing processes that will enable industry to produce and use smart fibers and textiles and incorporated them into innovative products using conventional weaving and knitting equipment. Advanced fabric technology offers unique solutions to critical national security challenges, including soldier communication systems; functional composite materials for ground and air vehicles; and distinctive undersea and space capabilities.  Through the recently created Defense Fabric Discovery Center continue to develop a fabric-based solutions in Free Space Optical Communications (Identification Friend/Foe (IFF)) that eliminates issues of detection and jamming and is affordable and easily deployable.
7. Mature the technology for large scale, cost-effective, reproducible manufacturing of high-quality tissues that can be used to treat severely wounded warfighters, which contributes to force readiness and saves lives on the battlefield.  This includes (1) cell selection, culture and scale-up, (2) biomaterial selection and scale-up, (3) tissue process automation and monitoring, (4) tissue maturing technologies, and (5) tissue preservation and transport.
8. Accelerate research, development, and implementation of collaborative robotic technologies for use in manufacturing. Early use include smart companion robots for vehicle assembly, perception-aided collaborative robotic wire harness assembly, robot assistance for composites manufacturing, and robotic sanding and finishing. The focus is on (1) Versatility — robots that can perform a variety of tasks; (2) Flexibility — robots that can be deployed and re-deployed rapidly and easily; (3) Lower cost — reducing the overall cost of robot systems; and (4) Collaboration — robots that safely work alongside and with people.

The executing military department or agency, in close and continuous coordination with OSD ManTech, publishes a formal solicitation (funding opportunity announcement) for proposals describing the scope of required activities and extensive proposal evaluation criteria. Non-Profit Organizations (including universities) are eligible to bid, and each bidder forms a broad consortium of industry and academic partners. The executing military department or agency, in close coordination with OSD, uses a team of government experts to evaluate each proposal against the evaluation criteria and selects a winning consortium. The final terms of the cooperative agreement/technology investment agreement between the selectee and the federal government are then negotiated and the CA or TIA is signed. Throughout and after completion of this process, the federal government makes clear that members of non-selected teams are encouraged to join the selected consortium as conditions permit.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MD5 National Security Technology Accelerator (MD5) is a program office within the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) that seeks to develop deep partnerships between the Department of Defense (DoD) and non-traditional thought partners, including colleges and universities, the entrepreneurial community and disruptive innovators within DoD itself. The speed and reactivity of the modern technology-threat environment challenge the traditional top-down model of defense problem-solving and capability development. Mitigating this deficiency requires developing internal workforce and organizational competencies and associated resources related to problem framing, knowledge and resource sharing, and non-traditional partnerships. Consistent with guidance from the Secretary of Defense and new Defense Innovation Initiative (DII), MD5 is a portfolio of innovation programs that (1) accelerates capability development leveraging non-traditional collaborators and “bottom-up” approaches, (2) augments the defense industry through the creation of startup businesses, and (3) enhances the DOD workforce through critical innovation skills development.

This program seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the US military over adversaries by tapping into high-potential uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD (i.e. intrapreneurs) and increasing their interactions with high-speed innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD. This is accomplished by providing training and tools to these DoD intrapreneurs that empower them to find new ways to identify, frame, and solve problems as well as opening avenues to broadly implement the solutions they create. Additionally, the programs executed create opportunities for external innovators and entrepreneurs to be exposed to DoD problems and allow them to demonstrate possible solutions they can bring to bear on problems.

MD5/NSTA carries out its mission via three portfolios of effort: Education, Collaboration, and Acceleration. MD5 education and training programs develop DOD and industry personnel educated to continuously test and improve legacy processes and systems. MD5 collaboration programs like crowdsourcing develop human-centered networks that address DOD capability needs in an agile, cost-effective manner. MD5 acceleration programs develop ventures inside and outside of DOD that develop, commercialize, or apply technology relevant to warfighter problem sets.

MD5 is a Congressional interest program that has received funding in FY 2016 ($5M), FY 2017 ($25M), FY 2018 ($25.5M), and FY 2019 ($15M).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The MD5 mission is to develop “bottom-up” innovation as a core Department of Defense (DoD) competence
that complements the traditional defense industrial base and Research, Development, Technology and Engineering (RDT&amp;E) enterprise.

Education Portfolio
The Education Portfolio programs contribute to workforce development by cultivating innovators and entrepreneurs inside DoD who are adept at creative problem solving, the development of innovative approaches and technologies, and venture formation that will improve national security, as well as deliver economic and social value.
• “Boot Camps” are 4-day short courses that provide military organizations the opportunity to address some of their most pressing challenges in new ways. In the course, participants are instructed on topics related to innovation and intrapreneurship (including human centered design, lean methodology, technology literacy, and psychology of innovation) and taught to apply these skills to a set of command-sponsored problem topics. By the end, participants will have developed initial concepts to address these problem topics.
• “Startup Innovation Fellowship (SIF)” is a 6-week fellowship opportunity for service members and civilians to be embedded in private companies to learn best practices in critical areas such as data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cyber security, logistics, rapid prototyping, etc. that can be brought back into the DoD.

Collaboration Portfolio 
The Collaboration Portfolio programs connect communities of innovators around problems and technologies relevant to national security to enable formation of new ventures.
• “Hacks” exposes college students and local ventures to DoD customer problems over a 48 hour period and aims to provide MVP or low-TRL solutions through one of two channels: formation of a venture and/or direct solution adoption by the problem sponsor.
• “Hacking for Defense (H4D)” exposes college students to DoD customer problems over an academic semester and aims to provide MVP solutions through one of three channels: formation of a venture; direct solution adoption by the problem sponsor; or reframing the original problem.
• “Source” invites bottom-up, ‘deckplate’ innovation from inside a military formation by providing either new solutions and novel applications directly to leadership from a sponsoring command.
• “Catalyst” exposes local ventures to DoD customer problems over a 6-18month period and aims to provide high-TRL solutions for immediate adoption by the problem sponsor or a DoD contracting entity (e.g., DIUx).

Acceleration Portfolio
The Acceleration Portfolio programs grow and mature civil-military technology ventures by ensuring that innovators can access critical resources, including design and engineering support, mentorship services, and commercial and DoD research and development infrastructure to build, test, and enhance venture concepts.
• “Maker” provides facilities, access, materials, and training to entrepreneurs to fabricate, develop, and facilitate rapid prototyping of their technology. These more refined prototypes can further help DoD in deciding whether to commit more resources to a product. Primary capability located at Eagle Maker Hub at USM and Lincoln Lab at MIT. Also planning pilot with Idea Forge at CU Boulder.
• “Fed Tech” pairs cutting edge inventor teams and technologies from the United States federal government laboratory system with highly qualified entrepreneurs to conduct customer discovery and build business models. The program leverages lean startup techniques, while also focusing on the unique aspects of turning a federally funded technology into a startup company. The program is split into two phases: Phase 1 – Startup Studio focuses on technology selection and team formation; Phase 2 – Pre-Accelerator is a deeper dive with the best teams from Phase 1 to focus on building a company around the technology.
• “MD5 Starts” is a format for showcasing early stage startups who are working on technologies and products that are pursuing a dual-use market strategy. MD5 acts as a facilitator and convener amongst the ecosystem actors in a local geography, from incubator and accelerator programs, to research universities, startups and local or regional economic development organizations. 
The goal of the event is to showcase the great economic opportunity that exists in building companies that have both great market potential and which address important and urgent needs of national security and defense.
• “Hatch” helps entrepreneurs/teams with an idea (i.e., from H4D) learn how to form and build a venture using industry best practices. The initial pilot is with the Founder Institute incubator program where MD5 candidates will participate.
• “Propel” provides companies that have prototypes or initial customers with world-class education, mentorship, and relevant business connections to prepare the venture for scale while elevating their visibility in the venture community. The initial pilots of this program are with TechStars and MassChallenge. This program envisions feeding from Hacks and H4D.
• “Gauge” provides facilities, access, materials, and training to entrepreneurs to develop, iterate, and refine their technology up to TRL 6/7. Also provide access to test and development ranges.
• “Launch” identifies existing government technology that can be applied to a stated customer problem or problem set and to then work with a team on a path to commercialize that technology.
• “Boost” provides opportunities for companies to secure early, non-dilutive government funding in the form of grants or contracts.  This program will rely on the use of Small Business Innovation Research grants/contracts.
• “Bridge” provides founding teams with mentors and advisors who can help them in business, customer, and product
development by providing the right advice and insights at the right time.

Platform
• “Defense Innovation Network” is the online platform (currently www.md5.net) that MD5 is developing to facilitate gathering ideas and building a network of DoD innovators both inside and outside of the DoD. This platform is used for both the Hacks and Source.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2021, all funding and project investment areas in the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) will transition to PE 0603338D8Z Defense Modernization and Prototyping (DM&amp;P).  The new PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that have allowed ECTD to rapidly and effectively develop and transition capabilities to respond to emergent issues, time-sensitive threats, and innovation opportunities.  Through consolidation, the DM&amp;P PE increases the Department’s ability to coordinate activities across the Services and Defense Agencies, reduces duplication of effort, enables rapid pivots to new threats, and provides the resources necessary to ensure a technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department’s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy.   

Emerging Capabilities Technology Development funds rapid prototyping efforts and experimentation in collaboration with the Services, government labs, academia, allied partner nations, and industry to support the National Defense Strategy, Joint Staff, DoD modernization priorities, and Combatant Command (CCMD) needs.  Completed ECTD projects transition to joint programs through fielded operationally relevant prototypes; technology adoption into programs of record; integration into system level, multi-year joint demonstrations; and through advanced research and engineering efforts like the Warfighting Lab Incentive Fund for further development of tactics, techniques, procedures, and concepts of operations.  Previously selected ECTD projects have been accelerated to complete in FY 2020 or will transition to Program Element 0603338D8Z in FY 2021.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In alignment with the National Defense Strategy, the Emerging Capabilities Technology Development (ECTD) Program Element (PE) supports the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) with experimentation and mid-term, mission-focused capability development that crosses functional domains and enhances warfighter lethality, technical superiority, adaptability, and resilience.  ECTD funding supports joint prototype development, joint experimentation for concept of operations (CONOPs) development, and red teaming validations that enable disruptive innovation to sustain the United States' operational superiority.  Joint demonstrations and ECTD-sponsored venues of defense-wide experiments provide opportunities for emerging technologies to succeed, or fail fast.  Demonstration venues include: Stiletto, a maritime experimentation and demonstration platform; Thunderstorm, a multi-domain venue focused on small and non-traditional businesses; Silent Hammer, an advanced electronic warfare venue; and, other tailored experimentation and demonstration events.  The red teaming funding line explores vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and enables USD(R&amp;E), and the broader defense science and technology community, to make informed decisions before investing in new capabilities.  Red teaming enables adaptation to unforeseen vulnerabilities or opportunities early in capability development when design changes are cost effective and programs can be re-directed if developmental dead ends are discovered.  ECTD prototypes, demonstrations, experimentations, and red teaming validations enable developers to showcase new and maturing capabilities in realistic environments and against realistic threats with operational user involvement.

ECTD prototyping projects increase the speed of technology innovation by reducing technology risk for emerging capabilities.  With an emphasis on joint and interagency partnerships, ECTD matures capability options to anticipate and inform new acquisition pathways in addition to formal requirements and acquisition processes.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Red Teaming project supports assessments and demonstrations to stress and assess emerging systems with the intent of gaining or maintaining overmatch earlier in the life cycle.  The project helps assess the susceptibility and vulnerability of emerging technologies and newly developed systems, and helps identify unanticipated disruptive opportunities and technological dead ends.  The project improves systems by reducing vulnerabilities and providing a holistic understanding of employment risks in operationally-representative environments and against potential threats prior to full funding commitments.  The Red Teaming project supports three broad types of red teaming: 1) Early stage horizon scanning and assessments of weaknesses and opportunities of pre-development technologies from an adversary perspective; 2) Targeted, low-fidelity prototypes to assess utility and inform design choices prior to funding commitments; and 3) Red teams, war games, and field experiments with maturing technology to understand how to implement new technologies and adapt to adversary responses.  This effort leverages the innovative capabilities of other defense red teaming organizations within the Department, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academia.  Deliverables will inform requirements, new concepts of operations (CONOPS), and help accelerate technology acquisition pathways for joint missions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Red Teaming to Support DoD Modernization Priorities funds efforts to explore new capabilities in a competitive environment.  Efforts include: 1) Early investigations and red teaming to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities and opportunities from emerging and conceptual technologies.  Projects will help define and anticipate impacts from new technologies, including current DoD investments and external technologies, to understand operational utility and identify threats from tangentially related sectors that can have significant negative impacts on current DoD investments.  2) Maturation of Service and Defense Agency identified prototypes to enable red teaming, demonstrations, experiments, and CONOPS earlier in the development cycle.  These prototypes increase agility and rate of innovation for emerging capabilities, while reducing cost and risk.  3) Exploring unconventional approaches to counter current DoD and adversary technologies through red teams, war games, simulation exercises, and studies that employ government laboratory scientists; subject matter experts; and, students of science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines.  Red teaming events range from distributed table-top games to simulated and live field exercises with non-traditional and operationally experienced participants.  Deliverables include characterizations of future prototypes, requirement definitions, recommendations on system operational employment, potential vulnerabilities, and likely countermeasures that could be taken by the threat as well as potential counter-countermeasures to increase functionality or operational effectiveness of the system.  The USD(R&amp;E) will leverage these products to inform how technologies and integrated systems can perform in hostile environments and develop new CONOPS.

In FY 2019, red teaming efforts were conducted to support the National Defense Strategy’s priority for increased lethality and the Department of Defense’s modernization priorities for cyber and artificial intelligence/machine learning.  An early stage investigation was conducted to explore inherent vulnerabilities in a conceptual, pre-development technology prior to full funding commitments.  A prototype was developed and assessed for utility by an associated red teaming event with operationally-experienced participants.  Maturing technologies were red teamed to, either understand how best to implement and adapt the technology into CONOPS, or determine how best to counter adversary responses to the technology.  Additional details are classified.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>SERDP`s mission is to improve DoD mission readiness and environmental performance by providing new scientific knowledge and developing cost-effective technologies. SERDP does this by addressing high-priority DoD environmental technology requirements such as addressing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) contamination, developing fluorine-free fire suppression formulations, and improving corrosion resistance for weapons systems and platforms. Technologies developed by SERDP enhance military operations, improve military systems' effectiveness, enhance military training/readiness, sustain DoD ‘straining and test ranges and installation infrastructure, and help ensure the safety and welfare of military personnel and their dependents. The keys to growing list of SERDP technological successes are the ability to respond aggressively and proactively to priority defense environmental needs; the pursuit of world-class technical excellence; and an emphasis on continuous technology transfer.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) supports the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition (ASD(A))'s responsibilities for acquisition and portfolio management.  JWP underwrites analyses, studies, limited scope experiments, wargaming, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develops credible requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on potential remedies to align acquisition investments and solutions for joint capability gaps created by future warfighting environments and emerging threats.  JWP supports two main lines of effort, mission integration management and cyber resiliency wargames. Mission integration management will access specific critical mission threads, determine defense investments to fix lethality deficiencies, and to develop kill chain data modeling.  Cyber resiliency wargames will be conducted in support of Combatant Commands mission areas to develop strategies for mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities focusing on ballistic missile defense, nuclear command and control and other key mission areas relevant to national security challenges.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Warfighting Program (JWP) supports the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition (ASD(A))'s responsibilities for acquisition and portfolio management.  JWP underwrites analyses, studies, limited scope experiments, wargaming, and partnerships that define joint capability gaps and develops credible requirements for follow-on acquisition efforts.  These analyses and assessments deliver independent perspectives on potential remedies to align acquisition investments and solutions for joint capability gaps created by future warfighting environments and emerging threats.  JWP supports two main lines of effort, mission integration management and cyber resiliency wargames. Mission integration management will access specific critical mission threads, determine defense investments to fix lethality deficiencies, and to develop kill chain data modeling.  Cyber resiliency wargames will be conducted in support of Combatant Commands mission areas to develop strategies for mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities focusing on ballistic missile defense, nuclear command and control and other key mission areas relevant to national security challenges.

Anticipated Impact:
Provides analytical support for acquisition efforts for ASD(A) staff elements and joint customers.  It promotes analyses and assessments for acquisition insights and decisions focused on capability development serving the needs of joint forces and the warfighter.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Defense-Wide Reviews (DWR) - Funding for the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative was reduced by $9.7 million in FY 2021 resulting from the DWR, which focused on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage. The FY2021 reduction is offset by an administrative zero-sum transfer ($3.0 million) from PE 0804767D8Z (i.e., Combatant Commander Exercise Engagement and Training Transformation [CE2T2] from The Joint Staff [TJS]).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) describes the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative. This PE provides policy oversight and guidance for distributed learning (e.g., online courses, smartphone-based learning, web browser–based simulations) and supports associated modernization and coordination across DoD, coalition partners (e.g., NATO), and other federal agencies. This PE helps DoD and its partners maintain modern and interoperable digital learning systems for delivering training and education anytime and anywhere at scale. This program was originally established in 1997 in response to the NDAA (FY99, Section 378 of Public Law 105-261) and granted additional authorities via Executive Orders (e.g., EO 13111) and other supporting publications (e.g., 10 U.S. Code §2249d). 

This PE’s work falls into three interrelated categories: (1) Modernization, (2) Documentation, and (3) Coordination. The modernization work involves Advanced Technology Development in technical areas such as digital learning systems interoperability, learning analytics, and learning science for delivery at scale. These efforts inform the PE’s documentation work, including the authoring and upkeep of technical guidance and policy documents such as DoD Instruction 1322.26 (“Distributed Learning”) and software interoperability specifications. Finally, coordination efforts consist of implementation support and interagency/interorganizational coordination. 

This PE’s modernization investments are driven by requirements collected from the Defense ADL Advisory Committee, a working group that represents agencies’ distributed learning equities (refer to DoDI 1322.26). These requirements are also aligned to DoD/federal strategic direction, such as the DoD Chief Management Officer’s Digital Learning Modernization reform, Army Learning Strategy, Navy’s Sailor 2025, and Air Force Strategic Master Plan. 

This PE benefits DoD in three ways. (1) Interoperability: It strengthens interagency, interorganizational, and multinational interoperability by governing distributed learning interoperability policy, maintaining current technical reference guidelines, and fostering their implementation across communities of practice. (2) Efficiencies: It saves government resources by fostering unity of effort across DoD, other federal agencies, and coalition partners for distributed learning, eliminating duplications and identifying opportunities for interagency collaboration. (3) Learning Effectiveness: It helps improve training and education effectiveness by helping DoD, federal, and coalition stakeholders acquire and implement digital learning capabilities effectively and cost-efficiently. In sum, this work supports DoD Components’ training and education missions, helping them increase personnel readiness while driving down training and education portfolio costs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:AppChangeSummary>Decrease in FY2021 (-$9.7 million) reflects Defense-Wide Review reform initiatives. Reduction will consolidate leased facilities and reduce contractor support for the following areas: learning analytics, microlearning mobile-learning platform, enterprise learner record repository, and DoD learning-at-scale strategy. The reframed program will sustain technical assessment of, and limited R&amp;D for, learning data standards and interoperability (across DoD, Federal Government, and industry), Digital Learning Modernization reforms, DoD distributed learning requirements collection, and the learning services ecosystem. It will also retain the program’s Department-wide distributed learning technology and policy advisory role focused on ensuring technology/data standards alignment across DoD.

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Advanced Technology Development Program Element (PE) applies the software and computer science concepts developed under the 0602751D8Z PE to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Software is more pervasive than ever, and computer programs are growing in size and complexity.  Designing, managing, and securing integrated, complex, and large- scale mission-critical systems are abilities that the DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) have not yet mastered.  Reliance on software-intensive mobile and net- based products and systems has increased (e.g., Joint Tactical Radio System, USS ZUMWALT (DDG-1000), Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and Army Modernization).  As stated in the February 2018 Defense Science Board Report, “Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems,” software is a crucial and growing part of weapons systems and the national security mission, and the DoD must address its ability to build and sustain software continuously and indefinitely.  With growing global parity in software engineering, the DoD must maintain leadership to ensure a competitive advantage.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) was established in 1984 as an integral part of the DoD’s initiative to identify, evaluate, and transition software engineering technologies and practices.  The mission of the SEI is to provide the DoD with technical leadership and innovation through research and development to advance the practice of software engineering and technology.  The SEI works across government, industry, and academia to improve the state of software engineering from the technical, acquisition, and management perspectives.  The SEI engages in research and development of critical software technologies and tools and collaborates with the larger software engineering research community.  It facilitates rapid transition of software engineering technologies into practice and evaluates emerging software engineering technologies to determine their potential for improving software-intensive DoD systems.  Since its inception, the SEI has helped to transform the fields of software engineering and acquisition, network security, real-time systems, software architectures, and software-engineering process management.

The SEI Program Element (PE) addresses the critical need to research, develop, and rapidly transition state-of-the-art software technology, tools, development environments, and best practices to improve the engineering, management, fielding, evolution, acquisition, and sustainment of software-intensive DoD systems.  The research conducted by this PE directly benefits the technical domains such as Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I), Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber, and Engineered Resilient Systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

SEI research focuses on the most significant and pervasive software challenges within the DoD, such as the scalability and reliability of software assurance, supply chain risk management, validation of and trust in autonomous systems, human-computer and human-technology teaming and interaction, computing and communication at the tactical edge, and efficiency and performance of acquisition strategies and software development appropriate for a contested cyber environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This research seeks to mature and rapidly prototype techniques to verify methods for identifying requirements, systems of systems architectures, and virtual integration of components.  Furthermore, research in this area will pursue rapid prototyping and transitioning of capabilities that verify requirements for software assurance, analysis/control of unverified code and automated repair of damaged code.  Software production and code analysis methods developed through this program will also improve the ability to predict how complex software systems, including AI-enabled systems, will behave in untested environments.  Increasingly, large numbers of lines of code and the addition of machine-learning techniques will require a commensurate increase in sophisticated verification and validation mechanisms.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2021, all funding and project investment areas in the Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element (PE) will transition to PE 0603338D8Z Defense Modernization and Prototyping.  The new PE will continue to leverage the year of execution processes that allow QRSP to rapidly develop relatively low cost, risk reducing prototypes for potentially high payoff opportunities.  Through consolidation, the PE increases the Department’s ability to coordinate activities across the Services and Defense Agencies, removes duplication of effort, enables rapid pivots to new threats, and provides the resources necessary to ensure technological overmatch against future threats.  This realignment directly supports the Department’s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy.

Funding in the QRSP PE enables leadership within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) to leverage rapidly maturing technologies from small and non-traditional businesses within the year of execution and incubate them to potentially game-changing capabilities.  Through streamlined processes, QRSP captures emergent opportunities and addresses time sensitive mission threats through low cost, higher-risk prototypes.

In FY 2020, the Quick Reaction Fund (QRF) within the QRSP PE was transferred to PE 0603699D8Z Emerging Capabilities Technology Development to support the priorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)).  Additionally, in FY 2020 the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell Support (JRAC) was transferred to PE 0903399D8Z within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment for alignment and execution.  To support the transition of JRAC to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, previously appropriated funding for JRAC is displayed within the Rapid Reaction Fund.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Quick Reaction Special Projects (QRSP) Program Element (PE) funds the development of risk-reducing prototypes and accelerates capability innovation to deliver performance to the joint warfighter at the speed of relevance.  QRSP prototypes increase warfighter lethality, affordably counter emerging technological threats, and help address the immediate needs of the Combatant Commands (CCMD).  Due to the relatively low average cost of projects, QRSP is able to explore higher-risk opportunities with potentially higher reward.  Project selection is guided by Department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, the Department of Defense’s (DoD) modernization priorities, and the CCMD’s Integrated Priority Lists (IPLs).

The QRSP Program supports four major project codes that expedite development and transition of new capabilities to the warfighter.  These project codes are:  1) Quick Reaction Fund (QRF), 2) Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF), 3) Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) support, and 4) Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA).  Efforts within these project codes align to DoD science and technology priorities, address challenges identified in the National Defense Strategy, and support the DoD’s modernization priorities. Funding and activities within QRF transferred to other Program Elements in FY 2020.

RRF develops prototypes to counter emerging threats; anticipates adversaries’ exploitation of new technologies; and, expedites delivery of effective, affordable, and critically needed capabilities to the warfighter.  RRF initiatives accelerate innovation by rapidly developing high-risk prototypes with the potential for immediate and impactful transition of warfighter capabilities.  RRF leverages emerging capabilities, such as machine learning algorithms and software intelligence, to enable novel prototypes with agile technology insertion paths.  Funded projects also leverage existing capabilities from the traditional industrial base and non-traditional suppliers in the commercial sector, academia, international arenas, and small businesses.      

SMA supports senior leadership within the CCMDs, Joint Force Commanders, and other government agencies by assessing complex operational and technical challenges, which require collaborative multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches.  With input from across the U.S. government, academia, and the private sector, the SMA develops options to Joint Staff and CCMD-generated challenging problems to inform senior leadership.  Each assessment is initiated at the request of CCMD senior leadership.  The Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO) sets priorities for SMA programs.  SMA products are typically generated within six to nine months and directly contribute to the decision-making process of the Joint Staff and CCMD senior leadership.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Wildwood provided solutions to the widespread cyber challenges faced by DoD and the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) that are the legacy of Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and other systems initially designed for small trusted enclaves.  Wildwood developed, tested, and deployed a network of spatially diverse nodes on the open internet for experimentation, measurement, testing, and modeling of a proposed network technology, architecture, and hardware that breaks with the historic internet paradigm.  Wildwood enables replacement of the current security model by moving from a reactionary profile to a well-designed, defensible, high-speed network architecture that can provide privacy in both fact of transmission and content in traffic.  A fully deployed system will radically reduce the cyber vulnerability footprint, without requiring redesign of the legacy, currently vulnerable system, and will reduce the cost of security imposed on DoD, DIB, and civilian systems.  Wildwood transitioned to Missile Defense Agency and a classified DoD partner for further development and implementation of a fully deployed system.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY 2021, the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) will transition to PE 0603338D8Z Defense Modernization and Prototyping.  This realignment directly supports the Department’s modernization plans by streamlining investments, reducing the time from discovery to deployment, and enabling development of disruptive technologies to help realize the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF) produces innovative prototypes with a high potential for disruptive improvement and transitions them to joint warfighters and Combatant Commands (CCMDs).  RRF’s streamlined business processes address mission gaps through partnerships with small and non-traditional companies, Service labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, allied nations, and transition partners within the warfighter user community.  RRF anticipates adversaries' exploitation of technology, including current and emerging commercial capabilities, and rapidly responds to new threats and opportunities.  Project selection is guided by department-level strategies and priorities, such as the National Defense Strategy and the DoD’s modernization areas.  Needs are identified and prototype projects are funded within the year of execution to demonstrate the feasibility of new technologies, enable integration into larger systems, and deliver affordable capabilities faster than standard acquisition cycles.  RRF prototypes inform future acquisition or transition through rapid technology refresh and insertion into joint mission capabilities.  These lower-cost prototypes and innovative business processes give the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) the agility to quickly explore new, higher-risk technology areas that have the potential for immediate, game-changing impacts.

In prior years, RRF supported the creation of novel sensing systems; provided low-cost capabilities for small-footprint operations; expanded human, social, and cultural knowledge relevant to military decision making; increased small unit situational awareness; produced advanced biometrics and forensics capabilities; performed strategic multi-layer assessments; and, established a prototyping through non-traditional pathways outreach effort that facilitates better interactions with small, non-traditional companies developing innovative technologies.  In FY 2020, RRF continues to support the USD(R&amp;E) and provides a hedge against technology risk by identifying and delivering near-term capabilities to support irregular warfare operations.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In FY 2021, the Strategic Multi-Layered Assessment (SMA) Support will transition to PE 0603338D8Z Defense Modernization and Prototyping.  The transition of SMA will enable continued support to senior Combatant Command (CCMD) leadership and Joint Force Commanders while ensuring that funding resources are properly allocated to meet rapidly evolving and emergent threats.    

The mission of SMA is to provide traditional and non-traditional planning and decision support to CCMDs and other U.S. Government departments and agencies on a case-by-case basis.  SMA products are designed to expand the Commanders' operational and strategic horizons and choices when facing complex environments by introducing the power of cognitive diversity from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and researchers employing varied paradigms and methodologies.  SMA frames options, but does not make specific policy or strategy recommendations.  SMA receives formal requests for support from the CCMDs at the senior Flag Officer level.  These requests are reviewed by Joint Staff J-39 Deputy Director for Global Operations (DDGO) and USD(R&amp;E) for validation based on the following criteria: (1) The problem requires multi-agency, multi-disciplinary approaches; and (2) Expertise required for the assessment does not lie within the core competencies of a single command or agency but instead, requires the collective inputs from across the U.S. Government, academia, policy centers, and the private sector. SMA is also supported by the Rapid Reaction Fund (RRF).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Challenges addressed with SMA efforts require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approaches that are not within the customer organization’s core competency.  SMA started a strategic analysis effort at the request of the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  The effort evaluated strategic risks and identified knowledge gaps to provide an increased understanding of potential security environments and their implications for Palestinian security sector reform.  U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) subsequently asked SMA to apply the same methodology to identify emerging Russian threats and opportunities in Eurasia.  SMA efforts are facilitated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff/J-3 Operations and are executed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>SMA will actively work with the CCMDs and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to identify challenging problems within the scope described above.  These problems will be in direct support of CCMD senior leadership and may include areas such as: counter terrorism; transnational criminal organizations; counter weapons of mass destruction (state and non-state); counter global or regional social and cultural assessments; regional stability assessments; and, individual state or national level deterrence studies.  Specifically for FY 2020, SMA will conduct an assessment entitled "Competition &amp; Conflict Dynamics Incubator in the Eurasian Landmass."  SMA proposes to establish a testbed (or incubator) to study changing regional dynamics amidst increasing great power competition.  These include anticipated trajectories of state and non-state factors inherent to the region of concern as well as potential black swan scenarios that could greatly alter the balances of both hard and soft power in the Central Region in ways detrimental to key U.S. interests.

To accomplish this effort, SMA will leverage a highly effective and expansive virtual network of globally placed SMEs using relationships with numerous agencies and organizations, including Military Departments/Services, DoD analysis centers, other U.S. Government departments and agencies, the private sector, academia, and partner nation governments.  Structured interviews, literature reviews, original research, modeling and simulation, and gaming are all ways that SMA gathers input for their products.  The input is then curated and goes through several rounds of coordination that includes a Senior Review Group (SRG) before completion.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The reductions to Engineering Science and Technology reflect a decrement from the Defense Wide Review, a realignment of resources into the Systems Engineering (SE) Program Element (0605142D8Z) to support enhanced engineering expertise and assessments for mission-oriented prototypes focused on modernization priorities, and a reduction for other DoD priorities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) advances engineering state of the practice, and complex defense systems challenges through development of engineering capabilities to improve acquisition quality.  Engineering science and technology, including systems engineering (SE) research, supports the cost-effective acquisition of complex systems.

This PE increases lethality and supports Department business reform (National Defense Strategy Lines of Effort 1 and 3 respectively).  Improvements to the Department's systems engineering capabilities ensure we quickly and affordably field a lethal Joint Force by addressing dependencies in system and mission capabilities, rapidly evolving technologies, lifecycle considerations, and resource limitations in the face of dynamic threats and missions.  

In FY 2021, DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO) funding Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) activities will transition to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z).

The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) is a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2008 as a strategic resource to conduct systems research and improve the Department’s ability to develop and deploy complex weapon systems.  The SERC consists of a network of 22 research universities from across the U.S. working collaboratively to bring the best academic talent in the nation to bear on DoD’s systems engineering research problems.  During FY 2021, SERC funding will be reduced to realign activities to the Department’s modernization priorities.  The SERC will complete R&amp;E funded projects started in prior fiscal years and R&amp;E will establish a business model to sustain the SERC’s network of universities for utilization by other DoD components.  In addition, following the realignment of FY 2021 resources, approximately $2.000 million of Systems Engineering (0605142D8Z) resources will be used to sustain SERC operations for continued support of Service funded projects. 

The Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) project reduces the risk in development of future weapon systems and ensures warfighter success through better-informed acquisition decisions.  ERS integrates high-fidelity, physics-based modeling with advanced analytic tools to enable rapid design and analysis of current and future weapon systems.  Through the use of high-performance computing, optimized computational tools, and improved processes and methods, ERS enables faster evaluation of system performance, systems-of-systems analysis, and system evaluation within operationally relevant environments to complement and reduce costly physical testing.  In order to focus ERS efforts on the Department’s modernization priorities, ERS project funding will transition in FY 2021 to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z).  With further ERS advances from a development project to an enduring support capability, this shift will better align with the purpose of research funded by projects associated with Systems Engineering.  This change directly orients the previously developed capabilities to address modernization efforts driven by the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) funding and mission realigns to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z) in FY 2021 to support enhanced engineering expertise and assessments for mission-oriented prototypes that address modernization priorities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ERS integrates high-fidelity, physics-based modeling with advanced analytic tools to enable rapid design and analysis of current and future weapon systems.  Through the use of high-performance computing, optimized computational tools, and improved processes and methods, ERS enables faster evaluation of system performance, systems-of-systems analysis, and system evaluation within operationally relevant environments to complement and reduce costly physical testing.  ERS project funding will transition in FY 2021 to Systems Engineering (Program Element 0605142D8Z), with further ERS research funded by projects associated with the modernization priorities.  This change directly orients the previously developed capabilities to address modernization efforts driven by the National Defense Strategy.

ERS products are engineering design visualization and tool integration frameworks that integrate physics-based models and engineering tools to greatly improve the ability to perform tradespace and requirements analysis, optimize designs, and evaluate system performance.

ERS leverages multi-fidelity physics-based models developed by the S&amp;T community to inform the acquisition decision process, e.g., increased/easier use of high-performance computing, analyses of massive data sets, and lifecycle cost sensitivity analysis.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Set-Based Design: Improve and test primary framework for ERS next-generation tradespace analysis tools with data storage, statistical analysis, and advanced visualization techniques; develop model integration technologies to retain tradespaces and other early conceptual design artifacts; and develop linkage between system requirements and tradespace analysis, (e.g., multi-domain analysis of Air Force fixed-wing and missile design alternatives).

Computational Engineering: Develop design process automation to rapidly incorporate new and existing high-fidelity models into the analysis of existing and proposed weapon systems; develop and demonstrate advanced parametric design and optimization tools to create credible acquisition models; develop computational environments that facilitate the use of high-performance computing infrastructure within the engineering design and analysis processes, (e.g., increasing the number of propeller designs evaluated for subsurface propulsion).

Large-Scale Data Analytics: Leverage physical test datasets and national investments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies in order to produce concept prognostic and diagnostic tools for lifecycle analyses; begin exploration of the deployment of algorithms and tools trained with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to DoD platforms, (e.g., large scale data analysis of rotorcraft prognostics and health management data to inform sustainment decisions).</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>During FY 2020, ERS research will focus on reducing the decision risk associated with hypersonic and directed energy weapon systems.  ERS will also continue efforts to enable the use of artificial intelligence for design and analysis of future weapon platforms.  Further, ERS will work to transition from Engineering S&amp;T funded activities to requirements directly funded by DoD’s modernization priorities.  

Specifically, ERS will advance research in the following areas: 

• Automated Engineering Processes: develop and deliver a decision-support environment that enables set-based design, optimization, tradespace analysis, and visualization of data from DoD platforms; and incorporate techniques to increase reuse of data, models, software tools, and analyses, e.g., developing methods and tools for multi-domain analysis of hypersonics vehicles.

• Integrated High-Fidelity Simulations: develop and evolve computational tools to support parametric design environments; use high-performance computing to speed analyses; and integrate multiple disciplines into ERS workflows such as high-fidelity fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and/or other performance determination models.

• High-Performance Data Analytics: evolve data engineering techniques to improve storage, labeling, and analysis of vast operational datasets from existing weapon systems; demonstrate machine learning methods to gain insight from weapon system data; and explore the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assist humans in the design of new weapon systems.</r2:Text>

- High Energy Laser lethality: Collect additional data on laser damage effects experimentation from the services, including modeling and simulation results.  Once this data is collected, it will be organized into to a unified database which can be accessed by the operational HEL laser community for integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) mission planning, including transferring the results into a Directed Energy Joint Munition Effectiveness Manual for those missions.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Starting in FY 2020, Project 097 title will change FROM "Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Test" TO "Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence Test" to more accurately define and describe project workload in terms of the National Defense Strategy and the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) prioritization of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&amp;E/S&amp;T) Program seeks out and develops test technologies to keep pace with evolving weapons technologies.  Aligned with the National Defense Strategy, this program is critical to ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) has the ability to adequately test the advanced systems that will be fielded in the future, building a more lethal force.  To meet this objective, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program performs the following activities:
• Exploits new technologies and processes to meet important test and evaluation (T&amp;E) requirements.
• Expedites the transition of new technologies from the laboratory environment to the T&amp;E community.
• Leverages industry advances in equipment, modeling and simulation, and networking to support T&amp;E.
Additionally, the T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program examines emerging T&amp;E requirements resulting from Joint Service initiatives to identify T&amp;E technology needs and develop a long-range roadmap for technology insertion.  The program leverages and employs applicable applied research efforts from the highly developed technology base in DoD laboratories and test centers, other Government agencies, and industry to accelerate development of new test capabilities.  The program outreaches and engages academia to address test technology challenges in DoD testing, advancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and other minority serving institutions.  This program provides travel funds for T&amp;E/S&amp;T program oversight, special studies, analyses, and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program aligns with the science and technology (S&amp;T) Communities of Interest (COI) to prepare the T&amp;E community to test warfighting capabilities that emerge from priority S&amp;T investments.  The T&amp;E/S&amp;T Program is funded within the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it develops and demonstrates high payoff technologies for current and future DoD test capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>High-speed/hypersonic weapons are being developed to ensure the continued military superiority and strike capability of the United States including freedom of movement and freedom of action in areas protected by anti-access/area denial defenses.  Current weapon system demonstrations and technology development programs include high-speed and hypersonic air-breathing missiles, maneuvering reentry and boost-glide weapons, hypersonic gun-launched projectiles, and air-breathing space access vehicles.  These systems require development of conventional and high-speed turbine, ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle engines; high temperature materials; thermal protection systems (TPS); and thermal management systems.  The High Speed Systems Test (HSST) project addresses test technology needs including propulsion, aerodynamic and aerothermal testing, so the test community has the technology to support the required test scenarios for concepts under development in the S&amp;T community.  The technology developments within the HSST project align with the Department of Defense (DoD) S&amp;T priority investments.  As such, the HSST project is developing, validating and transitioning advanced T&amp;E technologies for ground test, open-air range flight test, and advanced computational tools, along with instrumentation and diagnostics systems for use in both ground tests and flight tests of high speed systems.
The HSST project develops technologies to enable robust, accurate, and timely T&amp;E of these future weapon systems.  DoD acquisition regulations require weapon systems to undergo a thorough T&amp;E process to detect deficiencies early and to ensure system suitability and survivability.  However, the extreme environments in which these weapons operate preclude accurate determination of their performance and operability with today’s T&amp;E assets.  Current national test capabilities have deficiencies in data accuracy, flight condition replication and simulation, test methods, productivity, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) fidelity, and range safety.
The HSST mission is to address these national test capability gaps by providing test technology solutions that will enable high-speed and hypersonic weapon systems to be successfully developed through accurate, robust, and efficient T&amp;E.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The HSST project continued to advance ground and flight test technologies, techniques, instrumentation, and modeling and simulation capabilities required for the development of high speed air-breathing propulsion and boost-glide weapons.  The HSST project continued progress toward addressing the two most significant technology shortfalls in current hypersonic aero propulsion ground test capabilities: clean air heat addition (i.e. non-vitiated air) and variable Mach number test capability.  Current production ground test facilities create the high temperature propulsion system inlet conditions necessary for air-breathing scramjet engine testing by burning fuel in the facility airflow supplied to the engine inlet for operation.  As demonstrated by a previous HSST test, the resulting vitiated air has different gas properties than clean air found in the atmosphere and thus is not representative of what the vehicle would experience during flight.  This significantly affects the engine’s performance and operability in the test environment resulting in erroneous flight performance predictions.  In addition to the ability to test in clean air, a variable Mach number capability is required to “fly the mission” and determine the critical transient operability effects throughout the flight envelope.  Incorporation of component technologies, previously developed by the T&amp;E/S&amp;T program, were integrated into a small-scale, clean air, true temperature, and variable Mach number aero propulsion test facility, called the Hypersonic Aerothermal and Propulsion Clean Air Testbed (HAPCAT).  Completion of this facility will demonstrate that the component technologies and their integration have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, provide an on-going test asset to the DoD, and reduce risk for construction of a full-scale facility.  The Regenerative Storage Heater (RSH), was demonstrated at flight representative temperatures, allowing non-vitiated air up to Mach 7.5 conditions to be supplied.  Final design, fabrication, and installation of the air delivery system (ADS) was completed, which will permit uniform flow into the test cabin with variable pressure and temperature from multiple sources, including the RSH.  The facility initiated checkout runs to validate its operation to support DoD weapon systems.
The design for a free-jet, variable Mach nozzle (VMN) for use in HAPCAT was continued.  Such a capability will permit much more accurate simulation of transient operations along a flight trajectory in a free-jet configuration.  The design of the VMN will also serve as a risk-reduction effort for a larger-scale VMN for use in the future full-scale facility.
  Efforts continued on the installation of a variable Mach number direct-connect nozzle for hypersonic ground test facilities that will provide flight-equivalent Mach numbers between 4 and 6 at true temperatures.  The nozzle utilizes a metallic flexible wall to vary the Mach number while withstanding the high temperatures.  It will be integrated into the HAPCAT facility upon completion for checkout.
  The development of a high-pressure tunable-diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) continued for eventual integration into HAPCAT to provide accurate air temperature measurements at high temperatures and pressures, which will be used for facility control and determination of facility conditions. The TDLAS system will have uses in other facilities as well for temperature measurements.
  The arc heater flow quality aerothermal test technology development progressed toward independently-powered spin-coils to control the physical characteristics of the spinning arc column, its attachment location and duration on electrode surfaces within the arc heater.  The effort investigated two different spin-coil designs, one of which was validated for use in the mid-pressure arc heater facility.  This effort will improve the service life of the electrodes and improve nozzle flow quality.  
  The HSST project continued research that will provide better prediction and determination of boundary layer growth and transition effects upon hypersonic vehicle performance.  Understanding and predicting boundary layer transition represents a critical shortfall in the hypersonic community, as it affects the thermal loads, stability and control, and overall performance of a vehicle.  Test data from a seven degree cone model were evaluated to assess test techniques and boundary layer transition measurement capabilities between various facilities.  Analysis of tests of a boost-glide vehicle were completed in a quiet wind tunnel environment and a traditional, “noisy” wind tunnel environment, providing insight into the effects of flow field disturbances on boundary layer transition continued.
  Facility flow field characterizations were conducted at the Purdue quiet tunnel and the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) facilities at Calspan University at Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC), enabling more effective comparisons between all the facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility.  The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in these facilities.  The HSST project also conducted testing of a boost-glide vehicle, resulting in critical findings to support future flight tests of the vehicle.   
  
  The HSST project continued the design and development of a SkyRange capability to support hypersonic flight testing.  This capability aims to provide a more agile, flexible, and cost-effective method for providing support to hypersonic flight tests in the areas of telemetry, atmospheric sensing, optical imaging, flight safety, and other fields to aid in the development of hypersonic vehicles.  The capability will reduce the requirement and high-costs of the “string of pearls” collection of air, sea, and land resources used for hypersonic flight tests.  Several different technologies within the HSST project will be integrated as part of the SkyRange.  
  Development of an airborne version of the already completed ground LIDAR system continued with the design and testing of hardware components for the in-flight demonstration of the system in preparation for implementation on an un-crewed vehicle.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.
  Progress continued on a high fidelity automated airborne reconfigurable tracking system which seeks to provide high resolution imaging of hypersonic vehicles in flight.  The final design was completed including concepts for integration onto a Global Hawk aircraft.  Design for integration of the system on-board an unmanned Global Hawk also continued.  This technology will be integrated as part of a SkyRange capability as well.
  The development and improvement of a telemetry capability integrated with a High Altitude, Long Endurance Un-crewed Aerial System (HALE UAS) for a technical demonstration continued.  An iterative development process is ongoing and the latest version of the system was integrated onto a Global Hawk and ground tested. In preparation for long range flight tests, multiple Range Hawks were deployed to Hawaii to exercise CONOPS for multi-aircraft mission support.</r2:Description>

These developments includes airborne demonstration of the LIDAR system and the optical imaging system on-board manned aircraft and additional airborne testing of the telemetry system on a Global Hawk UAV. 
The HAPCAT facility will begin initial checkout operations to verify the ability to mix various air supply sources and provide a uniform, steady flow to the test cabin using clean air to support aerothermal, aero-optic, and propulsion testing of hypersonic systems. The use of a variable-Mach number direct connect nozzle will also be demonstrated in the facility.
Progress will be made in the design of the variable-Mach number free-jet nozzle for eventual integration into the HAPCAT facility.  The development will feed directly into a larger-scale variant for use in the full-scale facility to be built in the future.
Additional tests and analysis will be conducted in an effort to construct a methodology for predicting boundary layer transition on hypersonic vehicles through ground testing and computations.  This development includes a HIFiRE-5b flight-matching experiment to assess ground-to-flight comparison capabilities and a scale-effects test entry using a boost-glide geometry.  Such work will supplement the previous work performed in this area under the HSST project.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>The HSST project will continue developments to improve hypersonic ground and flight test capabilities to levels required for acquisition programs. Development and characterization of the variable-Mach number free-jet nozzle and integration into the HAPCAT facility will continue.  Progress will be made in the development of test techniques to determine the combined aerodynamic and aerothermal effects on sensor and seeker performance.  Improvements to Thermal Protection System (TPS) test capabilities will be made by developing new test technologies that enable the testing of larger test articles (3x) with more complex geometries for longer test durations. Enhancements to TPS test facilities will also be initiated enabling the simulation of flight trajectories on the ground to better characterize TPS performance in support of hypersonic vehicle design optimization for range, survivability and payload. Development will be initiated to increase the capacity of TPS test facilities to support the increasing demand of hypersonic TPS test needs. Current arc heater test facility availability is a critical-path, schedule bottleneck for hypersonic programs; Improved TPS test capabilities will increase throughput of hypersonic test programs developing TPS. Flight test infrastructure improvements will continue to enable better data collection including high resolution optics, atmospheric measurements, and terminal scoring capability. Investments to improve flight test infrastructure will be initiated to increase the op tempo of tests and improve data quality in support of hypersonic flight tests. More agile flight tests assets will be developed reducing schedule inflexibility, improving data collection, improving terminal scoring capability, and adding additional instrumentation platforms. Data limitations associated with inflexible test instrumentation assets increases uncertainty &amp; risk in system performance, requiring more test flights to mitigate.
Conduct facility flow field characterizations at the Large Energy National Shock (LENS) facilities at Calspan University at Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC), enabling more effective comparisons between similar test facilities and informing test customers of intrinsic flow features in each facility.  The characterizations will also provide insight to boundary layer transition studies in the facility. Conduct technology development for a new test capability at LENS to perform long duration aero-optic and ablation testing of interceptors at flight velocities and conditions. The new test capability will enable the ground testing of missile defense, hypersonic, and reentry systems at flight matched conditions for mission relevant test durations.</r2:Text>

New TPS test facility development to include the support of multiple classified programs concurrently will continue along with additional test control cells for independent operations between different arc heaters. New test article preparation areas will reduce test set-up time and increases throughput. Improvements to flight test infrastructure increasing op tempo and data quality will continue to include the continued development of in-flight imaging systems. Continued development of airborne instrumentation capable of reducing atmospheric conditions data uncertainty, critical to assess system design (lift vs. drag), will continue. The development of more agile flight test assets will also continue. Development of airborne assets as flight test instrumentation platforms reduces schedule inflexibility compared to the limited operational tempo of ships &amp; barges. Better data collection to include high resolution optics, improved atmospheric measurements, and terminal area scoring in the Broad Ocean Area (BOA) for end game targeting will continue. 
Efforts will continue to investigate new flight test techniques, develop new ground test instrumentation, improve and validate CFD codes, and transition HSST technologies to the hypersonic community.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Weapon systems have become increasingly complex in recent years, resulting in the need for significantly more data to be passed among these systems as well as between the systems and our test infrastructure.  A vast amount of data must be collected, transmitted, and analyzed, which requires a large amount of radio frequency (RF) spectrum resources.  However, the amount of RF spectrum designated to support test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is decreasing, most notably due to reallocation of spectrum for commercial use.  The combination of decreasing RF spectrum and increasing data requirements results in an urgent need to develop test technologies that maximize the use of spectrum resources for Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E operations.
  The L- and S- Band frequencies are the traditional spectrum allotted for military T&amp;E use.  The explosive need for spectrum in the commercial sector has resulted in reallocation of portions of these bands to industry.  To compensate, DoD is now authorized to use the C-Band spectrum which offers numerous benefits, including the potential for a large increase in available bandwidth, but the C-Band spectrum comes with technical challenges and regulatory constraints.  Most notably, our current test infrastructure for telemetry is not designed to accommodate C-Band and the band is heavily shared for alternate uses.  Technologies are required to implement innovative techniques that efficiently facilitate our use of C-Band without a major overhaul to our national test infrastructure.  For instance, commercial telemetry transmitters operate in C-Band but do not have the form factor (size, weight and power) nor ruggedized packaging to survive airborne test applications.
  Traditional telemetry applications employ streaming telemetry where data is moved one-way from the instrumented system under test to our test range infrastructure.  Modern network based telemetry and cellular based telemetry capabilities enable more robust, efficient bidirectional transfer of data.  The DoD strategy is to create technologies for implementing a telemetry capability in C-Band, using the legacy L- and S-Bands for both streaming and networked telemetry, and researching the feasibility of using higher frequency bands to augment telemetry operations.
  The Spectrum Efficient Technology (SET) project is developing test technologies that enable more efficient use of legacy telemetry bands and expansion into non-traditional areas of the RF and optical spectra at DoD test ranges.  The technology development efforts within the SET project have been prioritized to align with Department of Defense guidance on science and technology priority investments. As such, the SET project is focusing on growing data requirements of warfighting systems and the limited availability of spectrum for testing.  The SET project is structured to develop test technologies to advance range communications, networked and cellular based telemetry capabilities, and enhanced management of spectrum at DoD test ranges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The SET project risk reduced a ruggedized Ethernet switch for airborne systems in support of the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) networked telemetry projects.  The ruggedized Ethernet switch addressed CTEIP requirements to fully instrument test aircraft with network enable instrumentation packages to support bi-directional telemetry.  The ruggedized switch provides the Ethernet backbone on the aircraft which supports the transport of packetized telemetry data from the onboard instrumentation systems to the telemetry transceiver which transmits the data to the control room.
  The SET project successfully demonstrated a software tool capable of accurately estimating current and future spectrum needs. The tool accounted for actual versus scheduled utilization of the spectrum and quantified the cost and schedule implications of the loss of needed spectrum. The spectrum efficient metrics tool provides spectrum managers a planning tool and also provides justification data needed to retain spectrum. The SET project also developed an optimized frequency planning tool supporting frequency re-use planning algorithms for telemetry networks and legacy telemetry systems. This planning tool provides next generation spectrum planning tools allowing for dynamic frequency re-allocation.
  The SET project completed risk reduction on a networked data recorder and data transmission scheme in support of CTEIP networked telemetry projects.  The networked data recorder addressed CTEIP requirements for data recording and parametric extraction during flight testing.  The networked data recorder was used as the primary data recorder during CTEIP flight tests.  The data transmission scheme is designed to minimize the amount and type of data transmitted over the telemetry network, reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed during a test event.  This technology enables more efficient use of the RF spectrum by reducing the amount of data transmitted by only transmitting data parameters when changes occur.</r2:Description>

  The SET project will initiate several efforts to develop the key technology components to use higher frequencies to support telemetry requirements.  These efforts will focus on power amplifier, airborne transmitter, and airborne antenna development.

The SET project will continue to develop technologies to address over-the-horizon telemetry requirements to support the testing of large footprint, long range missiles and hypersonic weapons.  A phased array antenna suitable for mounting on a UAS will continue development and its antenna gain performance characterized in a high fidelity laboratory and open air environment.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In order to establish dominance in the modern battlespace, our offensive and defensive electronic warfare systems must be capable against advanced radio frequency (RF) directed threats and electro-optic (EO) guided threats, which include infrared (IR) guidance.  Ensured dominance in these areas requires more robust test and evaluation (T&amp;E) with technologies that are rapidly adaptable to changing threats. 
  Readily available, IR seeking, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) are difficult to detect and pose an imminent and lethal threat to military aircraft of all types.  Our ability to counter such threats is essential to owning the battlespace in theater.  Therefore, the ability to test missile warning systems (MWS), hostile fire indicator (HFI) systems, IR countermeasures (IRCM), and advanced threat sensors is critical to our national defense. Additionally, a new generation of enemy RF missile seekers is both currently fielded and in further development, requiring a correspondingly new generation of test technologies to test the latest countermeasures.  The T&amp;E community is required to test IRCM and RF countermeasure systems in a repeatable manner with ground-truth data before and after integration into warfighting systems.  Without new test technologies, the Department of Defense (DoD) will be unable to perform adequate T&amp;E of advanced warning and countermeasure systems.
  The technology development efforts within the Electronic Warfare Test (EWT) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the EWT project is focusing on the test needs in both the EO, including IR, and the RF threat domains.  Additionally, development of core test technologies in this area can be leveraged to meet other EO and RF test requirements, such as in fire control systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors, and weapon seekers.
  The EWT project develops test technologies to stimulate IRCM and RF system sensors through the high-fidelity simulation of scenes viewed by the sensors.  Stimulation can be as simple as testing to see if a system under test responds to an image or as complex as simulating complex battle space phenomena to measure the response of a system under test in a more relevant, cluttered scenario.  Simulations and stimulations are used at open air ranges and in installed system test facilities (ISTF), and in hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) test beds.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Instrumentation Systems Technology (AIST) project addresses the test technology gaps resulting from emerging weapon systems that need to be tested at Department of Defense (DoD) open air ranges, undersea ranges, installed systems test facilities, hardware-in-the-loop laboratories, and measurement test facilities.  Instrumentation requirements for systems under test are increasing exponentially for new weapons systems.  Vehicle-borne and warfighter-wearable instrumentation packages are required.  This instrumentation is for sensing and collecting critical performance data; determining accurate time, space, position information (TSPI)and attitude information; interfacing with command and control data links; monitoring and reporting system-wide communications; recording human operator physical and cognitive performance; and storing and transmitting data.
  The technology development efforts within the AIST project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology (S&amp;T) communities of interest (COIs).  The AIST project is focused on supporting technology developments for advanced time, space, position information (TSPI) instrumentation (especially with limited or no availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS)), advanced sensors, advanced energy and power systems for instrumentation, non-intrusive instrumentation, mitigating range encroachment issues, and measuring warfighter physical and cognitive performance.   The AIST project addresses requirements for miniaturized, non-intrusive instrumentation suites with increased survivability in harsh environments.  Such instrumentation is an urgent need because minimal space is available to add instrumentation to new or existing weapon systems subsequent to their development; furthermore, additional weight and power from instrumentation can adversely affect weapon system signature and performance.  Instrumentation for humans-in-the-loop, such as dismounted warfighters, must not adversely affect performance, induce artificiality in the test environment, nor create operational burden.  New technologies can be exploited to integrate small, non-intrusive instrumentation into emerging platforms during design and development, and, in some cases, into existing platforms.  This class of instrumentation will provide critical system performance data during operational test (OT) and continuous assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle.  Technology developed under AIST can also benefit training and combat missions by enabling a continual feedback loop between the developer, training staff, operators and commanders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

  The AIST project transitioned a system to the U.S. Army’s Test &amp; Evaluation Command (ATEC) that measures and assesses warfighter cognitive performance under realistic conditions during a T&amp;E event.  A personnel tracking system using amplitude modulation (AM) band signals was developed and tested in a relevant environment before transition.  The AIST project continued development of technology to evaluate back face deformation of body armor from a blunt trauma event, with final testing planned at Aberdeen Test Center’s Light Armor Range Complex.
The AIST project continued an effort to develop a high fidelity model which takes into account the noisier acoustic properties of shallow water environments (120 feet to 900 feet) for littoral T&amp;E.  The model will support early evaluation of undersea test range technologies (e.g., hydrophone arrays, new communication signals/modulations, transducers, and portable instrumentation).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) is exploring the military utility, safety, and suitability of directed energy weapons.  A robust test capability to assess directed energy weapons is essential to understanding their effectiveness and limitations, including determining their effectiveness in performing counter improvised explosive device (C-IED) operations.  Such assessments will depend upon knowledge acquired through the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of directed energy technologies and testing of operational concepts.  Directed energy weapon technologies, primarily consisting of high energy lasers (HEL) and high powered microwaves (HPM), are outpacing available test capabilities.  Traditional test techniques for evaluating conventional munitions (with flight times ranging from seconds to minutes) are not sufficient for the T&amp;E of directed energy weapons that place energy on target instantaneously.  Consequently, new test technology solutions are needed to ensure that adequate developmental, live-fire, and operational test capabilities are available when directed energy programs are ready to test.
  Directed energy system and component testing requires three principal assessments:  (1) energy or power on target; (2) the effects on the target; and (3) the propagation of the directed energy to the target through the atmosphere.  In addition, the vulnerabilities of DoD systems to directed energy threats are required to be characterized, such as those requirements captured in Military Standard (MIL-STD)-464C.  Equally as important, current test capabilities do not provide the detailed data required to understand U.S. directed energy system performance and effects.  The technology development efforts within the Directed Energy Test (DET) project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on science and technology priority investments.  As such, the DET project is developing the technologies necessary for quantitative assessment of United States (U.S.) HEL and HPM performance, as well as the vulnerability of DoD weapon systems to enemy directed energy threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The DET project continued efforts to measure HEL energy on small targets such as mortars.  The effort designed a recoverable mortar prototype to address Army and Navy requirements and an Air Force requirement for a missile-mounted target board.  The DET project continued efforts to develop M&amp;S capability for assessing effects of threat HEL systems on blue aircraft.
  The DET project continued to mature a dense plasma focus technology to produce strategically relevant, ultra-short pulse neutron fluence levels for nuclear vulnerability testing.  The DET project successfully demonstrated neutron production and dense plasma focus technology development continues to be optimized to support neutron production rates scalable to a test facility to be developed by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  A larger chamber was integrated into the facility to test obtaining higher yields.  The DET project initiated efforts to support testing of an HPM system integrated with a munition.  The DET project initiated new developments in HPM envelope detection. A prototype vertical sensor net array was demonstrated with 4 prototype nodes. The prototype nodes achieved ‘first light’ at the High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML) facility at Kirtland AFB after being exposed to L-band radiation. This prototype sensor array provides rapid/ field expedient diagnostic of a High Power Microwave beam in the far field.</r2:Description>

The C4T technology gaps are driven by the more complex environments and distributed systems (e.g. Anti-Access Arial Denial (A2AD); Manned and Unmanned Systems (MUM-T)); big data and intelligence (e.g. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA)); and more software intensive systems (e.g. F-35).  The technology development efforts within the C4T project have been prioritized to align with DoD guidance on S&amp;T Communities of Interest (CoIs).  C4T is developing technologies, including leveraging advancements in machine learning, to analyze and evaluate the increasing mass of structured and unstructured data generated by C4I and SIS testing.  The technologies are required when testing sensor platforms, command and control systems and weapon platforms that support the kill chain in a Joint operation.  These systems must be evaluated for their ability to provide the accurate, timely transfer of data (e.g. target tracks, weapons allocation, mission tasking, and situational awareness) as the data passes among the Services and coalition participants.
The technologies within C4T will remove undesired distributed testing biases while improving test agility and the tester’s ability to effectively support knowledge management, rapid analysis of “Big Data," and automated test reporting.  The C4T project advances test automation features (test planning, test execution, Big Data collection, analysis, and visualization) that enable the virtual integration of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon laboratories and open air ranges.  Using Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) along with hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) laboratories, the effectiveness of Joint missions can be assessed in terms of system-of-systems interoperability and effectiveness in executing Joint mission operations, including testing of weapons and C4I and SIS systems accessing and providing information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This includes the development of an analyst assisting Time Space Position Information (TSPI) tool. The TSPI tool is based on a learning system that combines the analysts’ knowledge with the classification knowledge obtained from big data techniques and applies human-like reasoning to achieve an automated post mission processing tool.
    The C4T project continued development of M&amp;S technologies to support real-time assessments of complex environments such as undersea environments.  These technologies provided an acoustic propagation model, both narrow and broad band, of sufficient fidelity to test torpedo performance in various maritime tactical environments.  The model included a real-time simulation/emulation system for testing torpedo sonar systems in multiple bathometry, biological and threat environments.
  The C4T project completed development of technologies to provide a reliable, fast, and cost-effective approach that enables direct injection Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) testing of next generation weapon systems.    The C4T project continued development of a configuration optimization of test support networks.  Technologies included planning expeditionary tests, managing bandwidth and spectrum contention with a networked system under test, managing battery consumption, providing Real-Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) data during live tests and providing continuous re-planning capability. These technologies will address deficiencies in Army Operational Test (OT) for network-enabled technologies.
  The C4T project initiated the development of deep neutral network technologies for real-time Automated Target Recognition (ATR) using real and synthetic data.  These technologies are being developed to support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target recognition.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unmanned and autonomous systems support every domain of warfare -- operating in space, in air, on land, on the sea surface, undersea and in subterranean conditions to support a vast variety of missions.  The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings a host of revolutionary capabilities that will profoundly influence warfare.  The UAST project addresses current and emerging challenges associated with the test and evaluation (T&amp;E) of unmanned systems, particularly in testing autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  As such, the UAST project is developing test technologies to simulate, stimulate, instrument, measure, and assess an autonomous system’s ability to perceive its environment, process information, adapt to dynamic conditions, make decisions, and effectively act on those decisions in the context of mission execution.
  The UAST project will provide the test technologies to effectively measure performance and characterize risk, thereby increasing warfighter trust in autonomous systems and artificial intelligence tools.  Current DoD test capabilities and methodologies are insufficient to address the testing of increasingly autonomous units operating in unstructured, dynamic, battlespace environments.  Furthermore, advancements are being made in developing collaborating, system-of-autonomous-systems that will work in concert as a swarm or pack and in close proximity with humans.  New test technologies are needed to stress the collective set of autonomous systems under realistic conditions, predict emergent behavior of autonomous systems, emulate the complex environment, and assess mission performance of these highly coupled and artificially intelligent systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The AAIT project continued test technology development supporting the near term challenges identified in the 2013–2038 DoD Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, such as, integrating DoD unmanned systems within the National Airspace and safely operating unmanned aerial systems within the Major Range and Test Facility Bases (MRTFB).  The AAIT project collaborated with the Autonomy Community of Interest (COI) Test and Evaluation, Verification and Validation (TEVV) Working Group to ensure that the AAIT project is investing in technologies relevant to the future of autonomous systems.
  The AAIT project explored technologies required for T&amp;E of emerging UAS architectures, functional components, and interfaces.  The AAIT project emphasized autonomy test technologies that can be integrated for use in a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) environment within the MRTFB.  The AAIT project continued investments in robustness testing technology to detect and predict vulnerabilities and failures within UAS software.  The AAIT project transitioned developments to automatically predict test vehicle collision potentials and cue test range controllers to take corrective action.  These technologies prevent the test vehicle from violating flight envelopes, range boundaries, and warning areas.  The AAIT project completed an effort to develop a software tool that will enable testers to monitor the internal autonomous processing states of a system under test without interfering with its operations or requiring modification to the system’s software or hardware.  The AAIT project completed efforts that rapidly identify challenging test scenarios for an undersea unmanned vehicle (UUV) under test.  The effort identified performance boundaries for autonomy as they relate to the environment, mission, and vehicle state spaces; this technology transitioned to the Naval Undersea Warfare Center-Keyport.
  The AAIT project continued development of technology to address the T&amp;E of ground and air autonomy using optimization algorithms to rapidly generate salient test scenarios. Expansion to the ground domain continued with the integration of AAIT technology into the Autonomous Ground Resupply (AGR) autonomy within the Autonomous Navigation Virtual Environment Laboratory (ANVEL) simulation. The integrated autonomy simulation will be used to validate AAIT technologies in the ground domain. New architecture and state space designs better support multiple domains of autonomy testing. Unmanned Ground Vehicle and Undersea Vehicle domains test technology development will risk reduce CTEIP autonomous test capability development efforts.</r2:Description>

The AAIT project will continue to initiate and develop technologies to support autonomous system test planning, autonomous system test execution, and autonomous system performance assessment.  Efforts within test planning will include predicting autonomous behavior for testing and assuring thorough testing of autonomous systems.  Investments in test execution will include:  enhancing safety of autonomous system testing; creating test environments that are complex, immersive, and reactive; and adapting ranges to cognitive, autonomous system testing.  Developments under performance assessment will include: testing and evaluating UAS-to-UAS and human-to-UAS interactions and measuring autonomous system reliability.
  The AAIT project will investigate new technologies specifically for creating faster-than-real-time versions of autonomies.  Developing this technology will allow multiple copies of a black-box autonomy to be run in modeled environments to gather statistically significant information regarding the performance boundaries of an autonomy.
  The AAIT project will complete development of technologies that automatically learn conditions for activating vulnerabilities deep within an autonomous system, using machine learning and backward chaining techniques to determine system level inputs that induce failure.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) ability to use cyberspace for rapid communication and information sharing in support of operations is a critical enabler of DoD military missions.  Advancements in utilizing cyberspace are outpacing the technologies needed for test and evaluation (T&amp;E).  The Cyberspace Test Technology (CTT) project develops advanced technologies and methodologies to test and evaluate DoD capabilities and information networks to defend and conduct full-spectrum military operations across cyberspace.  Current cyberspace T&amp;E capabilities are insufficient to support the continual experimental, contractor, developmental, operational, and live-fire testing requirements of warfighter systems operating in cyberspace.  Many of the test tools and infrastructure items required for systems in cyberspace will require advancement and maturation of nascent test technologies.  The CTT project will address test technology shortfalls in cyberspace testing, including planning cyberspace tests, creating representative cyberspace threats and test environments, executing cyberspace tests, and performing cyberspace test analysis and evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The National Security Innovation Network (NSIN) is a program office within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering with a mission to build new networks of innovators that generate new solutions to national security problems.  NSIN develops programs and services that are designed to help other DoD entities from the Military Services, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, and Defense Agencies and Field Activities solve problems with non-traditional partners.  NSIN is organized around three core lines of effort.  These lines of effort include: 1) creating new opportunities for National Security Service by building models of service that account for generational and cultural differences between the military, academic, and venture communities and providing flexible pathways to official service within the Department of Defense; 2) solving national security problems by collaborating with partners from the academic and venture communities by engaging new problem-solvers in collision events with DoD customers that generate novel concepts and solutions and building a national network of problem-solving ecosystems that leverage the competitive advantages of regions and commercial innovation hubs for DoD customers; and 3) accelerating the adoption of novel concepts and solutions by facilitating engagement with DoD end users and transition partners to stimulate dual-use venture growth and improving Technology Transfer and Transition (T3) rates for DoD lab technology through dual-use commercialization via early-stage ventures.

NSIN, working in partnership with other DoD innovation initiatives, seeks to maintain the long-term competitive advantage for the US military over peer and near-peer adversaries by tapping into high-potential uniformed and civilian employees of the DoD (i.e. intrapreneurs) and exponentially increasing with non-traditional innovators and entrepreneurs outside of the DoD.  NSIN's programs and its physical and virtual network are the channels through which NSIN achieves its mission.

NSIN's physical network is composed of 11 Regional Directors, each of which is located in critical venture innovation hubs throughout the country (Boston, MA; NYC, Washington, DC; Raleigh, NC: Chicago, IL: St. Louis, MO: Austin, TX; Denver, CO; Seattle, WA: San Diego, CA: and San Francisco, CA) and supported by University Program Directors (UPDs) that are embedded at critical universities throughout the country and are co-located with emerging or extant venture ecosystems. At objective stated, NSIN envisions approximately 35 such UPDs throughout the country and in all 50 states.

NSIN, under its previous MD5 nomenclature, has been a Congressional interest program that has received funding in FY2016 ($5M), FY2017 ($25M), FY2018 ($25.5M), and FY 2019 ($15M) in the former PE 0603680D8Z.  FY2020 is the first year for the establishment of an independent PE for this program.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

- Through programs within NSIN’s Collaboration Portfolio (like Hacking for Defense (H4D), Hackathons, demonstration days, SBIR execution support for the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) and AFWERX), achieved a 73% solution adoption rate against more than 150 problems provided by DoD customers utilizing NSIN programming. This includes approximately 10% of solutions that have already transitioned back to DoD customers in the form of contracted dual-use ventures and/or budget allocations towards new programs or record. 

- Almost 50 new hires through fellowships, internships, and other project-based work from more than 13 different universities, including 9 new, full-time hires into the Department of Defense through NSIN’s new National Service Portfolio. 

- Net growth of 43 new, dual-use ventures launched in response to a direct, DoD customer demand signal as a result of NSIN’s focus through its Acceleration Portfolio on customer discovery and making DoD problems more legible for early-stage (Seed to A-Round) ventures seeking to do business with the DoD. 

- 14 dual-use ventures launched from extant DoD lab technology through the Defense Innovation Accelerator (DIA) program that is specifically designed to improve DoD lab technology transfer and transition (T3) rates.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The U.S. military’s dependence on liquid fuel creates an enormous logistics burden that exposes forces to enemy attack and diverts operational resources from other mission areas to support delivery. GAO cited the department for its lack of (1)”visibility and accountability for achieving fuel reduction, (2) incentives and a viable funding mechanism to invest in the implementation of fuel demand reduction projects, and (3) guidance and policies that addressed fuel demand.”

The mission of this program element (PE) since these findings in 2012 has been to fund innovation to improve the Department of Defense’s (DoD) operational effectiveness via targeted operational energy science and technology (S&amp;T) investments.  OECIF fostered innovation to improve operational energy performance in two ways:  first, to develop operational energy technologies and practices that improved the agility and resiliency of our ability to supply forces the energy they need; and second, to establish momentum for components to continue those innovations through ongoing collaboration with the Services, Joint Staff and Combatant Commands.  

OECIF funds served as “seed money” to start or consolidate promising innovations to serve as proof of technological feasibility, with the goal of transitioning science and technology (S&amp;T) into the acquisition process. The focus is on challenges or opportunities that are not Services specific, but rather cross Services, platforms and domains.      

OECIF investments also highlighted areas of Departmental level interest or buy down risk to enable service-level commitments. The primary focus on 6.3 Investments facilitated joint solutions and incentivized cross Service collaboration to transition the acquisition valley of death. OSD investment (37%) in conjunction with investment from DLA, Army, Navy, and USMC of 22% represents almost 60% of the DoD-wide OE 6.3 investment budget.  The Air Force contributes about 40% with 55% of their contribution focused on high-cost engine testing and architecture for high power systems.  

OECIF investments are directly focused on the capability needs expressed in the NDS.  Our ability to predict, detect, and mitigate an adversary’s ability to deny tactical and operational formations the energy needed to prosecute operations at tempo and scale throughout every phase of warfare and to enable freedom of action at all echelons, unencumbered by the challenges of delivering energy across an unbounded multi-domain and contested battlespace.  

To achieve these goals, the selection process for investments relied on inputs from the Combatant Commands and Services each year through a competitive process.  The OECIF decision process supports the National Security Strategy for energy dominance, all three National Defense Strategy priorities, the DoD Energy Strategy, Department Modernization Priorities, and the needs of the Joint Force and warfighters.  The projects compete on the basis of greatest impact to the warfighter, criticality of operational need, least technical risk, least cost, and the shortest time to employment.  

OECIF success has been measured by its impact.  The overall aim has been to improve the agility, resilience, lethality, readiness, and operational effectiveness of the Joint Force. The key metric is the successful transition of technology from S&amp;T to an acquisition or direct insertion into operations.  Over 75% of OECIF investments have successfully transitioned to support the warfighter.  
   
OECIF’s efforts have complimented, not replaced or duplicated, Services investments and have provided a continuingly evolving program to rapidly address new and critical issues arising from emerging threats to our ability to supply the joint force. 

Examples of current investments include moving power without mass (power beaming); world-record setting efficiencies for solar power conversion; use of energy scavenging within the warfighting environment, and use of sensors, data analytics and predictive methodologies with the promise of enabling unparalleled operational unpredictability to counter an adversaries “energy denial” operations. Additional leading technologies enabling extended remote operations without resupply through innovations in the use of energy storage, micro-grids, and nuclear power fuel innovation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Fund new OECIF initiatives and continue established efforts.  OECIF will self-fund necessary overhead from the program baseline, approximately $5.000 million annually, to include program management, business reform tools, and strategic partnerships, etc.  

Established efforts include:
• The FY 2013 OECIF project, Tactical Microgrid Standardization, will submit a draft Military Standard (MIL-STD) to the Defense Standardization Program Office for approval.  A multi-national demonstration is planned for inter-operability among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) partners showing applicability of the standard as part of the Capable Logistician 2019 exercise.

• FY 2014 OECIF projects are focused on analytical methods and tools for considering operational energy in DoD planning and decision processes.  Analytic tools were developed to consider energy vulnerability during the Joint Planning Process. Spring warfighter evaluations and training are planned.  DoD-wide model, scenario, and data updates continue with new model versions scheduled to be released in October 2019.  Analytical tool investment underpins the Congressionally mandated energy key performance parameter in addition to warfighting battlefield tools.

• FY 2015 OECIF tactical vehicle improvement projects completed the final year of OECIF funding.  One effort completed a critical milestone for procurement testing and successfully identified Program Manager Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (PM THAAD) as its first transition partner.  A system demonstration is planned for FY 2019.  Battlefield electrification yields increased operating longevity in addition to decreased mean-time between failure and significantly less frequent refueling requirements.

• FY 2016 OECIF projects focused on improving the operational energy performance of unmanned aerial, surface, undersea and ground vehicles.  Multiple projects will conclude in FY 2019 with efforts resulting in improved engine design, energy hybridization for increased performance capabilities, and fuel efficiencies.  These projects are expected to transition in FY 2020-2021.

• FY 2017 OECIF projects support two main topics:  Thermal and Power Management Technologies for High Pulse Power Systems; and Wireless Transmission of Energy in the Far-Field.  These investments focus on the energy and power sub-systems that enable directed energy weapons as well as future warfighting concepts with unlimited power and communications.  Efforts are demonstrating early success and pushing technology forward across wireless transmission in far-field, laser beaming, space solar, and photovoltaic testing.

Increased lethality of directed energy weapons is enabled by advanced power and thermal innovation in: 
• Lab-based prototypes of thermal management systems to bolster mission-success of DEW systems;
• Hybrid energy storage module units to enable continuous firing of pulse load capability and reduced logistics; and
• Energy management systems for high power payloads that increase fuel savings as well as improve power and thermal transient capability.

Resiliency is bolstered by far field wireless energy development of: 
• Alternative manufacturing methods for lightweight flexible high efficiency III-V solar cells that provide a breakthroughs in cost reduction as well as decreased production time for the next generation space solar concepts;
• Alternative solar cell materials, such as perovskites that increase mobile power generation capability by a factor of three as well as decreasing weight and increasing efficiency; and
• Mobile power meters for preventative maintenance and agile logistics.

Innovative operational concepts can be realized with new battlefield technologies including: 
• Advances in novel space solar collection and wireless power beaming technologies which lead to increased energy resiliency and assured energy supply;
• Studies on space solar on energy resupply capability that provide knowledge towards future investment strategies;
• Laser light power beaming technologies including the receiver, transmitter and safety system that enable infinite persistence communications and ISR assets;
• Millimeter wave power beaming technologies including rectenna and sterling engine prototypes to enable persistent operations; and
• Free-space optical communication system that provides a highly directional, jam-resistant, secure communications via an energy stream.

Finally, business reform is driven by the development of an artificial intelligence portfolio analysis tool that will speed operational energy S&amp;T developments and improve investment decisions.

Innovative advances in power and thermal management as well as wireless transmission of energy underpin lethal warfighting capability and are expected to contribute to increased power generation and distribution capabilities, reduced energy supply line burdens, and new autonomous power paradigms.  The breadth of applications include directed energy / electronic weaponry, persistent autonomous systems, power generation and distribution on the ground and in space, and advanced communication systems. 

• FY 2018 OECIF projects are one-year studies to identify operational energy S&amp;T gaps in the near-, mid-, and far-term.  The studies will deliver community vetted, operational energy investment roadmaps.  Once these projects are completed, they will be the pathway to feed the next operational energy strategy and they will inform the topic selection for FY 2020 OECIF proposals.

• FY 2019 OECIF projects directly support "Enhanced Energy Storage to Improve Lethality and Warfighting Performance" consistent with the National Defense Strategy.  Investments focus on standardization, safety, and advanced performance of energy storage solutions with consideration for business reform opportunities. 

Business reform is driven by rapid demonstration of:
• The use of rapidly manufactured and field expendable logistics: surface/sub-surface vehicles for bulk fuel delivery;
• Demonstration of innovative inverter technology for vehicle-to-grid energy storage and micro-gridding enabling technology for autonomous vehicle recharging;
• Application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to demonstrate increased development speeds for rapid-recharge antiferroelectric capacitors;
• Unique aerodynamic designs for on-board UAS energy fuel storage;
• Hybrid power management and storage for Group 3 UAS; and
• Mechanical demonstrations of in-flight energy storage for both platforms and weapon systems.  

OECIF supports storage safety innovation in:
• Novel aqueous battery chemistries that do not burn and have no fixed dependence on form factor, offering the warrior and platforms greater safety and flexibility;
• Energy storage devices to support expeditionary basing requirements; and
• Novel Li-Ion internal short detection system which senses at extremely low sensitivity levels allowing early warning to mitigate malfunctions or dangers.

Energy storage is also a key component of energy resiliency and FY 2019 OECIF investments support:
• Innovative hydrogen energy storage at bases;
• Mobile power monitoring of energy storage and loads for preventative maintenance and agile logistics;  
• Integration of monolithically integrated, ultra-thin solar powered solid state lithium energy storage for space solar applications; and
• Mechanical developments supporting flywheel storage technology.

Finally, FY 2019 OECIF emphasizes standardization with the potential to save the department millions of dollars including:
• Standardization of Li-Ion 6T drop-in replacement batteries;
• Standardization of Li-Ion storage containers for world-wide shipping and development of a DoD-wide Li-Ion database; and
• Standardization of high voltage energy storage module to support Directed Energy/Electronic Warfare.

Innovative advances in energy storage underpins lethal warfighting capability and the FY 2019 efforts are expected to significantly contribute to silent watch, greater and safer on-board power for payloads, increased unrefueled range and endurance, reduced energy supply line burdens, and the ability to support autonomous operations.  The breadth of applications includes directed energy / electronic weaponry, the dismounted warfighters combat load, long range and endurance of autonomous systems, and storage of energy in and from space.

The Services submitted a record $175.000 million in prioritized proposal requests for energy storage types (batteries, fuel cells, ultra-capacitors, flywheels, compressed gases, thermal storage, betavoltaics, pumped hydro energy/power density, safety, standardization, hybridization, reliability, cyclic behavior, and efficiency).  Concerted industry outreach efforts with the Defense Innovation Unit and Manufacturing Technology programs increase the likelihood of near-term transition.</r2:Text>

FY 2017 projects for far-field wireless energy transmission will be completed.  These include efforts across 3 modalities of power beaming (Laser, mmWave, and RF).  World-records set in eye-safe Laser power will increase in power and distance.  Efforts in mmWave, RF will demonstrate at least 1kW @ 1 km.  World-record setting perovskite solar cell efforts will conclude with delivery and test of multi-junction cells.  New manufacturing for space-based solar cells will transition to the Air Force partner to continue this effort for reducing costs applicable to all space launches by an order of magnitude.

                                <r2:Description>Previous FY 2017-FY 2019 P455 OECI investments focused on reducing weight and improving growth and performance of solar cells.  Early investment also focused on technological advances to improve metrology for energy collection in space, and both efforts continue advancing.  Success of previous OECI investments in laser safety and mmWave transmission has increased confidence for demonstrating a longer/larger project viability. 

The Space Solar / Power Beaming project implements a front-loaded sprint to recapture the lead in critical technologies with both near-term tactical and far-term strategic implications.  Near-peer competitors are overmatching DoD in power beaming and space solar technologies for battlefield advantage, necessitating this effort to address the shortfalls.  Per the findings and recommendations of the recent DoD study “Opportunities and Challenges for Space Solar for Remote Installations," measured, comprehensive investments will be made in key areas to accomplish demonstrations that jumpstart the effort.</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Complete efforts begun in FY 2017 for power beaming and space solar (see above).  These elements advance efforts for power beaming and space solar capabilities to increase warfighter lethality and reduce logistical burdens.

For ground-to-ground, elevated, high-altitude, low earth orbit, and higher orbits, the progression of power beaming capabilities to include longer links and higher powers will provide a credible path to an operational capability.  

(1) Space Solar Collection – Low-cost, lightweight photovoltaics through revolutionary production methods are key to manufacturing at scale.  
(2) Microwave Power Beaming Link Demonstration – Using existing sources, microwave power beaming will be demonstrated using rectenna receiver modules developed during FY 2020. This represents the first step towards an all-weather, global system..
(3) Millimeter Power Beaming Link Demonstration – Leveraging proven non-lethal transmission sources, a tactically relevant power beaming demonstration will be undertaken using millimeter wave rectenna receiver modules developed during FY 2020. 
(4) Optical Power Beaming Link Demonstration – Integrating proven laser safety systems with appropriate directed energy assets will form the transmission segment for the optical demonstration. The optical receiver will be developed employing recent advances in monochromatic photovoltaic technology.  
(5) Architecture Analytics &amp; Integrating Technologies – Scenario modeling of different means of energy conversion and ground and space segment approaches will focus investments and drive concept of operations development.  Leap-ahead technologies in large area metrology, high-altitude receiver craft, thermal management, high voltage management, and airborne tether technologies will be examined for potential integration into near-term deployed power beaming and far-term space solar capabilities.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems portfolio aligns with the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”
 
The CWMD Systems portfolio enhances warfighter lethality by developing capabilities to analyze and exploit critical nodes of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and ballistic missile programs and proliferation networks; and developing offensively-oriented capabilities to disrupt WMD proliferation networks and detect, disable, or defeat WMD and delivery systems. Investments result in capabilities fielded to the Joint Force, enabling it to reduce WMD threats and create options for the United States to prevent WMD use.
 
The Office of the Secretary of Defense uses the CWMD Systems portfolio to invest strategically in projects across the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and Defense Agencies. Funding is prioritized for projects that close Joint Force warfighter capability gaps. An annual investment strategy is used to meet emergent operational and capability needs submitted by the Joint Force, yielding new fielded capabilities within one to two years.
 
The CWMD Systems: Advanced Technology Development program invested in innovative technologies and non-materiel initiatives, accelerating development of new capabilities to illuminate WMD networks; assessed vulnerabilities in networks, programs, facilities, and weapons systems; and developed technologies to disable or defeat WMD. Funding also sponsors research, analyses, and table-top exercises related to countering WMD proliferation by government and non-government organizations. 
 
This appropriation funded labor, materials, and travel to support the requirements of this program, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contract with the government, for activities and acquisitions including RDT&amp;E, assessments and analyses, research studies, education, and other activities related to capability development and fielding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Transferred $5.700 million each year through the FYDP from PE 0603161D8Z to 0605161D8Z to better align analytical work being done.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development and rapid fielding throughout the DoD for an integrated and systemic approach for countering nuclear threats and the development of nuclear and conventional physical security material solutions.  Public Law, Presidential and DoD-level guidance, and Combatant Command and Service requirements drive the priorities for these programs.

Under this PE, funding associated with nuclear and convention physical security material solution for the Department is broken down into seven capability areas: (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The material solutions either (a) lead to a Programs of Record transitioning to Program Element 0604161D8Z for Systems Development and Demonstration; (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort, ensuring systems integration, and promoting interoperability and sustainability.

DoD's laboratory capability is limited by capacity and technical expertise. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, Departments and Agencies began to shift research and development from NTNF to other mission areas. This resulted in degradation of the DoD's (and by default, the U.S. Government's) ability to execute the nuclear forensics mission and deter adversaries.  Reemphasizing the importance of this mission is crucial to the success of this program.

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including staffing, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development, and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Countering Nuclear Threats (CNT) Program is the integrated and layered program across the full range of the Department of Defense (DoD) to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from radiological or nuclear (RN) incidents delivered through unconventional means, regardless of origin. It is also the only DoD Budget Activity 4 RDT&amp;E Program Element focused on improving CNT capabilities which addresses capability gaps identified by the Services, Combatant Commands, and the Joint Staff. These capabilities are necessary for the DoD to plan and execute effective operations against rogue regimes that pursue nuclear weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>CNT supported advanced development of Joint RN passive and active defense systems. Specifically, the joint Radioisotope Identification Devices (RIIDs) program will provide DoD forces with a modernized capability to identify radioisotopes in the field. This capability is necessary for missions to prevent use of radiological &amp; nuclear weapons, safeguard the force, and manage the consequences of an inadvertent or intentional release of RN materials. RIIDs will replace obsolescent systems with modern systems that have enhanced capabilities with improved interoperability.</r2:Description>

- Advanced development of improved DoD capabilities that will enable DoD to maintain a competitive edge over proliferating nations through the early identification of illicit activities to enable operations to be planned against nations proliferating to deny the acquisition of nuclear materials and weapons.  Specifically: 
-- Project that develops a capability to identify previously undetectable uranium production facilities through the operationalization of new techniques that lower existing detection thresholds, enable Combatant Commands (CCMDs) detection of adversary activities in their area of responsibility, and support CNT planning.
-- Project that develops a new capability that utilizes innovative means that will enable CCMD's to maintain awareness of State-level nuclear activities.  This project is focused on National Defense Strategy priorities but has potential global applications.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) is the only Department of Defense (DoD) program focused on advanced development of new capabilities that support the U.S. Government's ability to deter adversaries through our ability to attribute the use or attempted use of nuclear weapons or the source of any nuclear or radiological attack. 

The ability to identify the source of nuclear material from radioactive debris is critical to our national defense and security. Swift and accurate forensic and attribution (identification) capabilities are vital to supporting the President and Secretary of Defense in developing an appropriate national response to a nuclear event and to prevent future attacks in a timely manner.

An effective attribution capability provides the United States (U.S.) Government deterrent against nations who may use proxies or other non-traditional delivery of nuclear weapons against the U.S., U.S. interests, or allies. Additionally, this program sustains perishable U.S. technical expertise at the operational DoD laboratories required to respond to a post-detonation NTNF event. 

DoD's laboratory capability is limited by capacity and technical expertise. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, Departments and Agencies began to shift research and development from NTNF to other mission areas. This resulted in degradation of the DoD's (and by default, the U.S. Government's) ability to execute the nuclear forensics mission and deter adversaries.  Reemphasizing the importance of this mission is crucial to the success of this program. 

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The Modular Whole Air Collection System provides a complimentary, modular capability to collect air samples. Both of these projects are being leveraged by the Air Force Fleet Modernization initiative started in FY 2019.  

The United States Prompt Diagnostics System is a ground-based sensor solution that significantly enhances detection of prompt nuclear detonation signals in urban environments. The system transferred to the Air Force in FY 2019 and is currently undergoing an operational and readiness review.</r2:Description>

• Conduct the Nuclear Testing, Diagnostics, Forensics and Stockpile Stewardship Course.  This course seeks to enhance the education of the Military &amp; Federal workforce in areas critical to the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and also to include applications to synergistic capabilities such as technical nuclear forensics in order to facilitate technical and professional development and increase understanding of the history of nuclear weapons development, testing and design, and the interdependence between technical nuclear forensics and the nuclear weapons program as an integral component.</r2:Text>

A passive detection system will enable persistent monitoring of a considerably expanded geographic footprint at a significantly reduced cost when compared to current systems.  
- Advanced development of new DoD NTNF laboratory capabilities, through implementing new analytical techniques and leveraging emerging technologies and methods, which will decrease the time to develop high confidence results by a multiple of weeks. These projects also sustain perishable technical expertise necessary for DoD to accomplish the post-detonation NTNF mission. Laboratory improvement projects include: 
- Integration of R&amp;D methods to improve existing radiochemistry flowsheets to reduce timelines and recover additional isotopes.
- Developing tools to integrate data from multiple, disparate sources and streamline analyses to decrease the time required to report conclusions to decision makers to support attribution.</r2:Text>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>As a result of the FY 2021 Defense Wide Review (DWR) this program was reduced by $0.351 million dollars.  The DWR focused on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage."  

An additional re-alignment of funds in the amount of $6.176 million dollars was transferred to BA 8, PE 0608648D8Z, in support of the Software and Digital Technology Pilot Program.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates promising and innovative environmental and energy technologies that targets the Department of Defense (DoD) most urgent needs.  Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) demonstrates and validates promising and innovative environmental and energy technologies that target DoD's most urgent needs.   Technologies selected are projected to provide a return on the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies. The program responds to: (1) Congressional concern over the slow pace of remediation of environmentally polluted sites on military installations, (2) Congressional direction to conduct demonstrations specifically focused on emerging new technologies, and (3) the need to improve defense readiness by reducing the drain on the Department's operation and maintenance dollars caused by environmental restoration, waste management, and the cost of energy. Preference for demonstrations is given to technologies that have successfully completed all necessary research and development objectives, and address the highest priority DoD requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This initiative responds to Congressional direction for the Department to increase energy efficiency, reduce installation energy intensity, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve energy security. Emerging energy technologies offer DoD a cost effective opportunity to meet these requirements on its installations while reducing energy and operational costs. The DoD test bed program validates and tests the operational cost and performance of innovative energy technologies in a real-world integrated building environment so as to reduce risk, overcome the barriers to deployment, and facilitate wide-scale deployment. The test bed program exploits the Department's existing built infrastructure to evaluate energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies under the varied climatic conditions and building types DoD manages. The test bed's key elements are: 1) competitive selection of new technologies, 2) systematic and consistent evaluation to determine performance, operational readiness and life cycle costs, and 3) development of guidance and design information for future deployment across installations.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Defense-Wide Reviews (DWR) - Funding for the Initiative will end in FY 2021 resulting from the DWR, which focused on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage.  These funds will transfer to the Dept. of the Army.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Humanitarian Demining Research and Development (HD R&amp;D) Program is overseen by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Stability and Humanitarian Affairs (SHA) within the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low – Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC) in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) for Policy.  The HD R&amp;D Program coordinates with SHA and the with Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Geographical Combatant Commands (CCMD) to develop, demonstrate and validate cost-effective technologies for use in humanitarian demining via OCONUS operational field evaluations. The HD R&amp;D Program’s low-cost and highly effective technology reduces landmine and UXO threat to the local population and US forces, and bolsters host nations’ mine action capacity while improving DoD’s visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the USG, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments.  The program directly supports the National Defense Strategy through ensuring common domains remain open and free.

The HD R&amp;D Program crafts a research and development plan based on CCMDs’ security cooperation and theater campaign plan objectives to advance the state-of-the-art of demining technology and evaluate prototype technology utilizing host nation humanitarian demining operations partners.  Continuous operations test data against live mines/UXO around the world is unavailable to any other DoD organization. Such data informs HD R&amp;D Program investment decisions and is leveraged by U.S. military countermine R&amp;D programs to improve U.S. forces’ technology.  In addition, the program conducts mine and UXO detector training at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of mil-to-mil training and partnerships.  Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 227 evaluations in 42 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola and Zimbabwe.  The program’s technologies have cleared 66.8 million square meters of the world’s toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 205,474 mines and UXO.

New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at a biennial Requirements Workshop and a biennial UXO Working Group Meeting held by OASD SO/LIC.  The meetings involve representatives from Department of State (DOS), CCMD Humanitarian Mine Action programs, international mine action organizations and mine-affected nations.  The program element’s work fulfills the Department of Defense’s strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with DODI 3000.05 to foster security, economic security and development, and build indigenous capacity; and with § 407 and CJCSI 3207.01C to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Following a rapid prototyping strategy, the program emphasizes the use/modification of existing, commercially-available equipment and components to build functional prototype equipment suited for humanitarian demining operations.  This approach is required due to the immediate need for new demining technologies in the face of ongoing U.S. forces and host nation citizen casualties in mine-affected countries.  The program evaluates prototype equipment by acquiring it off-the-shelf from industry using competition to the extent possible, by leveraging ongoing countermine R&amp;D efforts in other U.S. and foreign R&amp;D activities, and by taking advantage of extensive in-house fabrication capabilities at the Army's Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Division (NVESD).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Coalition Warfare Program (CWP) supports DoD organizations that:  1) work with foreign partners to collaboratively address strategic technology gaps for current and future missions; 2) develop interoperability solutions for coalition operations; and 3) develop and strengthen defense relationships. CWP comprehensively addresses all three National Defense Strategy lines of effort: to develop a more lethal joint force; strengthen alliances and attract new partners; and implement business practices for greater performance and affordability. Coalition warfare and multinational operations are fundamental features of the U.S. National Security Strategy. Coalitions provide a broad base of technological, operational, and logistical support for military operations and ease the U.S. financial and manpower burdens associated with meeting military goals and objectives. Coalitions and relationships with international partners are high priorities for the nation and the Department of Defense.

CWP supplements a U.S. Government proponent’s funding for cooperative efforts, ensuring U.S. funds are sufficient to complete the engagement with the foreign partner(s).  When CWP funds are used to help fund a cooperative project, that project leverages technical and financial contributions of the foreign partner(s) and speeds the development and delivery of technical solutions to the warfighter.  For every $1 CWP has invested in cooperative projects, the program has leveraged $3 in foreign partner resources – from 76 foreign partners – and $2 in other U.S. Government resources, providing an overall 5:1 return on investment.  CWP funding enables DoD project teams to move a technology into the next stage of development or to complete and transition a technology to operational forces. These projects may also form the basis for future cooperation with international partners.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Next Generation (NextG) Information Communications Technologies (ICT) program will conduct large-scale experimentation and prototyping of dual-use (military and commercial) fifth-generation of cellular network (5G) technology for military uses.  The program will develop and deploy ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) 5G networks at DoD sites to evaluate and enhance 5G systems and technologies for domestic and expeditionary DoD missions.  This will include both the direct use of commercially available capabilities and DoD-specific technology enhancements that highly leverage commercial capabilities.  The program will also develop, test, and evaluate technology solutions to identify and mitigate the security challenges that 5G and NextG technologies will present in order to enable the military to operate through zero-trust networks. The program will:

• Deploy flexible 5G infrastructure at approximately eight U.S. military facilities to enable varied applications and networking prototypes
• Evaluate at least sixteen different DoD 5G applications at DoD facilities across the Services 
• Invest in DoD-focused 5G tactical, operational and strategic networking prototypes to expand the utility of commercial technologies for DoD missions 
• Demonstrate the capacity to “operate through” in contested environments using dynamic spectrum utilization and by learning how to both defend and exploit 5G networks through security vulnerability assessment

The program will deliver fieldable prototype capabilities that will remain in place at designated DoD locations as well as lessons learned to promulgate 5G knowledge and tradecraft.  This will ensure that both near-term and future generations of information and communications technologies will be capable of supporting US military and national security objectives.

The program will be executed through established support agreements with DoD Service laboratories and through existing DoD and Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) (including General Services Administration (GSA) contracts) that are suitable and cost-effective for 5G technology prototyping and telecommunications network equipment procurement and integration.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Develop and experiment with “dual-use” applications that demonstrate direct use of commercial systems and applications that use a large fraction of commercial capabilities that are augmented with DoD enhancements.  Dual-use applications will be evaluated within a deployed 5G infrastructure with operationally relevant numbers of users and geographic scale.  These use cases include: 

• Mission Planning/Training: Develop and experiment with ultra-high reliability, low latency, high bandwidth, as well as augmented and virtual reality technologies that enable high fidelity mission planning and training in realistic adversarial environments over 5G networks.
• Depot Operations: Leverage 5G technologies to upgrade depots for “smart” operations including autonomous repair and maintenance activities as well as warehouse movement via driverless forklifts, pallets, and tactical trucks.
• Global Asset/Supply Chain Management:  Leverage emerging 5G enterprise solutions to provide real time, optimum, continuous asset visibility and movement tracking, supply status, movement and resupply, and reduce inventory control costs.
• Smart Installations (e.g., logistics bases, ports): Develop and experiment with 5G enabled massive machine-to-machine communications, cloud and edge computing, and autonomy to enhance installation operations to maximize logistics traffic throughput.

Dual Use 5G research, development, and experimentation activities will deliver fieldable prototype capabilities that will remain in place at designated DoD locations.  Those that do not perform sufficiently well will still provide lessons learned to promulgate 5G knowledge and tradecraft.  These deliverables will inform base/camp/station modernization and recapitalization investments as prototypes transition to enduring infrastructure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

These capabilities will be based on technologies such as multi-networking across wired and wireless systems, network monitoring including new AI and firewall techniques, and dynamic spectrum utilization.  Develop tactical, operational, and strategic networking prototypes to demonstrate capabilities to dynamically share congested spectrum between military systems and commercial wireless networks.  

Capabilities will be prototyped and evaluated at-scale within highly dynamic and contested RF environments.  The Congested/Contested Spectrum research, development, and experimentation activities will deliver fieldable prototype capabilities that will remain in place at designated DoD locations.  Those that do not perform sufficiently well will still provide lessons learned to promulgate 5G knowledge and tradecraft.  These deliverables will inform base/camp/station modernization and recapitalization investments as prototypes transition to enduring infrastructure.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The purpose of this program is to develop a comprehensive capability to prevent and mitigate corrosion and its effects on Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems and infrastructure.  Corrosion severely impacts system and facility reliability, readiness and safety, and consumes a disproportionate amount of material and labor hours for repair and treatment of corrosion damaged systems and facilities.  The cost of corrosion across the DoD is currently in excess of $19 billion per year (down from approximately $22 billion in Fiscal Year 2007). The impacts and costs are so pervasive that Congress enacted Public Law 107-314 Sec: 1067 Prevention and mitigation of corrosion of military infrastructure and equipment [portions codified in 10 U.S.C. 2228].  This legislation requires that DoD develop a long-term corrosion strategy to include establishment of a coordinated R&amp;D program with transition plans.  The legislation also requires that DoD designate a responsible official or organization to oversee a corrosion prevention and mitigation program.  The responsibilities of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight and the Military Department Corrosion Prevention and Control Executives were further delineated in DODI 5000.67 "Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on Military Equipment and Infrastructure" of 01 February 2010.
 
A major responsibility of the Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight (CPO) is to select high payoff research and development projects that promise to prevent or mitigate corrosion and significantly reduce the total cost of corrosion along with the adverse impact of corrosion effects on weapon system and infrastructure operational capability.  This office chartered a Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPCIPT) that has selected and funded Operation and Maintenance projects for each Fiscal Year (FY) commencing in FY 2005. However, the DoD CPCIPT has determined that the biggest payoff in corrosion prevention and mitigation will come from investing in up-front prevention technologies, materials, and processes to leverage downstream cost avoidance in corrosion maintenance and repair.  Likewise, development of improved predictive and prognostic techniques can eliminate unseen failure and reduce unnecessary maintenance and repair costs.  Thus, technology development, demonstration, and transition projects have been selected and funded since FY 2006.  These projects address critical corrosion issues in both Department of Defense systems and infrastructure.  A number of low-risk, high-payoff technologies promise to vastly improve the service life and significantly reduce the maintenance costs and improve the availability and safety of weapon systems and facilities essential to maintain support for the warfighter.  A total of 85 projects have been completed including a follow-on assessment of their return on investment estimates.  The overall return on investment as estimated by the Military Departments is 17.2:1.

In addition, the University Corrosion Collaboration (now the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC)) was formed as collaboration between universities, Armed Forces Academies and DoD laboratories focused on corrosion technology research and development, and building a workforce with corrosion expertise for the DoD.  Research areas include performance prediction, assessment of finishes, surface engineering, and product support.  This advanced corrosion research has been ongoing since FY 2008 and performed by teams from TCC participating organizations.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Acquisitions are accomplished in three categories including projects, research opportunities, and activities as described in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.

Projects are funded jointly by CPO and the Military Departments and are led by subject matter experts at the Military Department laboratories.  CPO issues a call for proposed project plans in April and projects are submitted in June.  The project plan format is contained in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan.  CPO receives project plans and convenes evaluation selection panel to review proposed projects and make recommendations regarding project selection.  Projects are evaluated on factors including project performance period, ratio of OSD funding to Service funding, return-on-investment (ROI), degree to which the proposed technology addresses high-cost corrosion problems, potential benefits, joint service applicability, and probability of transition.  Upon acceptance and approval of the projects, funding is distributed to the Military Departments by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) based on funding priorities associated with the evaluation process results.  Project execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Research opportunities are funded through the Technical Corrosion Collaboration (TCC).  A call for white paper proposals is issued by CPO through an existing U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Submissions are evaluated by a technical panel.  Evaluation factors include quality of proposed research, potential impact on DoD corrosion problems, level of student involvement, and proposed collaboration between the research institutions and DoD laboratories.  Projects are ranked by the selection panel and funded based on merit and available funds.  Research institutions receive funds for the TCC through the establishment of cooperative agreements with USAFA.  Research execution is monitored through submission of quarterly quad charts and by conducting an annual review.   

Activities are those work efforts associated with the Working Integrated Product Teams (WIPT) under the CPCIPT and include policy, training, specifications and standards, metrics, science and technology, facilities, and communication and outreach.  WIPT Leads submit funding requirements associated with their annual tactical plan submission to CPO.  The proposed activities are prioritized by CPO and funded based on merit and available funds.  Activities are accomplished by both government and contractor personnel.  Funds are transferred to government personnel through the MIPR process.  Funds are transferred to contractor personnel through competitively awarded contracts including the multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement held by OASD(S).  Progress on activities is reviewed tri-annually at meetings of the CPCIPT.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Missile Defeat Project counters the growing global advancement and proliferation of road-mobile ballistic missile threats.  The Missile Defeat Project coordinated and integrated Department of Defense and Intelligence Community efforts to develop counter-threat capability.  In order to carry out the important role initiated by Missile Defeat, in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017, the Missile Defeat Project transferred activities initiated under Missile Defeat to other stakeholders starting in FY 2019.  In FY 2021 residual resources and capabilities are transferred to Program Element 0603338D8Z (Defense Modernization and Prototyping) in support of an expanded Multi-Domain Time Sensitive Targeting and Defeat (TSTD) alignment of key technology development and modernization effort.

Activities will be coordinated with the Services, appropriate Agencies, and the Combatant Commands to transition these developments into viable warfighting capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports microelectronics modernization activities that enable defense systems to keep pace with commercial microelectronics technological advances, reduce reliance on obsolete microelectronics, and mitigate the Department’s reliance on sole source foundries for assured state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It addresses the challenges of 1) having enduring access to a multiplicity of modern manufacturing processes that require commercial volumes to maintain long term viability and 2) protecting the intellectual property (IP) of the microelectronic parts that are manufactured.

This PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities, the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency, and the NDS strategic approach of reforming the Department’s business practices by simultaneously increasing performance and affordability while still minimizing risk.

This PE supports the OUSD(R&amp;E) Microelectronics Modernization Roadmap.  The primary areas of focus of this roadmap include the following:  access to advanced packaging and test; quantifiable assurance and secure design; foundry access; verification and validation; policies, standards, and Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) governing body; access to radiation hardened microelectronics; access to non-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics; disruptive research and development; education and workforce development; trusted foundry and obsolescence; and supply chain awareness and security.

Recognizing that an assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG. 

This activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>In FY 2021 Program Element (PE) funding for Project 291 – “Joint Federated Assurance Center”, Project 645 – “Verification and Validation Capabilities and Standards for Trust”, Project 646 – “New Trust Approach Development”, and Project 647 -“Microelectronics Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC)” will realign under four new project codes to correctly align PE funding in support of a zero-trust philosophy and reflective of current priorities. The new project codes are:  (1) P907 Access to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Microelectronics - Development; (2) P908 Access to Advanced Packaging and Testing - Development; (3) P911 Address DoD Unique Needs Especially Radiation Hardening - Development; and (4) P912 Create a Resilient and Robust Microelectronics Pipeline - Development.

Project codes P291, P645, P646, and P647 are being realigned in FY 2021 to the four new project codes to refocus the PE and provide traceability to the current enhancement priorities of SOTA access, heterogeneous packaging, quantifiable assurance, DoD unique needs, and enhanced U.S. microelectronics dominance.

FY 2019 funding in the amount of $291.000 million was added by Congress to support acceleration efforts for MINSEC, Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC), and strategic radiation-hardening activities.  In FY 2020, $302.000 million was added to accelerate activities for providing access and assurance to domestic SOTA and advanced packaging microelectronics production capabilities under Project 647.  FY 2020 funding in the amount of $5.000 million was added by Congress to support supply chain risk management (SCRM) efforts under Project 645.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project improves microelectronics test and verification methodologies in support of quantifying and verifying the trust and assurance of parts and develops standards and practices to foster commercial development of secure, trusted and assured parts.  Verification and test technologies are required to provide direct program support for microelectronics assurance verification.  Out-year demands will require an increase in capacity, which will take the form of additional personnel and/or equipment to permit scaling of microelectronics assessment capabilities.  Challenges have been identified, to include the ability to analyze leading-edge technology nodes (&lt;32 nanometers (nm)), throughput/time required for analysis, ability to analyze third-party intellectual property (IP) contained in microelectronic components, and analysis of non-application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) components that are increasingly being used for agility, e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This project addresses these gaps in current technical capabilities as required to meet the realized and projected out-year demand for core Trusted &amp; Assured Microelectronics laboratory services.  Three capability areas core to microelectronics analysis and verification will be improved:

• Physical verification, i.e., destructive analysis of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. 
• Functional analysis, i.e., non-destructive screening/verification of select, critical parts.
• Design verification, i.e., verification/assurance of designs, IP, netlists, bitstreams, firmware, etc.

These improvements address two primary attributes: (1) technical capability including laboratory equipment, IP, analysis tools, such as imaging software, and highly skilled tradecraft, and (2) the capacity to perform microelectronics assessments and quantify assurance.

This project develops and matures assurance mitigations, quantitatively evaluates the effectiveness of protections of IP in support of confidentiality and integrity, and develops and validates obfuscation and disaggregation technologies.  The project will address physical validation tool and capability development, design software validation tool development, counterfeit detection and imaging techniques, system vulnerability assessments, testbeds, and distributed data source availability to demonstrate and operationalize full lifecycle data driven quantifiable assurance.

This project also develops standards and practices in support of assured designs, supply chains and formal relationships with industry.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to develop the next generation, technology data-driven approach to microelectronics assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom, secure, and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of core Trusted &amp; Assured Microelectronics laboratories with regard to verification and validation of SOTA microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will develop, demonstrate, and implement quantitative and innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP, including alternatives for trusted and assured strategic radiation-hardened electronics in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technology development, and other assurance mitigations.  It will develop, demonstrate, and implement advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing, provenance and traceability, and independent verification and validation of commercial and specialized DoD designs.  It will also develop, demonstrate, and implement concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risk associated with sole-source suppliers and increase the Government’s ability to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of developed technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases in which the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies developed under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in secure environments.  The project would also support using a repository of vetted third-party IP and electronic data automation (EDA) tools to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.

This project initially received additional funding in FY 2019 to support Microelectronics Innovation for National Security and Economic Competitiveness (MINSEC) efforts in the following focus areas:  capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronics.  In FY 2019, funding for those MINSEC activities was reallocated from projects P-646 to P-647.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>This project will engage early on with potential stakeholders to identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.

Primary efforts will include the following:

• Reducing-to-practice technologies enabling assured (1) design, (2) access, (3) component integrity and (4) IP protection.
• Assured design demonstration and evaluation.
• Systems security analysis for assurance of microelectronics in DoD missions.
• Analog test chip fabrication.
• Advanced chip interconnection development to eliminate wire bonding and improve functional performance.
• Printed circuit board (PrCB) design confirmation tool development.
• Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) netlist analysis capability development.
• Field programmable gate array (FPGA) analyses tool development.
• Identification of non-invasive measurement techniques at the die/wafer level to provide increased hardware assurance.

Primary activities in FY 2019 will continue the development of these technologies, followed by transition of these capabilities to new programs in the fiscal years that follow under PE 0605294D8Z.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the DoD microelectronics strategy by ensuring the availability of and access to advanced, assured microelectronics that are critical for DoD and national security systems.  It will support the development and delivery of tools to protect the intellectual property (IP) confidentiality and integrity across the full microelectronics life cycle for a broad range of systems and missions and will provide a path for the production of these articles.  

It will allow DoD to:
1) provide multiple options for programs and the defense industrial base to rapidly modernize state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronic components; 
2) promote access to all needed current and future semiconductor technologies, including design, fabrication, packaging, and testing, from a robust base of commercially sustainable suppliers;  
3) maintain technological leadership and a secure domestic microelectronics ecosystem to  create a competitive industrial base of microelectronics suppliers that can rapidly adjust to the dynamics of the industry including the initiation of modernization pilots with DoD programs and industry to prototype and demonstrate new capabilities; and  
4) provide DoD’s captive specialty needs suppliers and dedicated facilities with cost-effective upgrade capabilities and resources so they can deliver advanced  technologies.

This project supports a broader national strategy to focus resources, policies, and incentives to enhance current and next generation defense capability by:
1) maintaining access to U.S. domestic production of SOTA technology;  
2) enhancing state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries in the U.S. to produce more advanced technologies to better serve low-volume customers in the aerospace and defense community; 
3) investing in research and development (R&amp;D) for the next generation of microelectronics for new materials, devices, architectures, and designs in coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI); 
4) promoting threat awareness, proactive protection, and supply chain security to ensure these investments continue to benefit the U.S.; 
5) exploring incentives for market growth through dual-use technologies, piloting acquisition reforms, partnering with industry, and providing incentives for cooperative R&amp;D and trade; and 
6) establishing innovation hub pilots with industry. 

MINSEC activities are categorized into the following focus areas:  access to specialized SOTA and dual use microelectronics technology, collection and analysis of data for metrics driven quantifiable assurance, maintaining and enhancing U.S capability though development, capture and secure, and transition of next generation microelectronics technology insertion; microelectronics-focused workforce development; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD); and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronic (OE) microelectronics. 

This project in FY 2020 funds the following focus areas: SOTA access through secure design, packaging, and enhanced foundry access; development and maturation of commercially viable quantifiable assurance technologies; capture and secure microelectronics R&amp;D; new microelectronics development and capability insertion; RHBP and RHBD; and RF and OE microelectronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>In 2021, this project incorporates portions of projects P291, P645 and P646.  It will continue Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) strategic partnerships and establish new strategic partnerships with existing commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) domestic foundries to develop a data-driven, risk-based approach to supply chain protection and develop the assured access, secure design, and manufacture of advanced microelectronics technology and electronic components.

This project will develop a new data driven quantifiable assurance paradigm for supply chain protection.  It will strengthen security while improving access, exposing no sensitive intellectual property (IP) to the foundry and requiring post-manufacture validation of foundry products. The enhancement will develop quantifiably assured design concepts in manufactured systems, enabling a formal risk-based approach to protection techniques. Manufactured microelectronics will be tested to ensure that IP protections meet or exceed current National Security Agency standards for IP protection, and to develop DoD’s ability to detect certain malicious supply chain attacks on DoD microelectronics. 

Successful implementation will transition these technologies to use in DoD programs, obtain access to multiple commercial microelectronics facilities, establish secure design capabilities, and solidify a data-driven approach to supply chain protection.  It also includes keeping pace with the rapid advancements in microelectronics technology and the globalization of this industry sector. It will provide the basics for updating and strengthening DoD assurance policy and includes collaborating with industry to develop data driven quantifiable standards.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

It will provide access to, personalization of, and customization for supporting DoD programs.  It will enable a revolutionary leap in system performance that will greatly reduce size, weight and power (SWaP) by incorporating the immense advances in SOTA commercial off the shelf (COTS) processing technologies, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microprocessors, and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs).

Planned activities transitioning from projects P-645, P-646 and P-647 as follows:
• Enhance secure design and packaging capability with new tools/techniques.
• Qualify advanced heterogeneous packaging technology.
• Continued development of secure, accessible, and cost effective SOTA heterogeneous integration design, assembly and test capability.  Establish a SOTA prototype packaging secure assembly and test source for SOTA digital and RF applications.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project addresses the dual problems of commanding only a small market share while requiring an expansive range of unique microelectronics needs, from boutique and legacy components to state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies.  The Government must sustain specialty suppliers, given their criticality to national security.  In particular, DoD needs access to a diverse microelectronics ecosystem to develop and acquire the application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and personalized commercial off the shelf (COTS) components required for military radiation hardened and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronic (OE) needs.  

The Department frequently relies on commercial suppliers to optimize performance and reduce costs for sophisticated weapon system and secure network functionality.  It is critical to have DoD reliability access to subject matter expertise, technology, and manufacturing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>DoD will partner with the intelligence community, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop radiation hardened components that permit systems to operate in space and other harsh environments. state-of-the-practice (SOTP) and state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies will be characterized and developed in support of Radiation Hardened By Process (RHBP) and Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) activities in support DoD modernization programs with radiation hardened requirements.   A similar situation exists for radio frequency and optical applications.  These two applications reflect only a small market with unique costs and specifications, which does not inherently create incentive for industrial investment.

Planned activities transitioning from projects P-645, P-646 and P-647 as follows:

• Establish assurance foundations for radio frequency (RF) designs.
• Establish foundations of assurance for RF applications; deliverables include expansion into other discipline areas: RF, optoelectronic (OE), and Additive Manufacturing.
• Continue to qualify sources for radiation hardened (RH) electronics to transition developed radiation hardened capabilities. 
• Finalize qualification of additional strategic RH sources; qualify RH memories and system on chip; demonstrate up to TRL 7 of strategic Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) in at least 3 SOTA technology nodes; confirm additional sources for digital Radiation Hardened By Process (RHBP) capability.
• Deliverables: Demonstrate strategic RHBD in at least 2 SOTA technologies with validated PDKs.
• Major Milestone:  Establish 2nd source for strategic RHBP state-of-the-practice (SOTP) partially depleted silicon on insulator source in support of nuclear modernization.
• Qualify new, SOTP and SOTA, sources (foundry process) for radiation hardened microelectronics.
• Develop and enhance DoD Lab test and evaluation infrastructure required for verification and validation of radiation hardened microelectronics, technology characterization, and device modeling and simulation.
• Provide coordination and subject matter expertise in support of the Strategic Radiation Hardened Electronics Council (SRHEC) for the identification of technology gaps, technology roadmap development, and inform future investments.
• Develop and demonstrate RF and OE microelectronics using secured design environments, advanced non-complementary metal oxide semiconductor substrates, and optimized SOTA intellectual property (IP) and test articles for next generation advanced sensors and communications.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Microelectronics are critical technologies that drive the modern economy and enable the defense systems that allow warfighters to accomplish their missions.  Other nations recognize the need to control the microelectronics supply chain and indigenous state-of-the-art (SOTA) manufacturing.  Aggressive investments and licit and illicit actions by peer nations threaten U.S. leadership.  China alone purports investment of $150 billion and a national strategy to achieve dominance in all major areas of microelectronics by 2030.  Russia and China have publicly stated that advanced microelectronics, AI, and machine learning (ML) are the keys to economic and military dominance.

This project will promote microelectronics innovation and create resilient and robust Microelectronics pipeline including supplier chain, next generation technology and workforce. It will slow and in the long-term reverse offshoring trends by fostering commercial and Government alliances to preserve the U.S. ecosystem, lower barriers to innovation and adoption, strengthen workforce expertise, lead the next generation of advanced technology, and maintain the United States as the global source for high-end, secure, and reliable microelectronics components.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Significant increases in assurance and protection of DoD technical data and components will be achieved through improvements in design practices, modern commercial security practices, and advanced packaging and chain of custody technologies.  

This activity, along with continued engagements and partnerships with industry will foster necessary security features in commercial products and infrastructure that will facilitate long-term assured access for the U.S. Government to commercial advanced SOTA technology providers.

Planned activities transitioning from projects P-645, P-646 and P-647 as follows:
• Align stakeholder prototype demonstrators using assurance enabled SOTA fabrication.
• Prototype modernization of existing systems with state of the art fabrication technologies with enhanced assurance techniques.
• Continue established industry partnerships for assured technology co-development and prototype development.  Perform modernization prototype demonstrations with DoD acquisition programs.
• Demonstrate limited defensive measures for the protection of commercial wireless systems; 
• Initiate development of a tactical radio prototype, leveraging commercial and DoD-developed hardware and software;
• Formalize a sustainable manufacturing model for leading-edge DoD application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), following the demonstration of commercially-manufactured academic and DoD designs; [Domestic Foundries]
• Demonstrate rapid transition of DoD-relevant field programmable gate array-based capabilities to structured ASICs, with security capabilities to protect DoD intellectual property (IP) during manufacture;  
• Demonstrate advanced negative capacitance non-volatile memory devices, supporting the growing energy-efficient computational needs for many DoD applications.
• Establish expertise, and build close connections within the U.S. Semiconductor industry to report on and mitigate supply chain threats.
• Development of tools to trace parts through their supply chain and track the health of the U.S. semiconductor segments.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>In partnership with the Services and Defense Agencies, the Rapid Prototyping Program (RPP) encourages joint Service development through prototyping efforts that reduce risk, establish affordable and realistic requirements, and support timely development of fieldable capabilities demonstrated in an operational environment.  RPP addresses priorities identified by the National Defense Strategy, the Department of Defense (DoD) modernization priorities, the Chairman’s Capability Gap Assessment, and Service or Agency identified capability gaps and needs.  Service and Agency senior executives participate in the project selection process to reduce duplication, synchronize prototyping efforts, and target projects with the widest benefit to the Joint Service.  Overarching program goals include enhanced warfighter lethality, modernization of cross-cutting technology areas, and delivering capabilities more quickly than traditional acquisition.

RPP develops prototypes that reduce technical and integration risk to define and improve requirements for programs of record.  RPP project selection aligns to DoD modernization priorities including autonomous systems; hypersonics; fully networked command, control, and communications; electronic warfare; sensors for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and fire control.  RPP rapidly develops and fields cross-cutting, prototype capabilities that demonstrate in an operational environment to inform the DoD and Service leadership.  Individual projects generally receive one year of funding, typically at a cost of less than $10.000 million.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was established in April 2015 and DIUx 2.0 in May 2016. Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) was transferred from OSD (PE 0602230D8Z) to Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) (PE 0603342D8W).  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.  Effective FY 2020, DIU funding transferred from WHS to OSD consistent with the realignment and establishment of USD(Research &amp; Engineering), and disestablishment of USD(Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DIU mission is to accelerate innovation in the commercially-focused technology sector to the warfighter.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy asserts that we have returned to an era of inter-state strategic competition with Russia and China, heightening the sense of urgency with which the nation, and Department of Defense (DoD) in particular, must reform our acquisition policies and approach to sustaining military-technical superiority. Adversaries are challenging the U.S. across several dimensions.  Most importantly, adversaries are at par or ahead of the U.S. in critical technology areas.  Consistent with the FY 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB)/Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) research and development budget priorities, this new era of competition requires technological superiority to ensure ability to project power, maintain international norms and rule of law, and to serve as a credible deterrence.  Notably, the critical technologies that forge military-technical superiority are increasingly dual-use and rapidly developed by the commercial sector.

The U.S. DoD relies on innovation to maintain our nation's ability to deter, and if need be, prevail in conflict. DIU increases the Department's access to leading-edge technologies and talent that reside in the commercial sector, with the ultimate goal of accelerating innovation into the hands of the warfighter. Working across the country, and in collaboration with allied international partners, DIU is developing new ways of doing business, growing our defense industrial base to include "non-traditional" companies that had previously not collaborated with the military, working with traditional vendors in novel ways to increase efficiency, and challenging innovators to share their knowledge and expertise in support of our nation's defense.

The DIU Prototyping program will find and provide access to technology companies on behalf of DoD organizations.  Additionally, DIU will execute projects to leverage commercial sector technology analogous to military application thereby increasing dual-use technology agility for the DoD.  DIU Prototyping funds will facilitate the award of projects that can augment commercial technologies, existing government-owned capabilities or concepts for defense application.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>This was a new Program Element in FY 2020 with two Project Codes for DIU Prototyping/Project 843, $17.000 million, and National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC)/Project 844, $75.000 million.  For Project 843, FY 2020 $17.000 million was transferred from WHS O&amp;M 0901583D8W to RDT&amp;E, DW PE 0604341D8Z/843 DIU Prototyping.  Project 844 NSIC was a new program add in FY2020, but was not funded due to a Congressional mark. NSIC was to fund the commercialization and scaling dual-use, hardware-based technologies that are critical to the military. These technology areas are currently severely underserved by the private U.S. venture capital industry and often funded by strategic and persistent capital from China. NSIC would attract private capital to leverage DoD investments in select priority projects that include batteries, drones, and quantum sensors.

The overall decrease in FY 2021 of $3.732 million was a planned program change.  The DIU Prototyping focus areas will not only save funds in the future, but more importantly, grow the National Security Innovation Base (NSIB) by attracting new NSIB suppliers and improve the adoption of commercial technologies for the warfighter.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

Initially, DIUx was managed by the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&amp;L)) when it was established in July 2015.  In May 2016, DIUx was placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense and administratively managed by WHS.  In July 2018, DIUx was realigned from WHS to the OUSD(R&amp;E).  In August 2018, DIUx was re-designated the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to signify a permanence of the program.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Department of Defense (DoD) Unmanned Systems (UxS) Common Development program is a joint effort to develop and demonstrate common standards, architectures, and technologies that address unmanned systems’ issues across all domains and all Military Services.  The intent is to increase interoperability and effectiveness by promoting cooperative development of solutions that are applicable across all unmanned systems.  This effort initially focused on addressing DoD unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), to include integration into the National Airspace System (NAS) and a common, interoperable ground station architecture and associated interface standards. While UAS initially was the primary focus, interoperability among all unmanned and manned systems is the long-term goal.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The focus is on safe and secure integration into the National Airspace, which includes GBSAA, ABSAA, and Unmanned Traffic Management interoperability and standards.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Global Hawk and Triton, as well as other Group 3-5 UAS, need a sense-and-avoid (SAA) capability as an alternate means of compliance to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.111 and Part 91.113, requirement to see and avoid other aircraft.  The Air Force is leading the effort to develop an ABSAA system that is suitable to support operations within U.S. and foreign airspace. The RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, MQ-1B Predator, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, and MQ-9 Reaper all have a requirement for SAA capability and will leverage the technology being developed by the Air Force. The Army is leading the development of a GBSAA system to provide a solution for improved airspace access in terminal operations as well as operations/training within the GBSAA system's coverage area (e.g., Gray Eagle at Fort Hood and Shadow operations at Cherry Point). This system provides a near-term solution and is an integral part of the long-term permanent solution. Long-term GBSAA systems and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) architectures, operating concepts, standards and technology are being developed to allow DoD, commercial, and private manned and Group 1-5 Unmanned Aircraft to operate safely and effectively in the national airspace.  The change in airspace procedures, airspace de-confliction, and Traffic Management requires new processes and procedures for safe and secure national airspace access.  
 
This joint funding also supports development of common operating concepts, policy, standards, modeling and simulation, and technology to enable DoD UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Starting in FY 2010, the Department's sense and avoid (SAA) developmental efforts are enhanced by this defense-wide program element. This program has provided joint funding to accelerate the development of SAA technology and standards to enable UAS to routinely access the national and international airspace systems.  This program also supports development of UAS airspace integration policy and standards as well as the modeling, simulation, and operational analysis needed to validate the standards.  In FY 2013, ABSAA and GBSAA efforts transitioned to the Services.

FY 2019 Accomplishments:
Completed Final Operational Capability at Grand Forks and Bealle AFB.
Integrated GBSAA at Fargo and March AFB.
Completed full testing of UTM Architecture and DoD unmanned Service Supplier System interfaces in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.
Conducted Integration of UTM into DoD Counter UAS Systems.
Completed study and formally requested a Remote Identification Rule to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The JAIC was established to preserve and expand our military advantage in support of the Department’s 2018 National Defense Strategy. As a primarily executing body it will accelerate the delivery of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled capabilities, scale the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize DoD AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages.  The JAIC mission is to accelerate the delivery of AI to achieve impact scaled across the DoD at relevant speed to transform the DoD and ensure the nation maintains a competitive advantage.  JAIC capitalizes on Project Maven’s efforts as the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD to further critical AI architecture and prototyping to rapidly expand AI to other mission areas. As JAIC efforts prove relevant, they will expedite technology transition from the laboratory to operational use, and increase Joint Force capability.  Most military data storage, utilization, and analytic tools and systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. The JAIC will adopt or adapt commercial and government developed capabilities to improve warfighting and business processes. 

JAIC will execute an initial sequence of AI implementations, called National Mission Initiatives (NMI), to demonstrate value and create momentum. NMIs are high-priority, pressing operational or business reform challenges. Additionally, JAIC will work closely with individual components to help identify, shape, and accelerate component-specific AI deployments, called Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). Both NMI and CMI efforts will include government, commercial, and academic partners to prototype and develop standardized processes with respect to data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial projects to establish new processes and standards that will be repeatable across additional projects and immediately relevant to the Joint Force. This will be done in collaboration with partners across technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), services, and international partners.

JAIC will scale use cases throughout the DoD in a manner that aligns with and leverages DoD enterprise cloud computing. It will establish a common foundation for scaling AI’s impact across DoD, including shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, and cloud and edge services. This will drive greater value by enabling consistency of approach, technology, and tools for all delivery-focused AI projects.
JAIC will foster shared lessons, and establish an enterprise approach while catalyzing efforts across DoD to enable more rapid and efficient prototyping and delivery of AI capabilities. JAIC will develop a governance framework and standards for AI development and delivery and collaborate within DoD, across government, and with industry, academia, and U.S. allies to strengthen partnerships, highlight critical needs, solve problems of urgent operational significance, and adapt AI technologies for DoD missions.

JAIC develops, tests, prototypes and demonstrates innovative AI, Machine Learning (ML), data infrastructure, and model/algorithm test and assessment capabilities to integrate AI capabilities across numerous domains and technical areas including maintenance and supply chain, personnel recovery, infrastructure assessment, geospatial monitoring during disaster, and cyber sense making. JAIC develops and evaluates integrated prototype technologies in realistic operating environments with DoD entities to assess the performance or cost reduction potential of applying such advanced technology to scale across multiple services.  JAIC does this by aligning rapid prototype projects under NMIs and leverages existing commercial technology for DoD use, built upon a common architecture that enables the DoD to rapidly scale AI capability.  

For the Predictive Maintenance NMI, JAIC uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics to forecast major issues on the H-60 helicopter platform to better enable services to respond to upcoming failure. AI/ML will help identify component failure relationships to principle end items to predict critical failure prior to corrective maintenance and reactive supply chain requisitions. This will increase efficiency, decrease fleet operating and sustainment costs for equipment platforms, and reduce the time and costs associated with repair part requisition, management and transportation. Predictive maintenance will increase fleet operational readiness through reduced deadline or degradation time, particularly by preventing critical failure during missions, thereby providing certainty for availability and tasking to combatant commands and Joint Forces. This NMI will also apply AI and ML to optimize positioning of tools, parts, and personnel to provide the Joint Force with the best location to provide efficient and cost-effective repair and supply depots.

For the Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief NMI, JAIC will use computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and identify distressed or missing personnel, predict forest fire patterns and burn rates, and flooding that impact human life and infrastructure. JAIC does this within FMV images (e.g., person, forest fire lines, flood lines, terrain and infrastructure changes) and other AI algorithms for text based projects to coordinate disaster relief efforts. JAIC algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from multiple intelligence sources.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 4, Demonstration and Validation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                    <r2:Text>JAIC used rapid prototype sprints to field increasing predictive maintenance capability for the H-60 helicopter fleet across the Joint Force. JAIC used data aggregation, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive analytics algorithms to detect, correlate, and predict component failure and optimize supply chain solutions. This initiative brought artificial intelligence, deep learning, and predictive algorithms into the maintenance and supply business processes of H-60 fleet management, utilizing Joint Force readiness and supply data to process at machine speed versus human speed. 

JAIC also used rapid prototype sprints to field capability to the Joint Force that enabled better response to natural disasters, particularly those caused by wildfires and flooding, both common worldwide. Computer vision and algorithms not only reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data, but provide insights and capability that humans alone currently do not have the capacity to manage. JAIC developed algorithms focused on ISR and geospatial data to develop baseline GEOINT and infrastructure, then analyzed changes to that baseline to best provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. This aided in the more efficient, effective, and quick recovery of distressed humans, identified damage to infrastructure, and assisted relief efforts or evacuation and aid response. Overall, this effort reduced risk to human life, critical infrastructure, and improved U.S. response in times of regional or global crises. This effort integrated AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for predictive algorithms, computer vision to identify critical information requirements, and user alerts.

The JAIC created a Joint Common Foundation (JCF) platform that was crucial to the development, testing, and fielding of AI capabilities to the Department. This JCF contained shared common components providing NMIs/CMIs and the Department with the packages, frameworks, software, tools necessary to accelerate the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities. This included the build out of AI platforms in a secure protected enclave hosted in a multi-cloud/multi-domain environment which provides NMIs/CMIs with compute, storage and security.
The JCF platform supported scalable delivery of novel, impactful AI capability across DoD through the use of several key infrastructure elements. This infrastructure/environment supported each stage of the applied AI lifecycle, including: prototyping, integration, scaling, and support. The common foundation includes shared data, reusable tools, frameworks and standards, in addition to cloud and edge services.  As the JAIC scaled and the common foundation developed, entities across DOD were be able to both use and contribute to the infrastructure, leveraging the “factory” of artifacts. This was done in collaboration with industry and government partners, including technology companies, consulting firms, academia, government labs, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), and across the Department.

The JCF platform promoted information sharing and integration with Programs of Record by facilitating rapid deployment of AI capabilities into operational environments, military platforms and IT systems.  JAIC established its Tier 2 (Mission/Business Processes) and Tier 3 (IS and PIT Systems)  RMF governance structure to comply with DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT) and DoDI 8500.01,  Cybersecurity.</r2:Text>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE) by funding activities that help CAPE to implement warfighting analysis in support of the National Defense Strategy.  CAPE accomplishes this by leading studies to support campaign analysis and analytical research across a spectrum of national security issues and concerns.  

These RDT&amp;E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  
The research agenda focuses on near- to long-term problems identified by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting environments and scenarios.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments to inform OPLAN development and DoD's approach to concept development, evaluation, and force development.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE). It funds activities that help CAPE to implement the vision of the
Deputy Secretary of Defense to support new approaches to campaign analysis. CAPE will accomplish this by leading studies and developing analytic tools to
think about future capabilities and posture.

This program provides for analytical research across a spectrum of issues and concerns. The research agenda is focused on near to long-term problems identified by
the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to
enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of
current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess scenarios and concepts of operations (CONOPS) for a wide range of warfighting
environments and scenarios. Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate findings and assessments. Outcomes
include the compilation and campaign analyses data to support the DOD capabilities to the challenges of a near-peer warfight.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Rapid Innovation Program (RIP) was established in Section 1073 of the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and authorized as a permanent program in the FY 2017 NDAA.  Section 224 of the FY 2019 NDAA codified the RIP in the U.S. Code as Title 10, Section 2359a (TAB B).  The RIP accelerates the fielding of innovative technologies into military systems via a competitive, merit-based selection process.  Technology innovations are drawn from Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) projects, defense laboratory and academia efforts, and other innovative technologies, including dual-use and Independent Research &amp; Development (IRAD) technologies.  Projects stimulate innovation, mitigate technical risks, reduce acquisition and/or lifecycle costs, improve test outcomes, and rapidly insert technology into major acquisition programs and other programs that meet critical national security needs.  RIP provides a mechanism for bridging the “Valley of Death” by funding the integration work vital to transition technologies out of the laboratory and into Programs of Record.  Since inception, RIP has evaluated over 20,000 industry submitted white papers by companies from all 50 states and funded over 900 projects across 26 different organizations in the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and other Defense Agencies.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>From FY 2011 thru FY 2019, the RIP has been funded through Congressional Adds.

RIP funds are distributed among the Services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and the other Defense agencies.  RIP is executed via a competitive two-step process for participation in the program.  Industry participants are invited to submit a three-page white paper plus a quad chart through an annual Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Once white papers are reviewed, the highest ranking white papers are invited to submit full detailed proposals for funding consideration.  In ranking white papers, preference is given to projects focusing on the Research and Engineering top 10 research priorities, the National Defense Strategy, and small businesses.  Full proposals are subject to final review and the highest ranking proposals are selected for contract award.  The statute for RIP defines project scope as not to exceed 24 months and $3.000 million per project.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Successful RIP projects can transition to acquisition via several ways including, but not limited to:  
1) technology upgrade insertion into a current platform or program providing greater capability, reduced lifecycle costs, or prolonging the life of the weapon system; 2) informing/refining future requirements providing better outcomes for planned systems; or 3) a direct transition/procurement should the item/article provide a new capability.

E. Performance Metrics
Each RIP project is evaluated at its conclusion based on two measures: 1) technical performance, or extent the RIP project is meeting its technical goals, with an assessment of cost, schedule, and deliverables against stated objectives; and 2) transition status, or the extent to which an acquisition program or customer has been identified and is participating in procuring the technology, assuming the RIP project is successful.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) addresses the need to defend and deter against weapons of mass destruction threats and to safeguard personnel; prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard the foregoing against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.  This program oversees advanced engineering development and rapid fielding throughout the DoD for an integrated and systemic approach for countering nuclear threats and the development of nuclear and conventional physical security material solutions.  Public Law, Presidential and DoD-level guidance, and Combatant Command and Service requirements drive the priorities for these programs.

Under this PE, funding associated with nuclear and convention physical security material solution for the Department is broken down into seven capability areas: (1) Detection and Assessment; (2) Access Controls; (3) Installation and Transport Security; (4) Storage and Safeguards; (5) Prevention; (6) Decision Support Systems; and (7) Analytical Support.  The material solutions either (a) lead to a Programs of Record transitioning to Program Element 0604161D8Z for Systems Development and Demonstration; (b) become technology insertions into existing programs; or (c) advance to being a certified Commercial/Government off-the-shelf product.  The Physical Security Enterprise and Analysis Group is responsible for avoiding duplication of effort, ensuring systems integration, and promoting interoperability and sustainability.

This PE can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including staffing, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research, development, and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ability to detect an adversary and assess their intentions is a basic physical security tenant.  This capability area will design equipment to identify and warn of unauthorized access to a specified area or installation as well as equipment related to the notification and identification of explosive threats or hazards.

Accomplishment: The PSEAP and the National Nuclear Security Administration are jointly developing a Portable Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) that addresses similar needs to protect nuclear weapons and special nuclear material. PIDS will provide a stable sensor platform that maintains the integrity of an existing secure perimeter in the event of sensor maintenance or system downtime. These include, but are not limited to, scheduled maintenance and upgrade activities for extended periods of time, or during emergency situations requiring the establishment of a National Defense Area; and mission requirements that dictate deployment of nuclear certified assets to locations that do not meet nuclear security requirements.</r2:Description>

This capability area will focus on programs and processes related to the validity and verification of individuals entering or already within, a facility.

Accomplishment: Defense Installation Access Control project enhances the Identity Matching Engine for Security &amp; Analysis used at hundreds of DoD entry control points to compare Personal Identity Verification/Common Access Card holders against the National Crime Information Center and the Interstate Identification Index. Previous work developed a capability that compares DoD registered cardholders against the FBI’s Wanted Persons File and against the Terrorist Screening Database. This capability prevents un-cleared people or potential terrorists from entering DoD installations. The updated system identified an individual with warrants for murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon trying to get installation access.</r2:Description>

The investments will significantly increase thermal protection system industrial capacity, essential for economic production of glide bodies in operationally significant quantities.  These funds also contributed to industry contracts to realize affordability and production improvements in hypersonic glide bodies, allowing for cost-effective production of more capable systems.  The funds were also leveraged to establish an early land-based operational hypersonic capability in the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), with contracts initiated for long-lead procurement of mobile transporter/erector/launcher (TEL), Command/Control equipment, and LRHW all-up round plus canister elements.  Similarly, the funds have been utilized to establish an early sea-based Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike capability, with both surface and sub-surface capability planned.  In addition, funding has been invested in the creation of a Mach 10 Quiet Wind Tunnel at the University of Notre Dame, a necessary investment to facilitate future hypersonic research.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>This effort will test and evaluate alternative booster and delivery vehicle options and will assess the feasibility of producing an affordable solution to fill the Prompt Global Strike capability gap.  It will mature technologies that could lead to advanced systems with the following characteristics: effects on targets in a very short-period of time from execution order; non-ballistic flight over the majority of the flight path; positive control from launch to impact; adequate cross-range/maneuverability to avoid overflight issues; and controlled stage drop over Broad Ocean Area.  The technologies developed will have cross-Service and cross-concept applicability and will be developed through close coordination among DoD components.  This activity will support both ground and flight tests and provide all national data to inform a potential acquisition program.

FY 2019 funding designed, procured, and produced all necessary materials to conduct and execute the Flight Experiment 2 (FE-2) on schedule.  FE-2 is the highest priority test element in the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) portfolio, with systems integration, production, and test data directly contributing to fielding an early operational capability.  In addition, FY 2019 funds were expended preparing for Flight Test 3 (FT-3) and Flight Experiment 3 (FE-3), enhancing the pace of test launches, and serving to refine booster and glide body data immediately prior to operational production and fielding.  FY 2019 funds were also invested to research and mature technologies critical to fielding effective hypersonic weapon systems.  These include: ordnance research (fuzing, effects and lethality); navigation, guidance, and control research to address operation in contested environments; test and evaluation research to improve the capabilities of broad ocean area test ranges; mission planning research; and structures and aerothermodynamics research.

Funding reprogrammed into this PE was leveraged to support development, systems engineering, program management, test execution and planning for the Army Long Range Hypersonic Weapon system.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides resources for developmental acquisition support and portfolio management in support of three primary Goals in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Strategy
1) Trained and Equipped Cyber Mission Force
2) Cyber Hardened Weapon Systems and Critical Infrastructure
3) Enhanced Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Cyber Security

The Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&amp;S)) conducts mission engineering for cyberspace operations to inform and support the development of Joint Cyber capabilities as the Department conceives, develops, and rapidly fields cyber capabilities for Cyberspace Operations. The newly established OUSD(A&amp;S) Chief Information Security Office (CISO) was created to improve planning, coordination, synchronization, and integration of cyber activities and increase DoD wide emphasis on reducing the cyber risk to critical DoD missions and enhancing DIB Cyber Security.

Funds provide technical, systems engineering, trend analysis, and portfolio management of programs, projects, and activities developing cyber capabilities to maximize the Department's return on investment of cyberspace resources and effect a comprehensive approach for assessing, procuring, and sustaining critical cyber capabilities and cyber resilient systems and platforms from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of weapons systems performance and military
operations.

Additionally, these funds will provide systems analyses, portfolio management, and executive support of Senior Cyber Leadership forums, enterprise wide systems engineering and operational impact analyses related to Cyber capabilities, enhancing cyber resilience within systems and platforms, and enhancing the cybersecurity of the DIB.

Resources will also be used to provide expertise required for exercising technical direction over design, performance, cost parameters, and determining and mitigating cyber risks of key systems and their dependencies. The goal of this funding is to assure capability advantage, reduce time to the field, evaluate projects and concepts, minimize cyber related performance and operational risk of developing and fielding complex systems, ensure program dependencies are documented and included in acquisition decisions, and address cyber security requirements, gaps, and required technical solutions.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The funding request for the Defense Exportability Features (DEF) Program for FY 2020 - 2025 reflects new, higher demand for funds as the Department of Defense (DoD) increasingly makes integration of exportability features a standard part of the DoD’s requirements development and defense acquisition system.  As reflected in the new guidance in the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 025-19 signed by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS) on April 15, 2019, DoD will update the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual to make it standard practice to include the requirements for exportability in a system's capability requirements documents</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The DEF program funds activities to support identification of major defense acquisition programs for possible export and the planning for design and incorporation of exportability features during the research and development phases of these programs.  Features include, but are not limited to, technology and engineering design activities such as capability differentials, anti-tamper, system assurance, and software assurance.  Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities.

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

Experience has shown that failure to identify the full range of Critical Program Information (CPI) early in a DoD program's design phase can drive major affordability and schedule problems later when programs have to "retrofit" program protection measures prior to export.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends and may enhance US industry share of the global
marketplace.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Activities include the development of program protection strategies for the program; the design and incorporation of exportability features into the system; implementation of exportability requirements into contracts; and other research, development, test, and evaluation activities.

Defense exportability features play a critically important role in DoD efforts to build partnership capacity.  Funds support building joint and coalition environments by enabling the export of DoD systems to a wide range of partner nations, resulting in improved security and interoperability.  In addition to the operational benefits, by providing these resources up front, the United States and partner nations will save significant resources by more efficiently designing and producing exportable U.S. systems. 

Failure to consider export variant designs early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delayed delivery, and higher risk of sensitive technology compromise.  Early development of export variants, including systems design approaches to integrate exportable anti-tamper protection and differential capability requirements to lower production costs, makes it possible to improve quality and timely deliveries to allies and friends and may enhance US industry share of the global marketplace.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Failure to assess DEF considerations early in the acquisition process results in increased costs, delays in delivery, and higher risk of critical technology compromise.  Funding decreases in FY 2019 compared to subsequent fiscal years, however, the Program anticipates supporting some of the Department's most important modernization efforts such as the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) and Future Vertical Lift (FVL) programs, and the DEF Program has greater need from participating programs than there are available funds to disburse for FY2019.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>As the Department of Defense strategic, operational, and tactical plans and objectives transform the war fighter with new capabilities and doctrine, the budgeting and accountability of funds used to pursue the Department objectives will become more complicated and detailed for senior leaders to make decisions with supporting rationale for the taxpayer.  Incorporating information technology toward current and emerging business processes manifesting into a state-of-the art system of systems will result in increasing efficiencies, timely diagnostics, and reducing lifecycle costs to maintain, sustain and repair.

This initiative exploits emerging technology, processes, trends, capabilities, and techniques to incorporate state-of-the-art information technology enabling the ability, agility, and level of fidelity to collect, process, administrate and report resource management data and to automate business processes within a more robust analytical environment within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) OUSD(C).
  
NEXT GENERATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) is responsible for advising the Secretary of Defense on all Defense budgetary and fiscal matters, for Defense budget development and execution, and for overseeing financial management across the Department. The OUSD(C) has a broad set of responsibilities in supporting the Planning, Programing, Budget and Execution (PPBE) process. The Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), provides independent analytic advice to the Secretary of Defense on all aspects of the Defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of program and defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems.  There is a critical need for the development of a state-of-the-art information technology system to modernize and replace multiple, antiquated legacy systems and processes used to formulate, justify, present and defend the entire Department of Defense Budget in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller (OUSD(C)) to meet Title 10 and Title 31 mission and reporting requirements. The Comptroller’s plan for mitigating the deficiencies and capability gaps associated with current systems is development of the Next Generation Resource Management System.

OUSD(C) and CAPE use multiple systems to formulate, justify, distribute, and execute DoD budgets. The information managed by the budget formulation and programming systems is redundant, and reconciliation of information is difficult and inefficient. These systems require extensive manpower investments to give executives the information they need to make key financial decisions in a timely manner.

The OUSD(C) and CAPE require a more efficient, effective Defense budget environment that optimizes the budget cycle to ensure users are processing and reporting efficiently and DoD Senior Leadership has the information to make informed, critical decisions.

The OUSD(C) requires capabilities that shall provide for the effective formulation, and justification of the Defense budget. The requirement is for:
• Automated exchange and reconciliation of budget data
• Improved efficiency through the utilization of a unified budgetary model
• Instantaneous ability to generate data for management reviews and decisions
• Capability to accommodate emerging business practices

Moving forward, the new “to be” system shall be designed as a single system with a unified data source for OUSD(C) and CAPE. The new system shall provide a single, integrated system that employs the latest technologies to fulfill the Department’s financial management responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The new system shall provide twenty-first century information technology that shall allow users to view information from multiple fully integrated modules simultaneously, e.g., current year budget submission, decision documents from previous years, and budget execution information.

DEFENSE REPOSITORY FOR COMMON ENTERPRISE DATA:

Defense Repository for Common Enterprise data (Advana) support financial audit, cost management, performance management, and readiness.

The DoD Advana requires:
• All supporting Department data that rolls up to the DoD financial statement (detailed accounting data reconciled to the financial statement)
• Proof of the completeness of all transactional data reported within the UoT (detailed accounting data reconciled to business events)
• Ability to extract subset populations
• Ability to secure and protect the data within the UoT

The failure to meet these requirements will result in the Department unable to successfully conduct and pass an audit.

To achieve these requirements, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is creating a tool called the Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana). This tool has the potential to significantly improve DoD’s capability and capacity to handle large volumes of standard and non-standard business and readiness data. Both an application and analytical platform, the Advana leverages an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications to deliver a complete Advana.

The first phase of Advana implementation is a proof of concept with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) systems to develop a baseline application and configuration. When the first phase has been successfully completed, the second phase will integrate into the full solution any remaining accounting and business feeder systems that execute TI-97 funds and be the solution for DATA Act.

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Realignment of $1.5M to PE:  0903388D8Z</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)) is responsible for advising the Secretary of Defense on all Defense budgetary and fiscal matters, for Defense budget development and execution, and for overseeing financial management across the Department. The OUSD(C) has a broad set of responsibilities in supporting the Planning, Programing, Budget and Execution (PPBE) process. The Office of the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), provides independent analytic advice to the Secretary of Defense on all aspects of the Defense program, including alternative weapon systems and force structures, the development and evaluation of programs and defense program alternatives, and the cost-effectiveness of defense systems. 

OUSD(C) and CAPE use multiple systems to formulate, justify, distribute, and execute DoD budgets. The information managed by the budget formulation and programming systems is redundant, and reconciliation of information is difficult and inefficient. These systems require extensive manpower investments to give executives the information they need to make key financial decisions in a timely manner.

The OUSD(C) and CAPE require a more efficient, effective Defense budget environment that optimizes the budget cycle to ensure users are processing and reporting efficiently and DoD Senior Leadership has the information to make informed, critical decisions. 

The OUSD(C) requires capabilities that shall provide for the effective formulation, and justification of the Defense budget. The requirement is for:
• Automated exchange and reconciliation of budget data
• Improved efficiency through the utilization of a unified budgetary model
• Instantaneous ability to generate data for management reviews and decisions
• Capability to accommodate emerging business practices

Moving forward, the new “to be” system shall be designed as a single system with a unified data source for OUSD(C) and CAPE. The new system shall provide a single, integrated system that employs the latest technologies to fulfill the Department’s financial management responsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. The new system shall provide twenty-first century information technology that shall allow users to view information from multiple fully integrated modules simultaneously, e.g., current year budget submission, decision documents from previous years, and budget execution information.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>+$6.038 million is required to support Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Without a single Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana) to support the TI97 General Fund for the 4th Estate the Department will be incapable of asserting readiness for an independent audit of the
consolidated financial statements. All DoD organizations are pursuing the current statutory goal of achieving the state of audit that supports entry into a full financial
statement of audit in FY 2018 with an initial opinion rendered in mid-FY 2019. Without an automated capability to provide a transactional universe for sampling and
evidentiary proof the department will not be in compliance with public law.

The requested funds will be used to buy “Big Data” software and hardware infrastructure and required contractor services to implement the technology to meet the UoT
requirement.  These funds also include subject matter expertise costs for DCFO and funds to be placed on a contract for hardware, software, and labor. This will not result in hiring additional government personnel.

The Defense Repository for Common Enterprise Data (Advana) will have the capability to:
• Ingest data from multiple accounting and financial feeder systems
• Normalize data from multiple sources providing a common data architecture
• Reconcile transactional details to summary financial data
• Provide auditor’s the ability to sample TI-97 detailed transactions
• Business Analytics/Reporting
• DATA Act which is a statutory requirement to be completed by May 2017
• Provide NIPR and SIPR capability for non-sensitive and sensitive data

This effort will expand in scope to support other enterprise analytics efforts like cost management, performance management, and readiness. The scope is to bring in
data from an estimated 50 systems and demonstrate existence and completeness of business and accounting transaction data, which are capabilities required for audit
readiness and other analytical use cases.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Remarks>* Partial completion of this performance metric is primarily the result of challenges in meeting the DoD’s Cybersecurity Risk management Framework requirements necessary to transition capabilities from our contractor development site to an accredited DoD computing environment.  The discover functionality is operating in the contractor’s development environment but will require final hosting within a secure DoD computing environment to complete discovery capabilities via web services.

                                        <r2:Text>FY 2020 plans focus on addressing audit findings resulting from the DoD financial audit.  Specifically, improvements are needed to strengthen Government Furnished Property management (an identified material weakness) of property loss while in the hands of contractors as well as to implement data exchange standards across the finance and procurement community.  DoD must also implement across enterprise-wide systems the new data standard replacing the Dun and Bradstreet identifier.  The new data element is the Unique Entity Identifier that will impact every finance, logistics, and procurement system across DoD.  Additionally, an enterprise-wide searchable Commercial Item Determination repository will be established as directed in the NDAA. Initial steps will be taken to define a data standard for a Commercial Catalog critical to underpinning DoD’s ability to track prices of commercial items as well as capture item provenance as required in statute. The ability to enhance supply chain risk data mining will continue and the use of robotics will be explored. Issues identified with existing capability for contract closeout, contract clause execution, Contracting Officer Representatives and Purchase Card officials, Procurement Administrative Lead Time and DoD organization hierarchy will continue as operational implementation matures.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) supports microelectronics modernization activities that enable defense systems to keep pace with commercial microelectronics technological advances, reduce reliance on obsolete microelectronics, and mitigate the Department’s reliance on sole source foundries for assured state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics.  It addresses the challenges of 1) having enduring access to a multiplicity of modern manufacturing processes that require commercial volumes to maintain long term viability and 2) protecting the intellectual property (IP) of the microelectronic parts that are manufactured.

This PE supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy’s (NDS) line of effort to build a more lethal force through modernization of key capabilities, the NDS defense objective of establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and sustains security and solvency, and the NDS strategic approach of reforming the Department’s business practices by simultaneously increasing performance and affordability while still minimizing risk.

This PE supports the OUSD(R&amp;E) Microelectronics Modernization Roadmap.  The primary areas of focus of this roadmap include the following:  access to advanced packaging and test; quantifiable assurance and secure design; foundry access; verification and validation; policies, standards, and Joint Federated Assurance Center (JFAC) governing body; access to radiation hardened microelectronics; access to non-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) SOTA microelectronics; disruptive research and development; education and workforce development; trusted foundry and obsolescence; and supply chain awareness and security.

Recognizing that an assured supply of microelectronics is a U.S. Government (USG)-wide concern, this activity will interface with interagency partners to take into account interagency requirements, opportunities for collaboration, and strategic decisions that can be made to limit the overall cost of these requirements to the USG. 

This activity is being led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds a program of research to demonstrate the next generation, technology-driven approach to microelectronics trust and assurance, to include state-of-the-art (SOTA) microelectronics, to ensure continued access to SOTA microelectronic technologies, while maintaining the required level of assurance in all environments.  DoD’s ability to access commercial technology for its custom secure, trusted and assured needs is diminishing as SOTA suppliers become fewer and more focused on serving the global commercial market.  DoD’s technology needs are broad, and relying on a single source supplier is not feasible.  Alternative, advanced manufacturing methods, technologies, and design tools are needed to produce secure, trusted and assured SOTA parts from commercial sources and to preserve access to these advanced nodes while protecting DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) intellectual property (IP) from exploitation.  It is also intended to dramatically improve the capabilities of the core trusted and assured microelectronics (T&amp;AM) laboratories with regard to verification and validation in support of microelectronics assurance.

This program of research will demonstrate quantitative and innovative design, manufacturing, imaging, tagging, and control and assessment approaches for protecting DoD’s microelectronics supply chain and IP.  Furthermore a quantitative assurance methodology using metrics from assurance mitigations will be demonstrated to enable access to SOTA microelectronics.  Assurance mitigations will be demonstrated for Field Programmable Gate Array devices in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems, obfuscation and disaggregation technologies, and other assurance mitigations.  It will demonstrate advanced imaging technologies and forensics, Design for Assurance techniques, active hardware assurance controls, electronic component markers, and a data and analysis capability to enable auditing, lifecycle provenance and traceability, and independent verification and validation of commercial and specialized DoD designs and IP.  It also demonstrates and implements concepts for the cost-effective production of custom microelectronics in low volumes and protection of sensitive IP from exploitation.  In addition it demonstrates and implements new technologies to assess the security of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) assurance mechanisms.

Assurance technologies that can be applied in a broad range of trusted and commercial environments can mitigate the risks associated with sole-source suppliers, and increase the ability of the U.S. Government (USG) to leverage commercial capabilities.  The suite of demonstrated technologies, e.g., alternative manufacturing methods and design tools, will enable DoD to obfuscate the purpose of sensitive devices, verify their origin and function, and protect sensitive IP from exploitation even while using the global supply chain for most hardware.  In cases where the risk involved precludes that level of commercial collaboration, low-volume manufacturing technologies demonstrated under this project would permit DoD to more cheaply produce low volumes of sensitive microelectronics in secure environments.  The project will also support demonstration of a repository of third-party IP and electronic design automation (EDA) and assurance tool marketplace to expedite circuit design and transition promising technologies to use.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

• Demonstrate acquisition program pilots and technology demonstrations, followed by transition of these capabilities to new programs in the following fiscal years.
• Evaluate quantifiable assurance technologies and techniques through efforts that may include the conduct of studies, broad agency announcements (BAAs), and other efforts to coordinate research programs across USG R&amp;D organizations, academia and industry.
• Identify potential transition issues and aid in transition through joint collaboration between research teams and stakeholders with a focus on evaluations of prototypes, test articles and beta versions of tools, IP, techniques, methods, etc. and their use in operationally-realistic scenarios.
• Demonstrate and evaluate new quantifiable assurance technologies for FPGA devices through BAA awards selected in FY 2019 and throughout FY 2020.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the DoD microelectronics strategy by ensuring the availability of and access to the advanced, assured microelectronics that are critical for DoD and national security systems.  It will deliver tools to protect the IP confidentiality and integrity for a broad range of systems and missions and will provide a path for the production of these articles.   

This project supports a broader national strategy to focus resources, policies, and incentives to enhance current and next generation defense capability by:
1) maintaining access to U.S. domestic production of state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology; 
2) enabling solutions for DoD heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging needs; 
3) leveraging commercial technology through demonstrations with industry of dual-use technologies with built in assurance, and incentivizing stronger commercial engagement through piloting acquisition reforms and providing incentives for cooperative R&amp;D and trade; 
4) enhancing state-of-the-practice (SOTP) foundries in the U.S. to produce more advanced technologies to better serve low-volume customers in the aerospace and defense community; 
5) accelerating the transition and capture of the next generation of microelectronics through commercial partnerships and lowering domestic barriers to innovation in coordination with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI); and 
6) promoting threat awareness, proactive protection, and supply chain security to ensure these investments continue to benefit the U.S.

MINSEC activities are categorized into the following focus areas:  access to specialized SOTA and dual use microelectronics technology, collection and analysis of data for metrics driven quantifiable assurance, maintaining and enhancing U.S capability though capture and secure, and transition of next generation microelectronics technology including demonstration and capability insertion; microelectronics-focused workforce training; radiation hardening by process (RHBP) and radiation hardening by design (RHBD) in advanced technology nodes for next-generation strategic systems; and radio frequency (RF) and optoelectronic (OE) microelectronics.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The enhancement will demonstrate quantifiably assured design concepts in manufactured systems, enabling a formal risk-based approach to protection techniques. Manufactured microelectronics will be tested to ensure that IP protections meet or exceed current National Security Agency (NSA) standards for intellectual property (IP) protection, and to demonstrate DoD’s ability to detect certain malicious supply chain attacks on DoD microelectronics.

The enhancement will also demonstrate a new data driven quantifiable assurance paradigm for supply chain protection.  It will strengthen security while improving access, exposing no sensitive IP to the foundry and requiring post-manufacture validation of foundry products. The enhancement will demonstrate quantifiably assured design concepts in manufactured systems, enabling a formal risk-based approach to protection techniques. Manufactured microelectronics will be tested to ensure that IP protections meet or exceed current NSA standards for IP protection, and to demonstrate DoD’s ability to detect certain malicious supply chain attacks on DoD microelectronics. 

Successful implementation will transition these technologies to use in DoD programs, obtain access to multiple commercial microelectronics facilities, and solidify a data-driven approach to supply chain protection, including keeping pace with the rapid advancements in microelectronics technology and the globalization of this industry sector. It will provide the basics for updating and strengthening DoD assurance policy and includes collaborating with industry to employ data driven quantifiable standards.</r2:Description>

The Government must sustain specialty suppliers, given their criticality to national security.  In particular, DoD needs access to a diverse microelectronics ecosystem to develop and acquire the application specific integrated circuit (ASICs) and personalized commercial off the shelf (COTS) components required for military radiation hardened and radio frequency and optical needs.  

The Department frequently relies on commercial suppliers to optimize performance and reduce costs for sophisticated weapon system and secure network functionality.  It is critical that DoD has future access to subject matter expertise, technology, and manufacturing.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>DoD will partner with the intelligence community, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to demonstrate radiation hardened components that permit systems to operate in space and other harsh environments.  State-of-the-practice (SOTP) and SOTA technologies will be characterized and developed in support of Radiation Hardened By Process (RHBP) and Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) activities in support DoD modernization programs with radiation hardened requirements. A similar situation exists for radio frequency and optical applications.  These two applications reflect only a small market with unique costs and specifications, which does not inherently create incentive for industrial investment.
          
Planned activities transitioning from projects P-809 and P-822 as follows:
• Demonstrate enhanced DoD Lab test and evaluation infrastructure required for verification and validation of radiation hardened microelectronics, technology characterization, and device modeling and simulation.
• Demonstrate advance radiation harden System on Chip(SOC) and memory technology in support DoD program modernization efforts with radiation hardened requirements.
• Demonstrate SOTP and SOTA technologies utilizing Radiation Hardened By Process (RHBP) and Radiation Hardened By Design (RHBD) activities in support DoD modernization programs with radiation hardened requirements.
• Provide coordination and subject matter expertise in support of the Strategic Radiation Hardened Electronics council (SRHEC) for the identification of technology gaps, technology roadmap development, and inform future investments.
• Procure and evaluate advanced Gallium Nitride (GaN) substrates to establish an assured source.  
• Demonstrate assured GaN radio frequency (RF) foundry technology and host secure design challenges to optimize SOTA radio frequency optoelectronics (RFOE) intellectual property (IP) and test articles for frequency, bandwidth, efficiency, power, etc. 
• Major milestones will be GaN wafer deliveries and assured GaN RF circuits via Secure Design Challenge.  
• Continue to enhance the foundations of assurance for RF and optoelectronics (OE) applications by demonstrating new capabilities such as additive manufacturing.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) is not a new start.  It is a continuation of efforts previously contained in PE 0604771D8Z, Joint Tactical Information Distribution System.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment in her roles as the Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for NC3 and NC3 Capability Portfolio Manager (CPM) as directed by the Secretary of Defense in the NC3 Governance Improvement (NGI) Implementation Plan.  The NC3 Portfolio consists of ~200 systems, platforms, networks, and applications.  The goals of the CPM are to 1) Accelerate NC3 modernization programs to deliver integrated cost-effective capabilities, 2) Maintain the readiness of operational NC3 systems and 3) Increase technology upgrades and prototyping to enable the future capabilities to outpace the threat.  This program will develop the necessary tools and processes to assess integrated programmatic risk and to manage and oversee NC3 modernization and sustainment efforts. These tools include software, analytical expertise, and information storage and retrieval systems to support the continuing development of CPM for managing the complex NC3 enterprise.  These efforts will simultaneously support the Commander, USSTRATCOM as NC3 Enterprise Lead and through the Director of the NC3 Enterprise Center (NEC); systems engineering and architecture development entities; the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Research and Engineering (R&amp;E), the Joint Staff, and the Services.  This program supports the capability portfolio-based approach (DoD Directive 7045.02, “Capability Portfolio Management”).  

This program funds development of new tools, technical assessment and planning for the CPM to manage the NC3 enterprise.  This includes: 
1) developing and deploying software tools for improving NC3 enterprise-level management and programmatic risk assessment; 
2) serving as the office of primary responsibility for NC3 enterprise capability portfolio management (to include assessing current capability, complying with statutory mandates, and conducting NC3-related studies, analysis, and policy updates); 
3) assessing DoD Component plans, programs, and budgets for adequacy and execution (including course of action development and recommendations); 
4) identifying, prototyping, evaluating, and recommending new technology for inclusion in the NC3 system; 
5) supporting development of NC3 architecture updates and modernization aimed at system improvements;
6) developing NC3 corrective action and risk mitigation plans supported by senior investment decisions.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports development and operation of analytical tools to evaluate authoritative data (cost, schedule, performance, risk) on NC3 Portfolio programs to maximize portfolio alignment to strategic priorities and capabilities. It will create integrated development and delivery schedules for NC3 programs.  These tools will forecast system/capability degradation as well as plans for capability replacement, improvement, or replacement in the context of the larger NC3 enterprise.  It also provides the technical expertise to support risk management analysis (with an emphasis on system design, development and acquisition) of the NC3 enterprise and will develop strategies for synchronizing NC3 preplanned improvements.  It will support the timely exchange of program and capability status information between elements of the NC3 enterprise, the OSD staff, and the combatant commands with a goal of increasing the use of electronic means to provide current and accurate information on key elements of the NC3 enterprise.  

The effort will develop robust, integrated capability plans and schedules for NC3 capabilities to clarify system dependencies and identify disconnects.  It will also support cross-department collaboration for development of enterprise-wide approaches for capability management.  This includes: (1) vertical and horizontal integration activities within the Department and with the interagency where appropriate; (2) a coordinated portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; (3) reform efforts at the legislative, governance, policy, management and execution levels; 4) protection of information and technology that support or enables technology-based capability development for the NC3 warfighting domain and 5) supports the identification, evaluation, and incorporation of promising technology for inclusion in the NC3 system.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Program Element (PE) 0305304D8Z was established in FY 2013 supporting the Department’s goals for audit readiness, energy efficiency, Real Property accountability, and to improve data quality and integration across the full spectrum of Sustainment business functions.  The PE is used to conduct Business Process Re-engineering activities, developing and publishing data standards, and to build out data stores and portal requirements for Energy Resiliency and Conservation Investment Program (ERCIP) management.  Funding is also used to support ASD Sustainment Senior Real Property Officer accountability requirements such as reconciliation of enterprise real property inventory records and development of asset management processes, business rules and associated data standards.  A major component of this effort is fielding an enterprise Data Analytics &amp; Integration Support (DAIS) platform coupled with an independent verification &amp; validation capability, providing access to real time data through Web Services Description Language (WSDL) in support of timely, data-driven decision-making.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

This effort supports a multi-year real property-related control systems cyber security initiative to address these issues.  So far it has generated an updated DoD CIO RMF Knowledge Service Portal with controls systems cyber security implementation guidance for practitioners (templates, key references, step-by-step instructions, look-up tables, etc.)
Controls systems cyber security Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPS) has transitioned from Joint Base Architecture for Secure Industrial Control Systems (J-BASICS).  The department is implementing Platform Resilience Mission Assurance (PRMA) assessments across ten installations.
This effort has also generated policy direction to Services and Agencies including a draft Department of Defense Instruction, a draft Department of Defense Manual and Security Handling Guide for data representing energy systems.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Increase from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is the result of redistribution of funding from Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems: Advanced Technology Development (PE# 0303310D8Z) to CWMD Systems: System Development and Demonstration (PE# 0305310D8Z) and CWMD Systems: Operational Systems Development (PE# 0607310D8Z). This redistribution supports the Department’s need to prioritize investment in fieldable capabilities to enhance Joint Force lethality in countering WMD proliferation and use.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems portfolio aligns with the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”
 
The CWMD Systems portfolio enhances warfighter lethality by developing capabilities to analyze and exploit critical nodes of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and ballistic missile programs and proliferation networks; and developing offensively-oriented capabilities to disrupt WMD proliferation networks and detect, disable, or defeat WMD and delivery systems. Investments result in capabilities fielded to the Joint Force, enabling it to reduce WMD threats and create options for the United States to prevent WMD use.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense uses the CWMD Systems portfolio to invest strategically in projects across the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and Defense Agencies. Funding is prioritized for projects that close Joint Force warfighter capability gaps. An annual investment strategy is used to meet emergent operational and capability needs submitted by the Joint Force, yielding new fielded capabilities within one to two years.

The CWMD Systems: Systems Development and Demonstration program invests in maturation of prototypes; integration of technologies, systems and components; developmental and operational test and evaluation; and transition to fielded capabilities that counter WMD proliferation. This program accelerates and enables transition of mature technologies to fielded capabilities by leveraging significant science and technology (S&amp;T) investments made by the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and industry. Fielded capabilities illuminate WMD networks; exploit vulnerabilities in networks, programs, facilities, and weapons systems; and disable or defeat WMD. 
 
This appropriation funds labor, materials, and travel to support the requirements of this program, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contract with the government, for activities and acquisitions including RDT&amp;E, assessments and analyses, research studies, education, and other activities related to capability development and fielding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The CWMD Systems: Systems Development and Demonstration program invests in maturation of prototypes; integration of technologies, systems and components; developmental and operational test and evaluation; and transition to fielded capabilities that counter WMD proliferation. This program accelerates and enables transition of mature technologies to fielded capabilities by leveraging significant science and technology (S&amp;T) investments made by the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and industry. Fielded capabilities illuminate WMD networks; exploit vulnerabilities in networks, programs, facilities, and weapons systems; and disable or defeat WMD. 
 
This appropriation funds labor, materials, and travel to support the requirements of this program, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contract with the government, for activities and acquisitions including RDT&amp;E, assessments and analyses, research studies, education, and other activities related to capability development and fielding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Threat Reduction and Arms Control (TRAC) establishes annual priorities based on national and DoD strategies and senior leader guidance. Based on those priorities, TRAC solicits project proposals from Combatant Commands, Military Services, and Defense Agencies, and interagency partners. To be selected, a proposed project must have a validated requirement, an engaged requirement champion, a viable acquisition strategy, and a qualified program management office. A technology project must identify its starting and desired end-state Technology Readiness Level. Likewise, the end-user for any proposed project must demonstrate a long-term plan for acceptance and sustainment of a fieldable capability. Project period of performance is typically 12-18 months.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding supports the Defense Readiness Reporting System - Strategic, (DRRS-S,) the comprehensive readiness reporting system for the Department of Defense mandated under Title 10 U.S. Code.  The system measures in an objective, accurate, and timely manner the capability of the armed forces to carry out the National Security Strategy prescribed by the President, as well as the defense planning guidance provided by the Secretary of Defense and the National Military Strategy prescribed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  DRRS-S hosts information and applications used to support the Geographic and Functional Combatant Commanders, the Services, Combat Support Agencies, the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

DRRS-S is the evolution of readiness reporting to a more comprehensive system, better able to meet the Department’s current and future readiness information challenges.  Included in these challenges is the expansion in scope of the entities who can, and do report readiness, as well as what they report.  Shifting from solely resource centric readiness reporting to a resource informed mission/capabilities based reporting system, oriented towards the National Military Strategy (NMS), makes substantially more complex demands on readiness reporting, but portrays a far more relevant and holistic picture of readiness.  DRRS-S allows the Department to assess readiness globally based on the program’s integrated ability to project and sustain a mix of constructed forces in simultaneous engagements.  Additionally, the challenges associated with sourcing and evaluating the readiness of our forces engaged in on-going real operations mean that force managers need applications that will query the entire Department for suitable, available organizations to meet current needs.  DRRS-S continues to incorporate more data, and develop more capable functionality to meet the needs of both the operational employers of the Force, but also those responsible for Force Generation. 

FY2019 NDAA made revisions to Title 10 U.S. Code and provided the Department of Defense direction requiring growth in the DRRS-S program and identified the program’s need to maintain the technical currency necessary to quickly meet future challenges associated with providing senior leaders with relevant and timely information.  Such initiatives include implementing the complex data structures and visualization tools needed to operationalize the Global Force Management - Data Initiative, and reporting at lower organizational levels consistent with how Forces are actually employed.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) establishes a capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness information system for DoD.  DRRS measures the readiness of military forces and supporting infrastructure to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense.  The realization of DRRS required integrating a host of key technologies to achieve an information system that supports distributed, collaborative, and dynamic readiness reporting in addition to continuous tool-based assessment.  The primary technical goal was the creation of a highly reliable and securely integrated readiness data environment to leverage and extend current readiness information systems.  DRRS contains readiness metrics and supporting data for forces and support organizations.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2020, the increase of approximately $4.000 million in Joint Systems Architecture Development account is due to new and expanded mission areas and requirements in the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition (ASD(A)) portfolio as a result of the USD (A&amp;S) re-organization.  In addition, these funds will support the Electromagnetic Warfare Executive Committee (EW EXCOMM) pursue solutions to issues such as Electronic Battle Management (EMBM), and the development of a comprehensive electronic warfare strategy to identify gaps and requirements across the Department. The funds will include support to the mission engineering analyses and integration to incorporate soft kill and Electronic Warfare effects, and weapon systems in critical mission thread areas in order to meet evolving threats.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Department and acquisition reform initiatives call for top down, national security strategy-driven capabilities-based planning. Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 5000.02 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01 promulgate capabilities-based requirements and acquisition processes. The JSAD program enables collaborative efforts to achieve these goals with a focus on Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs). These efforts include warfighting capability-based analyses; assessments of joint capability areas and joint integrating concepts; development of system-related data; integrated roadmaps to support acquisition investment decisions; and assessments of MDAPs in a capability area context.  Activities in the JSAD project are divided into three areas:  (1) capability-based analysis; (2) roadmaps; and (3) support tools and guidance. Capability-based analysis provides analysis of the different technology, functionality, and integration impacts of systems on warfighting capability.  Acquisition roadmaps guide systems development and associated investment plans.  JSAD support tools and guidance initiatives develop systems data, and tools, exploit modeling and simulation and architecture efforts to improve DoD’s overall assessment capability.  These efforts guide the development and improve the testing and fielding of integrated systems of systems in order to achieve Joint mission capabilities.  The Department has also undergone an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches, which includes:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  To accomplish this intent, there needs to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from systems acquisition to capabilities-based portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) direction outlined above in order to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals.  The program is broken up into two focus areas (Portfolio Management and Reform Initiatives).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department's 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) laid out the need for an institutional reorientation or shift in emphasis from organization-specific to enterprise-wide approaches which meant:  (1) horizontal integration within the Department and unity of effort through greater interagency collaboration; (2) engaging in a coordinated and portfolio-based approach to planning, programming, budgeting and execution; and (3) significant reforms at the governance, management and execution levels.  The Department’s 2010 QDR report further addressed reforming how we buy, noting that the conventional acquisition process is too long and too cumbersome to fit the needs of the many systems that require continuous changes and upgrades - a challenge that will become only more pressing over time. Better Buying Power (BBP) is the implementation of best practices to strengthen the Defense Department's buying power, improve industry productivity, and provide an affordable, value-added military capability to the Warfighter.  Launched in 2010, BBP encompasses a set of fundamental acquisition principles to achieve greater efficiencies through affordability, cost control, elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy, and promotion of competition. BBP initiatives also incentivize productivity and innovation in industry and Government, and improve tradecraft in the acquisition of services. The Department will improve how it matches requirements with mature technologies, maintains disciplined systems engineering approaches.  To accomplish this direction, there needed to be a focused goal and concerted emphasis on shifting from acquisition of individual systems to portfolio management (or portfolio systems acquisition).  This program enables collaborative efforts to implement the QDR direction outlined above and advance BBP initiatives to achieve portfolio systems acquisition goals and to develop and implement acquisition reform initiatives.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Since its inception in FY 1990, this program element (PE) funds the development of critically needed, high-priority Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) capabilities for joint/multi-Service requirements. Projects under the CTEIP PE support the National Defense Strategy and align with the USD R&amp;E priorities.  CTEIP funds projects in Hypersonics, Directed Energy, Cyber Security/Electronic Warfare, Missile Defense, Nuclear Effects, Space Autonomy and Command/Control and Communications.  Other Investments align with objectives in the Strategic Plan for DoD T&amp;E Resources for high priority test needs and common range Infrastructure.  

The Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) uses a corporate investment approach to combine Service, Defense, and other Government agencies T&amp;E needs, maximize opportunities for joint efforts and avoid unwarranted duplication of test capabilities. CTEIP evaluates and selects for execution those proposed projects that best provide the greatest return on investment; make efficient use of limited test resources; leverage Service investment; and promote joint solutions to fill test capability gaps.  CTEIP provides enterprise solutions that benefit the Department as a whole.  The CTEIP PE supports two basic tasks: investments to improve and develop the test capabilities base (Joint Improvement and Modernization (JIM) projects) and development of near-term solutions to test capability shortfalls in support of ongoing operational test programs (Resource Enhancement Projects (REP).

The JIM funds critically needed T&amp;E investments in the major areas across the USD R&amp;E priorities and planned investments which continue to drive innovations on our Major Ranges and Test Facility Bases to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of testing.  Examples of Critical investments include infrastructure developments needed for testing hypersonic weapon systems, electronic warfare threat emulators long range airborne telemetry, mobile optical tracking, nuclear survivability and unmanned and autonomous systems. CTEIP continues to serve as the focal point for fostering common architectures throughout the test and training communities to enhance the sharing of resources and linkages between test and training ranges.  

The REP funds development of near-term solutions for critical ongoing operational tests supporting decisions on major, high-priority defense acquisition programs.  These unanticipated operational test (OT) capability requirements arise from several sources such as a new threat system identified during OT planning, acquisition of foreign military assets that are critical in determining weapon system operational effectiveness and emerging technologies and test requirements resulting from operational concept changes mandated by Congress or Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), or system-of-systems testing. Funding these activities under the CTEIP provides the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these near-term test requirements with the total DoD test and evaluation investment planning, and ensures their availability for other programs that may have similar testing requirements.
This Budget Activity 6 PE includes special studies, analyses, project improvements, quick reaction efforts and strategic planning related to test capabilities and infrastructure.  Additionally, this activity supports the development and application of proven technologies to provide major test and evaluation capabilities required to meet DoD testing requirements for component weapon systems.

Detailed below is the description of the FY2021 CTEIP budget.  FY2021 includes increased investments in high-priority hypersonic ground and open air range test capability developments, for critically needed upgrades to DoD Threat Models and Simulations, investments in High Energy Laser testing, revitalization and improvements of the Nuclear Effects testing capability and efforts to test autonomous vehicles both virtually and live.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Initial investment projects develop and field the RF threat emulation systems needed to keep up with evolving advanced, sophisticated threats to support planned MRTFB open air range test events. The investment roadmap also incorporates multi-year initiatives to provide expanded land range coverage enabling airborne participants to operate seamlessly across test or training ranges and initiatives to develop the aircraft and ground instrumentation, distributed LVC simulation environments, data collection and processing to enable interoperability across multiple ranges and platforms.</r2:AppChangeSummary>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program provides a Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise-wide test capability to support system-to-system interoperability testing, mission-level environment testing, and cyber event operations, including cyber testing, cyber training, cyber experimentation, and cyber mission rehearsal.  The JMETC program implements the infrastructure capabilities defined in the DoD “Testing in a Joint Environment Roadmap” to provide acquisition program managers a robust nation-wide capability to “test like we fight.”  The JMETC program provides a persistent, distributed test and evaluation (T&amp;E) capability that supports system development to measure and improve interoperability performance and cyber resiliency, which otherwise would not be readily available to Service/Component acquisition programs.  The JMETC program is funded within the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Management Support Budget Activity because it provides test capability in support of RDT&amp;E programs.  By linking distributed facilities, as well as providing the necessary tools, services and subject matter expertise, the JMETC program allows acquisition programs to efficiently evaluate their warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.  The JMETC Program has been aligned to advance the National Defense Strategy (NDS), to test the development of resilient, survivable, federated networks and information ecosystems from the tactical level up to strategic planning, as well as test and assess cyber defenses, building a more lethal force.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) is comprised of cyber ranges and a secure distributed network infrastructure to service the cyber range user community.  The NCRC currently consists of five functional cyber ranges, including the National Cyber Range in Florida as well as four Regional Service Delivery Points (RSDP) located in Hawaii, Alabama, Maryland, and Massachusetts.  To enhance DoD cyber range test and training capability and capacity, the NCRC is being expanded with additional cyber ranges co-located with key Service organizations to support an increase of cyber testing of DoD systems as well as training of cyber warfighters.  The JMETC Multiple Independent Level of Security (MILS) Network (JMN) currently links 58 sites across the DoD, industry, and academia, providing secure access between cyber ranges, laboratories, and facilities.  Both the cyber ranges and the network infrastructure are accredited to support multiple levels of security classifications, specifically configured to meet particular cyber event requirements.  The NCRC investments have been aligned to support the National Defense Strategy in improving cyber defense, cyber resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations.
The NCRC conducts cyberspace test and training events for the full spectrum of DoD customers including research, development, acquisition, testing, training and operational Cyber Mission Forces (CMF).  The NCRC executes wide variety of event types including science and technology (S&amp;T) demonstrations, developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E), operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E), security controls assessments, cyberspace operations training, refinement of cyberspace tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) Development, forensics/malware analysis) and cyberspace operations mission rehearsal.  The NCRC enables acquisition programs to conduct cybersecurity test and evaluation in an operationally representative cyberspace environment enabling identification, validation and mitigation of vulnerabilities.  The NCRC also supports training, mission rehearsal and certification of the CMF in support of US Cyber Command by enabling operational forces to efficiently evaluate cyber warfighting capability in a realistic joint mission environment.
The NCRC provides secure facilities, technology, processes, and workforce to rapidly create hi-fidelity, mission-representative friendly, neutral, and adversarial cyberspace environments.  
The NCRC also facilitates integration of distributed organizations with different missions and workforce relevant to cyber operations (e.g., cyber operators, penetrations testers, cyber assessors, cyber observers, cyber analysts, etc.).  The NCRC supports cyber activities across of a full spectrum of DoD systems, including weapon platforms, C4I systems, business systems, network devices, and other systems vulnerable to a cyber-attack.  The NCRC extensively utilizes automation to minimize human error, to reduce the time required to set-up for a cyber event, and to ensure repeatable results.  In addition, the NCRC employs post-event sanitization techniques on all assets after exposure to malicious code to restore back to a known, clean state, which allows for reuse in future events.  
The NCRC has a multidisciplinary workforce with software, systems, network, virtualization, automation, system administration, and cybersecurity subject matter expertise.  In support of successful planning and execution of hosted events, the NCRC workforce helps users define and refine their event objectives, assists with identifying and prioritizing potential vulnerabilities, designs virtualized cyber environments, develops customized traffic generation and instrumentation solutions, integrates 3rd party hardware and software, executes cyber events on behalf of the user, provides cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments, performs detailed cyber analysis, and delivers detailed reports on the results.  In addition, the NCRC workforce supports both the Executive Agent for Cyber Test Ranges and the Executive Agent for Cyber Training Ranges, to identify and address relevant needs, define and promulgate standards, and seek efficiencies through focused investments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to manage studies, analyses, strategic planning, and technical support efforts to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analyses are predominantly performed by independent sources outside of the government such as universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and other private not-for-profit sources.  Research requirements will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections. With the complexities of present and emerging advanced security threats in the current geopolitical environment, these investments in knowledge to inform senior leadership and support planning for the mid and long-term is vital to remaining strategically competitive.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>This program was reduced by $12.270 million dollars as a result of the FY 2021 Defense Wide Review (DWR).  The DWR focused on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage."    

An additional reduction in program funds in the amount of $5.985 million reflects realignment of budget authority to other programs for studies and analyses within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for FY 2021 and beyond.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program is a key source of funding for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to manage studies, analyses, strategic planning, and technical support efforts to improve and support policy development, decision making, management and administration of DoD programs and activities. Studies and analyses are predominantly performed by independent sources outside of the government such as universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and other private not-for-profit sources.  Research requirements will examine current and alternative policies, plans, operations, strategies and budgets, providing essential means for managing and responding to the shifting and complex international, political, technological, economic, military, and acquisition environments in which national security planning decisions are made.  Independent analyses from subject matter experts are instrumental for senior defense planners in making informed choices regarding requirements for force planning and strategic deployment of assets taking into account technological challenges and resource constraints, and there is a strong need to incorporate the findings of operational analysis in force planning requirements and projections.  With the complexities of present and emerging advanced security threats in the current geopolitical environment, these investments in knowledge to inform senior leadership and support planning for the mid and long-term is vital to remaining strategically competitive.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) establishes the dedicated funding line to carry out the mission integration and systems engineering duties as described in Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, "Establishment of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment," July 13, 2018.  

In alignment with the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Systems Engineering (SE) PE supports a more lethal force by analyzing near-, mid-, and long-term approaches to realizing mission capability, assessing that capability against anticipated adversaries in relevant operational environments, and determining revised system, architectural, tech surprise opportunities to maintain tactical edge, insert technology, improve interoperability and formulate long-term strategies to retain or improve our capabilities against our adversaries. Deputy Director, Engineering (DD, Eng) oversees, initiates, and recommends opportunities to align technology investments to accelerate capability delivery, or modifying existing systems.  This program supports:

(1) Reforming the Department for greater performance and affordability by maintaining visibility into major programs and conducting independent technical risk assessments (ITRAs) to advise the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) and Milestone Decision Authorities on progress towards achieving key performance parameters, technology maturation, interoperability, and cyber security posture;
(2) Modernizing key capabilities and mission priorities through technical support for mission engineering and establishing budget priorities; and
(3) Cultivates workforce talent by both developing engineering methods, policies, processes, and tools that are cross cutting technologies and integrating technical disciplines to advance DoD engineering practices and providing advocacy and oversight for the Department's engineering workforce to build a capable, current, and innovative engineering workforce. 

In FY 2019, this PE began activities to carry out responsibilities described in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 855 titled Mission Integration Management (MIM).

In FY 2020, funding from Project Code 143, Program Protection, was re-aligned to a new Maintaining Technology Advantage Program Element (PE) 0605797D8Z, to support efforts which have transitioned to the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (STP&amp;E).

Beginning in FY 2021, DoD Modeling and Simulation Management Office (MSMO) funding, Engineering Resilient Systems (ERS), and Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) activities aligned with the national defense modernization priorities and transitioned from Engineering Science and Technology (PE 0603833D8Z) to Systems Engineering (PE 0605142D8Z).  Additionally, the Test &amp; Evaluation Policy Workforce is transferred from Development Test &amp; Evaluation (PE 0605804D8Z) to Systems Engineering (PE 0605142D8Z).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program element (PE) supports the program protection activities of the Deputy Director, Strategic Technology Protection and Exploitation (DD, STP&amp;E).  The Department of Defense (DoD) must address cybersecurity and supply chain risks to DoD networks, weapons systems, and information stored and processed on both DoD and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) unclassified contractor information networks that support DoD programs.  Increased reliance on the internet as a vehicle for sharing information, globalization of the supply chain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that can evade commercially available security tools and defeat generic security best practices, drives the need for diligent program protection planning and execution.  Program Protection Planning (PPP) includes protection of classified and unclassified controlled technical information, critical program information, critical components, and critical mission functions, and integrates high-level security policies and practical expertise to specific acquisition and S&amp;T practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor information networks; improve mitigation and management of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, improve software assurance practices, mature processes to identify and protect Critical Program Information and improve program protection planning.  Activities carried out, support implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.44 Trusted Systems and Networks with the use of proven mitigation techniques and tools, the ongoing refinement of risk management processes, and creation of needed technology; implementation of DoD Instruction 5200.39  Critical Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) to identify and protect Critical Program Information; and implementation of DoD Instruction 8582.01 Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems for Safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor owned networks.

DD, STP&amp;E provides independent assessments of research, technology and defense acquisition program’s system security engineering and program protection implementation.

The DD, STP&amp;E reviews and approves the PPP for each Major Defense Acquisition Program, and monitors and reviews the system security engineering planning activities of MDAPs and other defense acquisition programs, as directed by the Secretary of Defense.  

This PE includes efforts by the office of the DD, STP&amp;E in implementing the Department’s Trusted Defense System Strategy.  Specifically, the PE will develop and mature the critical sub discipline of systems engineering - system security engineering (SSE), Hardware and Software Assurance, and the Comprehensive Program Protection Planning process that implements a risk-based approach to protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and information in acquisition programs.  These efforts include study and maturation of policy, guidance, system security discipline fundamentals, such as engineering methods, tools, and best practices, and establishing a coalition of assurance activities across the DoD to provide analytical and technical support to acquisition programs.  These activities will be promulgated in defense acquisition as a fundamental element of the DD, STP&amp;E systems engineering and technical reviews. 

In FY 2020, funding from this project will transfer to the Maintaining Technology Advantage PE 0605797D8Z, in alignment with the DD, STP&amp;E mission.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>FYDP funding increases are addressing the need for technical experts to assist with the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group and nuclear deterrent modeling and analysis to help make data-driven decisions for nuclear modernization efforts.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Nuclear Matters is to ensure the continued credibility, effectiveness, safety, and security of the U.S. deterrent in order to deter nuclear and non-nuclear attack; assure U.S. allies and partners; achieve U.S. objectives if deterrence fails; and hedge against an uncertain future. Nuclear Matters serves as the DoD focal point for the modernization and sustainment of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, as well as for a wide range of nuclear counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation issues. 

The funds for this program are used to support research, development, test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons modernization, sustainment; security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety; and survivability requirements. Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses and assessments; DoD-National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security.  Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response. Additionally, Nuclear Matters serves as the focal point for DoD activities and initiatives related to the dual missions of sustaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent and countering the threat from nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation.  

Nuclear Matters is leading a Tri-Lab effort (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories) to provide data-driven, mission engineering support to integrated portfolio management for 21st Century nuclear deterrent sustainment and modernization. The United States is modernizing all three legs of its nuclear triad and is also reconstituting its nuclear weapons production capability at roughly the same time, while simultaneously sustaining weapons and systems that have aged well beyond their original design lives. The Nuclear Weapons Council and the Nuclear Deterrent Enterprise Review Group need to manage the transition from legacy Cold War delivery systems and weapons to replacement systems and warheads and make decisions that will affect U.S. national security through the end of the 21st Century. To field a modern, threat-informed nuclear deterrent that will keep pace with evolving adversary capabilities, it is necessary to quantify and compare the relative performance contributions of a variety of military characteristics and weapons options to make data-driven decisions concerning the future of the U.S. nuclear deterrent.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The mission of the Nuclear Matters program is to sustain the U.S. nuclear deterrent posture, counter nuclear threats, and to develop nuclear and conventional physical security equipment. The funds for this program are used to support developmental and test and evaluation efforts as well as studies and analyses for nuclear weapons security; use control; nuclear weapons stockpile safety, survivability and performance; nuclear threat reduction and office management.  

Funds are also used to develop and implement plans for stockpile transformation; infrastructure analyses, assessments and models; NWC activities, as mandated by Title 10 USC, section 179; radiological and nuclear emergency response efforts; and management of international programs of nuclear cooperation, particularly with respect to enhancing international nuclear safety and security.  

Nuclear Matters is also responsible for policy development and implementation for personnel reliability; nuclear weapons, nuclear command and control, and special nuclear materials security; use control; nuclear weapons transportation; physical security equipment; countering nuclear threats; and nuclear and radiological incident response.

This appropriation will finance work, including manpower, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contractual or grant arrangement with the government who conduct research (systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied), development (systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research, for the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes) and test and evaluation efforts.

This Program Element can fund travel to support the requirements of this program.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>To meets its security needs and those of its allies, the U.S. will need a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future.  There's increased risk, absent nuclear testing, in assuring long-term safety and reliability of today’s aging stockpile—the legacy warheads left over from the Cold War.  Today’s nuclear weapons complex is not sufficiently “responsive” to technical problems in the stockpile, or to potential emerging threats.  The task is to ensure the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and supporting infrastructure, meets long-term national security needs.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>In order to overcome evolving threats to the U.S. nuclear deterrent, the NWC must understand the trade space, payoffs, challenges, and increases or decreases in effectiveness related to decisions regarding nuclear warheads and their associated delivery systems and platforms. Nuclear Matters is providing data-driven decision making and mission engineering support using a Tri-Lab effort (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories) that uses advanced physics-based and stochastic analytics to provide NWC decision makers with threat-informed choices regarding U.S. nuclear deterrent modernization and sustainment.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports Global Positioning System (GPS) User Equipment Synchronization with GPS space and operational control segments to conduct DoD CIO oversight of Global Positioning System (GPS) management and planning activities required for meeting JCIDs requirements. Funding supports policy and guidance for incorporation of alternative means of PNT delivery to augment GPS. Funding also supports the DoD’s PNT Oversight Council and inputs into interagency activities under the National Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee.

In support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), GPS continues to provide a force multiplier for the Joint Force and key US allies. Its modernization, and alternative, complement means of PNT provision will maintain this advantage. Superior PNT provides enhanced Joint Force lethality through precision targeting, exacting ISR, efficient logistics, blue force tracking, and a myriad of other force enhancements. These are enjoyed by the Joint Force and key US allies. As such, they ensure efficient and effective force employment.

The Integrated Planning and Management Project encompasses the Nuclear Management Office's (NMO) responsibilities for establishing overall DoD policy and oversight with respect to the capability development, interoperability, standards, and architecture for National Command Capabilities for our Nation’s Senior Leadership.  The NMO serves as the single point of contact within the Department for policy, long-range plans, programs and budget, integrated mission advocacy, and management of decision-maker capabilities.  NMO’s objective is to ensure capabilities are in place to provide complete and timely situational awareness and decision tools for senior decision-makers.  Additionally, the NMO assists the DoD CIO as the Executive Agent and primary OSD advocate for the White House Military Office with oversight of a wide range of DoD command, control, and communications (C3) assets and oversees the efforts of the Services and Agencies in the design, integration, and deployment of critical and sensitive C3 capabilities.  Two overall areas of focus include: 1) National Senior Leader C3 Systems, National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP), DoD support to Civil Authorities; Continuity of Government (COG); 2) Cyber Mission Indications and Warnings.

NMO provides guidance, oversight and policy direction support for Senior Leadership communications and Continuity communications which enable the National Security Strategy's "build a more lethal force" line of effort.  By coordinating and integrating with the National Security Agency in the development of a security policy that provides guidance to the NMO community on cyber secure connection interfaces and security patterns on a continuous basis to addresses hardware, firmware and software vulnerabilities.  Working with DISA, the Services, and other federal government agencies to ensure the safety of our Nation's critical undersea cable infrastructure.  Provide guidance and oversight to all NMO cryptographic modernization programs, ensure NSA and the appropriate Service delivers their cryptographic capability on time and work with the combatant commanders' staff to ensure they have operationalized any potential risks with potential cryptographic program delays.

Coordinate the DoD's critical time dissemination resiliency plans and initiatives with senior representatives from the precision, navigation and timing (PNT) community.  Work with the Joint Staff, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps to ensure their PNT plans include primary and alternate capabilities.  Continue analysis of White House, DoD Services, DoD Agencies and Combatant Command initiatives to ensure the effectiveness of our airborne command, control and communications, commercial and military satellite communications, and their supporting ground infrastructure.  Analysis will ensure our Senior Leadership C3 is operationally effective during all phases of a conflict.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Integrated Planning and Management (NMO):
Continue NLCC Modeling and Simulation and Analysis – Continue to provide oversight and guidance to the DISA/JSEIO in developing end-to-end campaign-level modeling and simulation tools for NLCC. The research and development of the tools continued to increase the capabilities of MASSC (conferencing capabilities), NC3-N ExAMS (analysis of nodes, metrics and assets associated with a Navy communications system) and NISM (provide extendable, transparent multi-level simulation of scenarios).  Deliverable will determine COCOM OPLAN risk in denied environments.

Provide oversight and guidance on Maritime Information Systems (MIS) and Submarine Fiber Optic Cables (SFOC) and associated infrastructure.  These activities will encompass overseeing analysis of requirements, identifying communications capability shortfalls and interoperability issues, assessing equipment performance issues and exploring future communications improvements.  This includes technical expertise and systems engineering expertise in support of acquisition, planning, procurement, installation, operations and sustainment of MIS and SFOC capabilities.  

Provide technical expertise and oversight of Senior Leader C3 Systems and platforms including fixed and mobile communications capabilities of the White House, Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other identified Senior Leaders. These activities will encompass consolidating Senior Leader operational mission requirements, identifying communications capability shortfalls and interoperability issues, assessing equipment performance issues and exploring future communications improvements.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SBIR/STTR Program is executed in three phases. The purpose of Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific technical and commercial merit, and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR/STTR Program. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. Phase III SBIR/STTR efforts derive from, extend or conclude Phase I or Phase II efforts, and are not funded with SBIR/STTR funds. Under Phase III, companies participating in the SBIR/STTR Program are expected to obtain funding from the private sector and/or non-SBIR/ STTR government sources to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military and/or private sector markets. This PE funds the administrative support to the SBIR/STTR programs including policy development, monitoring program execution for participating DOD agencies, outreach to small businesses, training for DOD small business and contracting professionals, and an annual conference to bring together the stakeholders for networking and program updates.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This continuity of effort is being transferred from the Defense Technical Analysis PE 0605798D8Z and the Systems Engineering PE 0605142D8Z beginning in FY 2020 to more appropriately align the efforts within the current Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)) organization.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element provides funding to support efforts to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  The targeting of U.S. capabilities by our strategic competitors create the potential to degrade core U.S. military technological advantages through unwanted technology transfer.  The technology transfer, primarily unclassified technology, threatens DoD's ability to maintain the technology advantage required to support the lethality and survivability of the Joint Force.  DoD is executing a campaign plan to maintain DoD's technology advantage.  First, DoD is promoting strategic technology investment to provide DoD access to new and innovative technology.  These investments are required to create breakthroughs in key areas of basic research, foster transition and decrease time to market of applied research to economically viable companies, and harvest U.S. innovation or with likeminded allies.  

Secondly, DoD must ensure its strategic technology investments are protected against unwanted technology transfer by developing and maintaining the tools and techniques that enable the U.S. engage in technology transfer at the time, place, and parties of our choosing.  

Thirdly, DoD must combat adversaries' attempts to thwart U.S. technology security mechanisms to control technology transfer.  The Department will support these three efforts by developing the appropriate suite of analytic tools, a data acquisition strategy, and utilize program protection activities to address the threat over the long term.  Program Protection Planning includes protection of critical program information, critical components and mission functions, and integrates high level security policies and practical expertise to specific RDA practices, systems engineering activities, and risk reduction activities.  Through this initiative the Department is maturing system security engineering methodologies to protect controlled unclassified information, to include controlled technical information on contractor networks; improve mitigation of supply chain risk management risks, improve integration of cybersecurity into the engineering processes, mature processes to identify Critical Program Information integration of defense exportability features and improve program protection planning.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>As the Department develops advanced technologies, it must use a rigorous, repeatable methodology to protect technology advantage beyond current Program Protection Planning policy. The production of Technology Area Protection Plans (TAPPs) will generate consistent and balanced protection of critical technology, provide foundational guidance for communicating about the technology to particular audiences, and inform protection and controls for the technology. This will encompass the lifecycle of basic and applied research, advanced technology development, prototyping, and technology transition to programs.  The Department will establish policy to protect critical technology in S&amp;T investments through program protection. The implementation of these policies and TAPPs will have broad impacts across DoD and interagency-wide activities associated with critical technologies, including export controls, Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) mitigations, Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) decisions, international agreements, counterintelligence and law enforcement priorities, and development of protection practices with DoD research performers (e.g., DoD and national laboratories, academia, small businesses, and the broader innovation base).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DoD established a joint analysis capability (Joint Acquisition Program and Exploitation Cell (JAPEC)) to conduct comprehensive assessments of controlled unclassified technical information losses, and engage acquisition and intelligence sources, to determine consequences and appropriate preventative/mitigation actions.  The JAPEC requires the ability to detect and characterize past technology losses, conduct damage assessments of lost information, and provide various insights with predictive value. Together with supporting organizations, the JAPEC enables comprehensive, detailed assessments of U.S. military technological vulnerability, as well as inform the development and application of effective policies, countermeasures, and enforcement actions to preserve U.S. technical superiority in all warfighting domains.

JAPEC, and supporting organizations, require an analytic capability to synchronize, integrate, coordinate and inform DoD efforts in order to protect the acquisition and investment in sensitive U.S. technologies from adversaries and better exploit opportunities to deter, deny and disrupt adversary activities. JAPEC will conduct trend analysis of protection efforts for the Department's critical acquisition programs and technologies, incorporate findings into protection processes and activities, and analyze losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action to include deterring our strategic competitors and identifying opportunities to promote our innovation base.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Innovation Base (TIB) effort develops long-term strategies and employs mechanisms to retain the U.S. advantage in current and emerging modernization technology priorities and the innovation base developing, testing, manufacturing, and sustaining them.  This project provides support to technology priority leaders in identifying innovation base needs; characterizing and assessing priority technology areas, identifying and mitigating risks impacting the innovation base, and exploiting opportunities to advance technology development, testing, and manufacturing.  One of TIB’s main objectives is to create balance between promotion of the innovation base while protecting the technology from interference or exploitation by competitors..  This balance will aid the Department’s advancing critical and emergent technologies ahead of competitor nations and actors while sustaining a healthy, resilient, and globally competitive innovation base.  This portfolio of activity extends efforts initiated in response to FY19 NDAA Section 1793.

This project uses a three-step approach: (1) Assess, (2) Protect/Promote; and (3) Monitor.  In the first step, TIB uses emerging technology assessments to translate technology requirements to manufacturing and innovation base requirements in order to identify innovation base issues, risks, and opportunities.  TIB created an assessment methodology that incorporates four types of studies to provide a full overview of the technology from a manufacturing and innovation base point of view.  The results of the assessments are used to create technology and innovation base protection and promotion strategies (second step of the approach). TIB leverages DoD and Federal Government tools and initiatives to implement the strategies.   In the third step, TIB uses data analytics to measure the success of mitigation and exploitation strategies, establish trends in the markets, and identify the need for additional assessments or changes in the strategies.  For technology protection, TIB manages the OUSD(R&amp;E) responsibilities for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews.  TIB does the initial screening of all CFIUS cases to determine R&amp;E equities and request R&amp;E subject matter experts review in foreign acquisition transactions with a potential negative impact to national security.  TIB is the focal point for all R&amp;E stakeholders and the link between the organization and the rest of the DoD stakeholders.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&amp;E)) is the principal staff advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, responsible for the research, development, and prototyping activities across the DoD enterprise. In this capacity, OUSD(R&amp;E) conducts analyses and studies; develops policies; provides technical leadership, oversight and advice; and issues guidance for Department of Defense (DoD) RDT&amp;E programs. This program element (PE) provides mission support to the Office of the USD(R&amp;E) (OUSD(R&amp;E)) covering a wide range of studies and analysis in support of the R&amp;E program and its impacts to the Department's decision to fund Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts. Such activities include: (1) identification and development of new technological opportunities; (2) insertion of new technologies into warfighting systems and operations; and (3) management and evaluation of the effectiveness of technology programs.  

The PE provides funding for the Defense Laboratory Office within the USD(R&amp;E).  The Defense Laboratory Office mission is to craft policy and provide the oversight necessary to both preserve current and develop future DoD in-house laboratory capability such that they continue to generate mission-critical innovations that increase the U.S. military advantage and enhance U.S. national security.  The Defense Laboratory Office advocates and supports the DoD laboratory system in three areas:  (1) facilities and infrastructure; (2) personnel and quality of workforce; and (3) technology transfer.

The PE provides funding for engineering, scientific, and analytical support to the USD(R&amp;E) in its responsibility for direction, overall quality, and content of the science and technology (S&amp;T) program and to ensure that the technology being developed is affordable and helps minimize system development risk.  

Beginning in FY 2021, the PE will also fund research and technical analysis and management, under the direction of the newly created Director of Defense Research and Engineering for Modernization. These investments will promote further prioritization and targeting of the Department's key investments across the modernization efforts.

Beginning in FY 2021, this PE will also fund Homeland Defense Capabilities Development Initiatives to address technology application in support of homeland defense of our military installations and the surrounding areas.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Most DoD technical information resides on unclassified networks where it is at risk of being targeted for cyber espionage campaigns. Protecting DoD unclassified controlled technical information is a high priority for the Department, and is critical to preserving intellectual property and competitive capabilities of our national industrial base. To maintain full confidence in our systems, the Department must also assess the effect the loss of this information has on our warfighting capabilities. DoD contractors who produce or access controlled technical information must incorporate security standards on their networks and report cyber-intrusion incidents that result
in the loss of this information. These requirements are important, but insufficient in the face of a determined adversary. The Department must take steps to understand the impacts of losses and rethink how we safeguard our capabilities. This information, while unclassified, includes data and intellectual property concerning defense systems requirements, concepts of operations, technologies, designs, engineering, systems production, and component manufacturing.

This project supports protection of unclassified controlled technical information, and an analysis of losses, to determine consequences and appropriate requirements, acquisition, programmatic, and strategic courses of action.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

On behalf of the OUSD(R&amp;E) this project executes the following activities:

- Support acquisition programs in the development of comprehensive, efficient, and innovative test strategies.  Ensure that developmental test strategies are documented in Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPs).  Review and approve/disapprove the DT&amp;E strategy/plans within the TEMP.
- Support rapid prototyping, rapid fielding, and technology demonstrations efforts in the development of tailored comprehensive, efficient, and innovative DT&amp;E strategies/plans.
- Review and oversee developmental test processes across the services, especially during the formative stages of programs, to include prototyping and experimentation.
- Provide DT&amp;E subject matter experts to assist programs in building Developmental Evaluation Frameworks (DEFs) for inclusion in the TEMP.
- Provide cybersecurity subject matter experts and assist programs in conducting Cybersecurity Table Top Exercises to identify potential threat vectors and associated risks early in development and focus Cybersecurity DT&amp;E efforts (In FY 2021, this effort will move to Project 048).
- For ACAT ID programs, provide independent DT&amp;E Sufficiency Assessments prior to Milestone B and C decisions with the goal of reducing discovery of performance issues later in the acquisition cycle.
- When requested by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense, provide independent developmental test assessments in support of USD(A&amp;S) and Service Major Defense Acquisition Programs.
- Support the development of independent technical risk assessments and advise the Secretary on the progress toward meeting Key Performance Parameters, technology maturation, reliability growth projections, interoperability, and cybersecurity posture before any decision to grant Milestone A or B approval, or enter into low-rate initial production or full-rate production for ACAT ID programs or when requested by the Secretary.
- Serve as the Functional Leader for the T&amp;E acquisition career field.  Support OUSD(R&amp;E) to establish, oversee, and maintain the education, training, and experience requirements including competencies and certification standards to enhance the T&amp;E acquisition workforce.  Monitor and facilitate Defense Acquisition University (DAU) updates of T&amp;E courses to ensure the curriculum supports the certification standards and provides the appropriate education and training.
- Manage the Scientific Test and Analysis Techniques Center of Excellence (STAT COE).  Over the last four years, the STAT COE has supported over 40 Acquisition Program Managers in the development of statistically optimized test programs.  These efforts have resulted in 175 more efficient and effective test plans and a test cost avoidance of about $160.000 million.
- Support OUSD(R&amp;E) to develop policy and guidance that ensures efficient and effective DT&amp;E across the DoD, including policy and guidance for developmental testing of interoperability and cybersecurity in coordination with the Joint Staff and DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO).
- Identify DoD test infrastructure gaps and support development of the OUSD(R&amp;E) test resources strategic plan.
- Ensure that the DT&amp;E activities are fully integrated into, and consistent with, the DoD Systems Engineering and development planning processes.
- Evolve the DT&amp;E 'state of practice' to keep pace with emerging technologies and improve test efficiency to field systems faster.
- Coordinate with Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to improve T&amp;E efficiency and make best use of integrated testing.
- Beginning in FY 2021, Cybersecurity efforts in this project will be moved to project 048.
- Beginning in FY 2021, USD(R&amp;E) consolidated all policy and workforce efforts under the SE Program Element 0605142D8Z.  T&amp;E Policy and Workforce efforts will be managed and funded from that PE with support from this PE.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE) by funding assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, as well as the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the National Defense Strategy. These RDT&amp;E resources support critical studies and analyses to assist senior DoD leaders in optimally balancing the lethality, partnership, and reform levels of effort to carry out the National Defense Strategy.  


This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda focuses on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense,  addressing difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance the senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.

In FY 2019 CAPE received increased funding from the DoD Joint Service Provider to support the migration, implementation, and sustainment of its DoD Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) efforts. In addition to the one-year increased RDT&amp;E funding for FY 2019 itemized in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Procurement and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding throughout the FY 2019-2023 FYDP to support the migration and sustainment of these developmental solutions. CAPE's  funds are included in the total Internet DMZ Migration amount transferred from JSP to OSD so that CAPE and three other affected OSD Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs) can execute their own long-term solutions outside of the JSP DMZ.

The FY 2021 budget proposal includes additional resources to support the Enterprise Visiability and Maintainability of Operation and Support Costs (EVAMOSC). This was a new project in FY 2020. EVAMOSC supports CAPE's responsibility to develop and maintain a database of actual operating and support (O&amp;S) costs for major weapons systems, as required in 10 USC Ch. 137, Sec. 2337a and further refined by Sec. 832 of the 2019 NDAA.  Additionally, the EVAMOSC data capability will directly support development and reporting of readiness metrics associated with implementation of the National Defense Strategy. In FY 2021 CAPE will continue to design and develop an enterprise data platform to serve as the authoritative source of Operating and Support (O&amp;S) cost data for major weapon systems.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>Outyear numbers reflect fiscal guidance, revised inflation guidance, and programmatic changes. The FY 2021 funding increase reflects direction for CAPE to continue work started in FY 2020 to develop and maintain a database of actual operating and support costs for major weapons systems, known as EVAMOSC. In addition to the RDT&amp;E funding for EVAMOSC described in this exhibit, CAPE also received additional Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding in FY 2023, FY 2024, and FY 2025 to support EVAMOSC operational efforts. These funds will enable CAPE to develop and maintain a reference database of actual operating and support (O&amp;S) costs for major weapons systems. Finally the Defense Wide Review realigned RDT&amp;E study funding to provide additional resources directly to CAPE for budget and program assessments.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program supports the Office of the Director, Cost Assessment &amp; Program Evaluation (CAPE).  It funds assessments that help to resolve budget and programmatic issues across the full range of the Department’s activities.  Projects that support this effort help to inform the leadership on program alternatives, capability concept development, design and cost, the appropriate balance of capabilities across the force, and also to identify how well the Department’s expenditures are meeting its goals, and how well the force can implement the Defense strategy.

This program provides for analytical research across the entire spectrum of  defense issues and concerns.  The research agenda focuses on near to long-term problems identified by the Secretary of Defense, and addresses difficult and complex questions linked to program alternatives for current and future capabilities and forces in order to enhance DoD senior leadership's deliberations and decision-making.

This program provides the scientific and technical engineering services needed for research studies in the development of models and simulations and the evaluation of current analytical tools and scientific methods used to evaluate and assess weapons systems and warfighting capabilities for warfighting environments and scenarios, and related force structure.  Deliverables from this program will include reports, briefings, and analyses designed to illuminate critical issues facing the Department.  Outcomes include recommendations for new modeling techniques, programmatic alternatives, and scenario development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Investments support DoD's current and emerging OPSEC capability gaps, including countering advances in non-U.S. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and denying the understanding of U.S. capability, capacity, readiness and critical technology and information from adversaries. These investments spur Department innovation and preserve U.S. technology superiority. DOSI Analysis and Engineering Studies lead the community's ability to sustain and maximize technology advantage as they are transitioned to Service and Agency programs for sustainment, maintenance, and capacity programming.

Project Maven uses Rapid prototype sprints to field increasing amounts of automation to FMV ground exploitation stations for TUAVs, Medium Altitude and High Altitude ISR platforms. Maven uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon). This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven develops algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW builds capabilities,  integrate AI and machine learning (ML) to provide actionable intelligence and enhance military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team (AWCFT) funds Project Maven, a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) for Full Motion Video (FMV) Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer/near peer competitor strategy. Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:Description>

                                        <r2:Text>Project Maven uses rapid prototype sprints to field increasing amounts of automation to FMV ground exploitation stations for TUAVs, Medium Altitude, High Altitude and WAMI ISR platforms and accelerate the development and deployment of AI capabilities across the Defense Intelligence Enterprise, including exploitation of CEM, ACINT,OPIR and PAI exploitation Maven will continue to use artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. This initiative brings artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision into the process of object detection, identification, and tracking at computer process speed versus human speed. Incorporating computer vision and algorithms will reduce the human burden and provide efficient and effective exploration of data. Project Maven plans to develop algorithms focused on tactical UAV FMV Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and an operational PED environment for platforms and ground stations. AW will build capabilities, integrate AI and ML to provide actionable intelligence and enhancement to military decision-making by providing algorithms for object detection, classification and user alerts.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The IBAS mission is to strengthen the posture and readiness of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will to national security needs.  Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) Support was established in accordance with 10 USC Sec 2508 Industrial Base Fund direction to strengthen the posture of the U.S. Defense Manufacturing and Industrial Base to respond at will in support of the Warfighter today and tomorrow.  The IBAS Program provides the Department with a unique capability to achieve the strategic aims of the 2018 National Defense Strategy calling for a strong, resilient, responsive and healthy U.S. Industrial Base (IB) that underpins current and future U.S. force readiness.  This program is uniquely positioned to improve the U.S. Industrial Base’s competitiveness and ability to respond to the Department’s needs by applying focused investments to 1) monitor and assess the current state of the IB, 2) address critical issues in the IB relating to Urgent Operational Needs, 3) address supply chain vulnerabilities, and 4) support efforts to expand the Industrial Base.

Manufacturing dominance underpins technical dominance. IBAS is fundamental to achieving a modern IB that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to be able to respond at will to National Security Requirements. A healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains are essential to the economic strength and national security of the United States.  The ability of the United States to maintain readiness, and to surge and sustain in response to an emergency, directly relates to the capacity, capabilities, and resiliency of our manufacturing and defense industrial base and supply chains. 
 
IBAS investments focus on addressing Industrial Base issues that support defense needs by identifying and closing gaps in defense manufacturing capabilities and creating and sustaining reliable sources. Key areas of IBAS investment will include:1) Continue advancement and sustainment of both traditional and emerging defense manufacturing sectors; 2) Continue preservation of critical and unique manufacturing and design skills; 3) Continue the support and expansion of reliable sources; and 4) Continue Identification and mitigation of supply chain vulnerabilities

The IBAS program has a multi-pronged approach to identify projects: 1) assessments of the national technology and industrial base by the OUSD Acquisition &amp; Sustainment (A&amp;S), Office of Industrial Policy (INDPOL) as directed by 10 U.S. Code 2505, 2) working directly in partnership with defense programs, and 3) working directly with industry. INDPOL collaborates with the services and agencies in performing assessments under the Title 10 USC Section 2505 program to identify elements of the industrial base critical to a healthy and resilient defense industrial base in order to address:  1) Gaps in national-security-related domestic manufacturing capabilities;  2) Threatened, single, or sole source capabilities especially within the lower tiers;  3) Foreign Dependency from high risk sources or countries; and  4) Education and manufacturing workforce skills needs

FY 2020 and beyond investment strategies will also be informed by findings from 1) Executive Order (EO) 13806 report, "Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States" and 2) follow-on industrial base and technology assessments. The EO assessment identified nearly 300 risks across 16 sectors; concludes the current state and trajectory of the U.S. industrial base and our capacity to support readiness is in question; and requires significant changes including increased investment for the industrial base.

Cornerstone Other Transaction Agreement (OTA): Enhanced efficiency of IBAS program execution will be supported by a new non-Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) OTA procurement vehicle called Cornerstone, established in February 2018 in partnership between the Office of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense ODASD (Industrial Policy) and the Army Futures Command, Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Chemical Biological Center (CBC). Cornerstone was specifically designed for industrial base investments to meet the Departments needs to improve readiness and sustainment through proactive engagement and investment within and across supply chains. Cornerstone provides the ability to access 19 different industry sectors under one agreement where all parties have agreed to one common management agreement and one intellectual property agreement, and it allows the Government to open or direct solicit tasks as legally appropriate against OTA statues. Cornerstone’s period of performance is “in perpetuity” with no overall ceiling, with task award ceilings. IBAS authorities coupled with Cornerstone enable the department to efficiently execute IBAS investments – positioning the industrial base to modernize at pace with our military.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>FOCUS: Entrants into the technical skills lag both commercial and defense requirements.  Lack of awareness and prestige of the career opportunities stifled potential candidates from entering. Surging defense production budgets concurrent with rising U.S. manufacturing are placing significant pressures on states and companies to increase entrants and accelerate development.  Specialty defense skills such as those related to ship construction and precision optics are highly constrained.  The focus in FY 2019 is to coalesce past and ongoing workforce development efforts for engineering and trade skills into a structured framework to elevate the prestige of and need for the technical skills; accelerate entrants into the technical skills, and comprehensively accelerate training for the technical skills. . This FY 2019 initiative shall coalesce prior projects, Manufacturing Skills Challenge and ELEV8 Supply Chain Resiliency, and expand into precision optics and additional shipyard trade skills, into an industrial base enterprise level.

Specific Efforts:
Manufacturing Skills Challenge (MSC). This effort was initiated in prior years, and continues into FY 2020. MSC project description is addressed below for FY 2020 Plans.</r2:Text>

                                        <r2:Text>1) Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Mitigation:
1a) Manufacturing Skills Challenge (MSC):  This effort across multiple fiscal years starting in FY 2017 is a collaboration among OSD, industry and academia (Universities and Community Colleges). Similar to broad-based Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) efforts, MSC is comprised of an expanding set of competitions that will help prototype longer-term development of manufacturing training and education models that: 1) promote the prestige of manufacturing and inspire individuals, 2) can be regionally and nationally integrated, 3) close critical gaps in industrial capabilities, and 4) ultimately increase industrial base and defense readiness.  The efforts funded with FY 2017, FY 2018 and FY 2020 resources focused on the welding, metrology, machining workforce in regional corridors with defense supply chains including Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee where large ship, aerospace, and automotive growth have created serious workforce skills and supply chain challenges. This effort includes competitions with "support for a prize.” FY 2020 focused on completing state- and invitational-level competitions, hosting four regional competitions, and concluding with a national championship.

2) Radars, Sensors and Electronics Sector:
2a) Radar Affordability: This is a continuing multi-year effort started in 2016. FY 2020 focuses on harmonizing cross-service system requirements and creating detailed system engineering models within the open and modular architectures to enable the DoD to leverage small to medium size companies in defense and in adjacent industrial markets to improve overall DoD radar supplier resiliency. 

2b) Unmanned Systems Affordability :  Continues effort initiated in FY 2018. Establish efforts that will develop and assure open and modular product architectures for Radio Frequency (RF), Electro-Optic (EO), and Infrared (IR) sensors, and for power and electric propulsion systems in UAS systems/platforms.  
 
2c) Directed Energy (DE) Supply Chain Assurance: Continued efforts initiated in FY 2018. Convene cross-service working group to identify supply chain requirements for meeting service program milestone requirements, assessing and prioritizing risks for mitigation strategies. 

3) Materials Sector
3a) Boron Carbide: Continue efforts initiated in FY 2019 to: 1) develop a United States (U.S.) source; 2) qualify the U.S. B4C material into a program of record (body armor); 3) develop a second U.S. source to provide competition and surge capability; and 4) to begin systematically qualifying both U.S. sources across multiple systems.

3b) Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE) Supply Chain Resiliency. Continue efforts initiated in FY 2019 as an emergent requirement, not addressed in PB 2020. Executive Orders (E.O.) 13806 and 13817 identified critical materials such as rare earths and components reliant upon rare earths as potential strategic vulnerabilities to the DoD and U.S. Commercial industrial bases. Currently, China has a near global monopoly on rare earths. This initiative is a critical element within the DoD’s broader rare earths supply chain risk mitigation plan. It aligns with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials and OSD assessment on HREE. The overall strategy is a systems engineering approach to systematically identify and mitigate risks within the rare earth supply chain and further develop domestic HREE manufacturing processes, ensuring critical component availability and continuity across the material lifecycle. FY2020 assessed Phase 0 studies for viability of domestic capability.  

4) Munitions Sector
4a) Fuze Initiatives:  Continues program management and oversight of Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD) multi-year efforts initiated in FY 2015 and still in FY 2019 contract execution to mitigate a supply chain loss caused by a reduction in non-DoD demand.</r2:Text>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Increase from FY 2020 to FY 2021 is the result of redistribution of funding from Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems: Advanced Technology Development (PE# 0303310D8Z) to CWMD Systems: System Development and Demonstration (PE# 0305310D8Z) and CWMD Systems: Operational Systems Development (PE# 0607310D8Z). This redistribution supports the Department’s need to prioritize investment in fieldable capabilities to enhance Joint Force lethality in countering WMD proliferation and use.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems portfolio aligns with the National Defense Strategy objective of “dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction.”
 
The CWMD Systems portfolio enhances warfighter lethality by developing capabilities to analyze and exploit critical nodes of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and ballistic missile programs and proliferation networks; and developing offensively-oriented capabilities to disrupt WMD proliferation networks and detect, disable, or defeat WMD and delivery systems. Investments result on capabilities fielded to the Joint Force, enabling it to reduce WMD threats and create options for the United States to prevent WMD use.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense uses the CWMD Systems portfolio to invest strategically in projects across the Military Services, Combatant Commands, and Defense Agencies. Funding is prioritized for projects that close Joint Force warfighter capability gaps. An annual investment strategy is used to meet emergent operational and capability needs submitted by the Joint Force, yielding new fielded capabilities within one to two years.

The CWMD Systems: Operational Systems Development program invests in upgrades of and enhancements to fielded systems that counter WMD proliferation. Funds are used for integration of operational prototypes into fielded systems, or other upgrades and enhancements, including any necessary test and evaluation. Investments modernize existing counter WMD capabilities within the Department of Defense to enhance the Joint Force’s lethality by upgrading and enhancing currently fielded systems. Upgraded capabilities illuminate WMD networks; exploit vulnerabilities in networks, programs, facilities, and weapons systems; and disable or defeat WMD. 

This appropriation funds labor, materials, and travel to support the requirements of this program, performed by a government agency or by private individuals or organizations under a contract with the government, for activities and acquisitions including RDT&amp;E, assessments and analyses, research studies, education, and other activities related to capability development and fielding.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Threat Reduction and Arms Control (TRAC) establishes annual priorities based on national and DoD strategies and senior leader guidance. Based on those priorities, TRAC solicits project proposals from Combatant Commands, Military Services, and Defense Agencies, and interagency partners. To be selected, a proposed project must have a validated requirement, an engaged requirement champion, a viable acquisition strategy, and a qualified program management office. A technology project must identify its starting and desired end-state Technology Readiness Level. Likewise, the end-user for any proposed project must demonstrate a long-term plan for acceptance and sustainment of a fieldable capability. Project period of performance is typically 12-18 months.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DoD CIO Information Systems Security Program (ISSP) provides for focused research, development, testing and integration of technology and technical solutions critical to the Defense Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CS&amp;IA) Program to meet the requirements of 10 USC 2224 (Defense Information Assurance Program), 44 USC 3544, (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002), OMB Circular A-130, and DoD Directives/Instructions 8500, 8510, 8520, 8530, and 8540.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because it integrates technology and technical solutions to the Defense CS&amp;IA Program.

ISSP RDT&amp;E funds support the DoD CIO and its mission partners: on architecting, engineering, and technical matters for developing governance processes and structures; on evolving and enabling a more integrated and synchronized Joint Information Environment (JIE) to provide the means for more integrated information sharing and collaboration that also endeavors to close identified gaps across all mission areas with a shared network of core enterprise services; on the continued development of the U.S. Government’s ability to prevent and defend against adversarial and/or commercial information and communications technology supply-chain attacks on its mission critical systems, networks, and devices; on improving oversight of the life-cycle management of cybersecurity risks; and on the integration of cybersecurity standards, methods, and procedures across the DoD for a more robust and resilient cybersecurity posture.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>•	Support analyses on various aspects of cybersecurity for cloud-based computing for the DoD, analyses and refinement of applicable risk factors, and continual refinement of mitigation controls as part of the risk management framework regime in support of DoD CIO’s goal of accelerating the adoption of cloud computing within the department.  Robust and comprehensive Cloud Risk Management will assist the DoD community b addressing security requirements for systems transitioning to the commercial cloud.
•	Continued support for the DoD Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP), providing resourcing for scholarships for current students and recruitment of new students

•	Continue refinement and integration of policies with the risk management framework (RMF), supportive standards, guidance, efficiency in application of controls, and web-based processes to strengthen controls and protections for information systems.

•	Continue to improve mission assurance, mitigation analyses, and vulnerability detection (hardware and software testing) for acquisitions to build-in cybersecurity early (i.e., cybersecurity built in vice bolted on), especially key acquisition programs-of-record (i.e., Major Automated Information Systems; Major Defense Acquisition Programs, and other special interest developmental and acquisition activities). Investments include Program Protection, Systems Engineering, and Acquisition standards.

•	Continue to develop and refine policies to support strategies for acquisition program protection and oversight.  Develop strategies, standards, and tools to address supply chain risk management, and continue to collaborate with private industry for commercially acceptable global sourcing and supply chain standards. 

•	Continue to evaluate cyber activities for more efficient mitigation investment decisions, to include metrics focused on the cybersecurity domain, and support for policy development and refinement, policy oversight and formulation of programmatic advice, and participation in various collaborative advisory and governance bodies. 

•	Continue development and engineering support for critical Joint Information architectures, C4I tactical networks, coalition, and mission partner’s networks.  Support includes implementing the joint information environment single security architecture and strategy, related metrics, analyses, Joint Information Environment Single Security Architecture (SSA) policies, architectures, and capabilities to ensure best value architectural decisions are made early to affect the most impact, while increasing mission and security for the entire DoD enterprise.

•	Continue to develop and implement strategies for successful defenses and operations in the event of sophisticated cyber adversaries and large-scale cyber incidents, to include threat-based system-security-engineering efforts and development of critical design artifacts (threat analyses, risk analyses, system-of- system-security architectures), having demonstrated applications to space systems and mission partner environment (MPE).

•	Continue to develop, publish, and refine DoD mobility strategy, processes for use of commercial Cloud providers, Cloud security guidance and procedures for use by potential commercial Cloud service providers, and continued oversight of policies and capabilities to support comprehensive cybersecurity capability for the Joint Information Environment (JIE).</r2:Text>

                                <r2:Description>Request supports the Long Term Competitions (LTC) program which is an analytical effort chartered to provide the DoD senior leadership with an understanding of key long-term developments and dynamics in specific areas of the global security environment, and to develop competitive strategies for their consideration as the Department seeks to address these long term challenges.  The LTC Program will provide rigorously analyzed competitive strategy recommendations to these senior DoD leaders, and will require the support of organizations and experts outside of government to deliver the highest quality analysis, concepts and recommendations.  Funding for the LTC program will be used to: bring outside experts into Task Force working groups and strategy review teams; contract studies; support wargaming and workshops; conduct analytical studies of key developments and dynamics, and their impact on the future security environment and U.S. military capabilities in that environment; and explore new approaches to addressing key analytical requirements.
Assessments of the ability of future forces to achieve objectives at the campaign level. These assessments include wargaming, qualitative, and quantitative analytic methods. They will both inform and be informed by the Support for Strategic Analysis (SSA) defense planning scenarios (DPS). They will identify risk and potential trade-space among force structure, capabilities, and readiness to inform senior leader decision-making.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funds will be used to provide technical analysis, systems engineering and capability management oversight of programs, projects, initiatives and activities to maximize the Department’s return on investment in information technology resources and affect a comprehensive approach for assessing and procuring critical information systems from initial design, through development to capability delivery in support of improved systems performance and military operations. Emphasis is placed on the information transport, information assurance/cyber security, network and spectrum management, command and control (C2) applications, systems and services, information sharing capabilities, commercial mobile devices (CMD), applications and infrastructure, and enterprise services activities focused on the development, integration, testing and technical assessment of capabilities and applications in joint and coalition warfighter support environments.  Resources support collaborative efforts to demonstrate the interoperability and performance requirements of command, control, and communications (C3) capabilities and programs.  This program is funded under Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development.

     This project provides the resources necessary to implement net centric processes and authoritative analytic methods that provide the capability to synchronize interdependent C3 capabilities across all layers (ground, air, space, maritime, cyberspace) of the joint information environment (JIE), to forecast and achieve a balance in supply and demand for network capacity, and field effective capabilities more rapidly and efficiently as an enabler for C3 capabilities applications and services.  Resources are required to transform current networks and information infrastructure into an operationally unified and architecturally diverse and secure joint information environment that will provide end-to-end communications transport layer, computing networks, and mission application capabilities that are optimized and integrated with all other joint capability areas with a focus on the tactical edge faced with disconnected, intermittent, and latency (DIL) environments.  There will be technical assessments, modeling and simulation, and analysis of the Joint space communications layer, Joint aerial network layer, contested communications on the move, Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), C2 mission applications, commercial mobile devices, and information sharing capabilities.  These funds provide the capability for the warfighter to manage and deconflict radio frequencies through ground, air, and space communication networks.  The funds will be used to develop and synchronize information assurance and mission assurance capabilities with other joint information environment capabilities to provide secure access to information and services (e.g. Cryptographic Modernization Management plan).

     In addition, funding will continue to be used to support the Defense Information System's Agency's (DISA) and Services' interoperable improvement efforts and processes in the development of common standards and protocols.  This effort includes the Joint Interoperability Enhancement Process (IEP) that allows operators, engineers, and program managers to verify capabilities and identify issues in a design with Joint /Allied units prior to system fielding, or with fielded systems to identify required systems changes for systems upgrade planning.  DISA and the Joint Forces Combatant Command lead the effort to transform the current standards and interoperability management tools to a common set of Joint network-enabled standards to ensure adherence to the DoD Information Network (DODIN) enterprise-wide technical baseline and for implementation of future Tactical Data Link (TDL) capabilities. These joint standards, protocols, and processes will be used for implementation and testing to ensure the TDL capabilities are synchronized with the development and integration timelines of other planned network-enabled DODIN initiatives.  The threats to the networking waveforms and the Joint NC migration will also be looked at in cooperation with the Intelligence agencies.  In support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), rebuilding the warfighting readiness of the Joint Force (Lethality); Net Centricity improves strategic and tactical C2 and Communications, CIO is actively supporting the services to accelerate modernization of Command and Control and Communication (C3) systems.  As outlined in the NDS, the return of great power competition elevates the requirement for the Joint Force to dominate a highly contested conflict.  DoD cannot assume the same robust, uninterrupted, tactical-to-strategic command and control network will remain intact against a peer-level adversary.  Rather than existing across a single domain, these new network paths must leverage space, air, land, surface, sub-surface, and cyber to ensure redundancy against attack.  To build confidence in our communication ability in a contested theater, DoD must make targeted investments that increase communication resiliency.  This resilient architecture leverages multiple waveforms carried across space, air, land, surface, sub-surface and cyber minimizes periods that C2 will be degraded when communicating in a highly contested environment.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The AV investment funds an agile software pilot to deliver and sustain the Department’s authoritative acquisition data through NIPR and SIPR instances of the Defense Acquisition Visibility Environment (DAVE), provide data access and standards via the Acquisition Visibility Data Matrix (AVDM), and accelerate the retirement of costly legacy systems. AV is the sole authoritative source for acquisition data inside the DoD and for the Congress, GAO, and the Inspectors General for multiple Acquisition Pathways including all Acquisition Category (ACAT) I – IV MDAP programs, Middle Tier of Acquisition programs, and National Command, Control, and Communications programs. It provides acquisition data for Comptroller’s ADVANA, Air Force and Army PMRT, Navy RDAIS, and EVM- CR.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Provides for agile development, test and evaluation, procurement, production and modification, and the operation and maintenance of Software and Digital Technology Pilot Programs.  Characteristics of this budget activity include software, and electronic tools, systems, applications, resources, acquisition of services, business process re-engineering activities, functional requirements development, technical evaluations, and other activities in direct support of acquiring, developing, deploying, sustaining, enhancing, and modernizing Software and Digital Technology Pilot Programs. AWCFT funds Project Maven, a rapid fielding Artificial Intelligence (AI) program to augment and automate Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) for Full Motion Video (FMV) Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (TUAVs), Medium Altitude, High Altitude, and Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in support of defeat-ISIS and National Defense Strategy (NDS) peer/near peer competitor strategy. Project Maven also brings AI to Captured Enemy Material (CEM), Acoustical Intelligence (ACINT), Overhead Persistent Infrared program (OPIR) and Public Available Information (PAI) exploitation. Project Maven uses AI, deep learning, and computer vision algorithms to detect, classify, and track objects within FMV images (e.g., person, vehicle, and weapon) and other AI algorithms for CEM and text based projects. Maven algorithms increase the intelligence value of ISR, reduce the human burden of screening so analysts can multi-task increasing productivity, and seeds the generation of insight from Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). Project Maven is a commercial technology initiative that inserts commercial AI into existing programs of records. Most military intelligence exploitation systems were designed pre-AI and require specialized integration to enable the insertion of algorithms into their software baseline. Project Maven is the pathfinder AI initiative for the DoD and is investing in critical AI architecture to support the rapid expansion of AI to other mission areas besides GEOINT. As Project Maven algorithms increase in capability, the algorithms will move to the edge (on the sensor platform).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                        <r2:Text>Project Maven’s FMV Sprint 2 capability is now deployed to 40 sites within the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force (TUAV and Medium Altitude MQ1-C and MQ9) automatically detecting and geo-locating people, vehicles and buildings, tracking objects in motion, and capturing training data for continued algorithm improvements.  Project Maven started by bringing AI to the FMV COIN fight to improve the speed and accuracy of analysis and reduce the manpower burden of video exploitation.  The investments in AI for FMV COIN are being leveraged for high end warfare to detect conventional military equipment such as tanks, artillery, airplanes and missile launchers.  Project Maven FMV algorithms will be deployed to Air Force and Army units and additional OCONUS sites.</r2:Text>

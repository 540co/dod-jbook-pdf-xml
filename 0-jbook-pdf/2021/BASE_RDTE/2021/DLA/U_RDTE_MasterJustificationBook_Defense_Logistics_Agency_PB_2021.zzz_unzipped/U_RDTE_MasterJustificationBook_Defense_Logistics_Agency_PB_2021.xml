                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) Program funds the advanced technology development needed to achieve a responsive, efficient domestic industrial base that meets the warfighters' needs in an affordable and timely manner.  The ManTech program works with DLA’s diverse supply chains to improve manufacturing capability throughout a product's life cycle.  It provides the crucial link between invention and application by maturing, scaling up, and validating advanced manufacturing technology in “real world” environments.  ManTech developments provide a path to low-risk technology implementation for many small businesses and defense unique suppliers as well as depots and shipyards that are critical to DLA.  By anticipating and addressing production and sustainment problems before they occur, readiness levels increase and sustainment costs are lower.  

DLA ManTech is aligned into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFA): 1) Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes (IIBM); 2) Maintaining Viable Sources of Supply (MVSS); and 3) Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI).  

• The IIBM SFA includes efforts to reduce industrial base material costs and production lead-times, while improving the quality of DLA managed products.  This SFA has supply chain focused execution portfolios for food (Subsistence Network), Castings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Advanced Casting Technology), Forgings (Procurement Readiness Optimization—Forging Advance System Technology), Batteries (Battery Network) and Additive Manufacturing.

• MVSS includes efforts to assure the commercial industrial base can satisfy DLA materiel requirements without relying on foreign sources for microcircuits.  This strategic focus area mitigates supply issues caused by the lack of a reliable domestic manufacturing capability to produce products or raw materials needed to build and maintain weapon systems.  The major focus of the program is maintaining a reliable, trusted, domestic source for “non-procurable” linear and digital microcircuits.  Microcircuit emulation allows the Services to save significant costs by using form, fit and functionally equivalent spare parts rather than redesigning the next-higher-assembly.

• The ITLI SFA includes efforts to improve and facilitate the exchange of engineering and logistics information among DLA, the Military Services, DLA industry partners and DLA customers.  It includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) and the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) programs.  A primary focus of this SFA is to capitalize on the emerging “Model Based Enterprise” paradigm and the semantic web as an enabler to a logistics system that is smart and connected up and down the supply chain and across all DLA Customers and suppliers.  A major focus is to transform DoD engineering data from two-dimensional paper-based products to three-dimensional computer based models, and to develop processes to move from “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF files) to technical data files that can interface directly with industries’ engineering systems. The benefits include shorter product introduction cycles, lower set up-costs for parts production and more economical small batch production.

DLA’s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency’s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support.  This effort spans across both DLA R&amp;D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Industrial Base Manufacturing Processes Strategic Focus Area (SFA) is an R&amp;D effort undertaken with DLA’s suppliers to reduce material costs, reduce the length and variability of production lead-times, assure DLA managed products meet performance requirements, and continuously improve quality and reliability.  Benefits of this SFA include lower material costs, lower inventory levels and more predictable customer wait times, fewer quality deficiencies, and lower customer support costs.  This SFA includes within its scope the Subsistence Network, the Battery Network, the Castings/Forging programs and Additive Manufacturing programs. 

The Subsistence Network (SUBNET) program is the successor to the Combat Rations Network R&amp;D program. SUBNET focuses on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain.  The program's expanded areas of interest include: combat rations, food equipment, field feeding solutions, food footprint, food innovations, food safety and defense developments, garrison feeding, nutrition and health, storage and packing solutions, surge and sustainment support, and water security.  SUBNET forms a community of practice with Military Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center; Academia, and Industry to research and promote manufacturing improvements in the Subsistence Supply Chain with the goals of maximizing capability and capacity to produce, and to encourage innovation and modernization needed to leverage the latest technologies.  Desired outcomes include: reduced cost, increased efficiencies, improved processes, enhanced quality, and improved surge demand capabilities.

The Casting program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic casting industrial base supporting the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The casting program works with industry, universities, and the Casting Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s foundry industry.  The program aligns projects with strategic issues and identified focus areas within the DLA and DoD. Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the casting industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain castings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Cast parts are ~2% of National Stock Numbered Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are castings.  This program includes tasks that focus on developing new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed, these capabilities will support the foundry industry, where the technologies will be tested and implemented, most often in conjunction with the casting industry associations.  These advancements improve the metal casting supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of castings critical to DoD weapon systems.

The Forging program works to ensure a stable, reliable, and competitive domestic forging industrial base for the weapon system needs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Working with industry, universities, and the Forging Industry Associations to identify projects that improve the materials, processes and business practices of the nation’s forging industry.  The program aligns its projects with strategic issues and focus areas identified within the DLA and DoD.  Guidance for these projects comes from the DLA Strategic Plan and input from the forging industry.  Weapon system spare parts managed by DLA that contain Forgings are responsible for a disproportionate share of DLA’s backorders or unfilled orders (UFOs).  Forged parts are ~2% of National Stock Number (NSN) Class IX parts but represent ~5% of all backorders, and when only the oldest backorders are considered, up to 10% are forgings.  This program includes tasks to develop new capabilities in the areas of inspection, materials, processes, modeling, and design. Once developed these capabilities will support the forging industry, where these technologies will be tested and implemented in conjunction with the forging industry associations.  These advancements improve the forging supply chains for the DoD and the DLA to better support the warfighter.  We will invest in projects aimed at reducing lead-time, reducing cost, and improving quality of forgings critical to DoD weapon systems.

The Battery Network (BATTNET) program objective is to develop the next generation of battery manufacturing technologies for cost and price efficiency, longer shelf life, and lighter batteries with higher energy.  BATTNET conducts R&amp;D initiatives to address sustainment gaps and bridge technical solutions into higher a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) for specific groups of batteries.  BATTNET also focuses on projects to develop the production capability for advanced lithium-based non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries to ensure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of Service approved batteries.  Desired outcomes include: streamlined inventory and associated cost reductions through standardization and improved distribution practices; resolved obsolescence issues; addressed surge and sustainment issues; enhanced security of supply chain; increased competition and manufacturing base; reduced per unit battery cost; and leveraged Service-level (Army, Navy, Air Force) and other governmental (DOE, DOT, NASA) R&amp;D efforts to insert new technology and practices into the existing DLA battery inventory.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program objective is to establish AM as an effective alternative to conventional manufacturing and document the process for AM benefits.  DLA is pursing all AM technology as a lead-time and inventory reduction enabler.  The AM effort pursues alternate means of supply for products that are otherwise non-procurable or susceptible to procurement issues due to an unresponsive manufacturing vendor base.  The AM effort includes the identification of AM candidates among the population of products that are needed but hard to obtain, costly or have long manufacturing lead times.  The AM effort requires management of 3D digital technical and manufacturing data. In addition, the AM effort includes the development of the processes that will tie the designers, engineers, maintainers, logisticians, procurement managers and the vendor base into a seamless AM procurement stream. Potential benefits include products that can address an unfulfilled Warfighter readiness need by reducing production lead times, production costs, storage costs, transportation costs and in some cases fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options. DLA R&amp;D will leverage these efforts with Industry, Academia and ongoing Military Service-level agreements (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Department of Energy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

SUBNET will attend subsistence trade and industry events to leverage technology innovations and promote manufacturing improvements. The program will also pursue Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topics in Subsistence.  The SUBNET program will work with community partners (military services, industry, and academia) to leverage the latest technologies, encourage innovation and modernization, and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program also plans to collaborate with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on their future projects for synergy and also incorporating them as a potential transition partner.

The Casting program plans to research, develop and deploy innovative and technical solutions to ensure a viable and competitive domestic industrial base for the DoD and DLA in support of the needs of the warfighter. The program uses competitively awarded contracts to fulfill these requirements; projects are required to include a business case with specific metrics and a transition plan for success. The Casting program works with industry, academia, and the leading Industry Associations to identify improvements to materials, processes, and business practices of the nation’s metal casting industry. The Casting program will continue the execution and monitoring of projects approved and awarded in prior years while maintaining focus on future development and needs. 

The Forging program will investigate, develop and deploy innovative enterprise and technical solutions to strengthen the forging supply chain and the forging industry. The program will explore alternative forging manufacturing methods, materials and modeling to reduce production lead-time and costs. Enhancements to modeling and simulation software coupled with forging process and post-processing improvements are some projects that align the forging program with fulfilling the needs of the warfighter. The Forging program will, with a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), solicit industry, academia, and industry associations for new projects in alignment with the strategic focus and future needs of the DoD and DLA. 

The Battery Network (BATTNET) program will initiate new projects for improving the production readiness, transition, and standardization of soldier and system batteries within the DLA supply chain.

The program will continue addressing additional requirements for manufacturing and material improvements in the vacuum electron tube supply base.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program plans to fund technically proficient efforts that accelerate the rapid qualification and certification methodologies for AM items, identify the best AM applications for castings and forging preforms, achieve precise repeatability of part fabrication using an AM technical data package at simultaneous geographic points of need and prove the delivery of AM parts to warfighters deployed at expeditionary sea, land or air bases. Using market research, requests for information/proposals, BAA, DLA R&amp;D will identify the best courses of action to negotiate technical, testing and intellectual property data for AM fabrication to keep these items competitive. The DLA R&amp;D efforts include the proof of concept of using digital thread methodologies to effectively manage manufacturing data and maintain a consistent AM product from design through qualification and acceptance. Collaboration will continue with the Military Service Engineering Support Activities (via Service-level agreements with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force) and the Department of Energy by providing funding for AM work identified under the respective agreements. The partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) will allow further options with the Big Area AM (BAAM) family of parts. DLA will leverage Military Services and Industry collaboration to develop digital verification and validation (including measures of effectiveness and key performance parameters) of AM technical data and first article testing for polymers and metals, and critical and non-critical items. These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options.</r2:Text>

The BAA will solicit projects from industry to improve the materials and processes used within the forging industry.  Contract awards are anticipated during the fiscal year.

The Battery Network (BATTNET) program will initiate new projects for improving the production readiness, transition, and standardization of soldier and system batteries within the DLA supply chain.  Areas of focus will be for critical non-rechargeable soldier batteries, bipolar lead-acid battery capabilities, and lithium-ion formats for aviation batteries.  The program will also continue addressing requirements for manufacturing and material improvements in the low power, vacuum electron tube supply base.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program plans to finance collaborative technical efforts from the military departments, industry, and academic institutions that have the potential to accelerate the qualification, certification and fabrication methodologies for AM applications and create sources of AM supplies or services for DLA.  DLA R&amp;D will support DOD-wide efforts to baseline risk categorization of AM parts and acceptability criteria that will accelerate AM integration into the DOD Supply Chain.  DLA R&amp;D will fund efforts to identify the best methods for converting models and technical drawings that predate Computer-Aided Design and Drafting software into digital format in order to expedite creation of digital models and related design and testing information to help establish and expand the DoD digital library of AM parts to solve issues with obsolescence, low volume, long-lead, costly parts.  These efforts seek to increase the number of AM parts qualified for procurement and achieve savings from the associated lead-time, storage costs, transportation costs, in some cases reduction of fuel consumption due to lighter design and material options.  Desired outcomes include: exploration of improved reverse engineering processes for AM purposes, and optimization of polymer and metal AM production to obtain land, air and sea and expeditionary platform spare parts. Overall DLA Enterprise AM efforts will provide alternatives in product realization in order to address unfulfilled Warfighter readiness needs.</r2:Text>

SUBNET will work with community partners (military services, industry, and academia) to leverage the latest innovations. SUBNET plans to research and execute projects in FY2021 regarding mobile distribution facilities around the battlefield, modernization of government subsistence warehouses, assessment of materiel handling capabilities, and integrating robotics into current processes.  The program will also continue to pursue Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topics in Subsistence, and collaborate with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on their future projects for synergy and as a potential transition partner.

The Casting program will on continue to monitor awarded contracts for projects that research, develop and deploy innovative and technical solutions to ensure a viable and competitive domestic industrial base.  These projects focus on improving manufacturing processes and technology that includes robotic and additive manufacturing methods and implementation, new test processes and procedures to evaluate cast materials, computer simulation and modeling to decrease lead-time and increase quality.  The Casting program works with Academia, industry, and industry associations to continually identify future development and technical needs in alignment with the DoD and DLA. 

The Forging program will monitor contracts awarded under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) offered in FY20 and award any remaining proposed projects that could be funded.  The projects included in the contracts will focus on exploring alternative forging manufacturing methods, materials to reduce production lead-time and costs, modeling and simulation software improvements and enhancements and improvements to post processing methods.  These projects will be in alignment with the needs of the DoD and DLA aimed and supporting and fulfilling the needs of the warfighter. Forgings baseline was reduced by approximately $0.500 million resulting from overall MANTECH $3.020 million in directed reductions. Impact of the baseline reduction will cause project cancellation or delays in the Forgings program.

The Battery Network (BATTNET) program will continue new projects for improving the production readiness, transition, and standardization of soldier and system batteries within the DLA supply chain.  The BATTNET program will also leverage new battery manufacturing technologies for the supply chain that have been developed by industry – advanced electrode production, low cost materials production or recycling, advanced performance cells, and deep-discharge lithium-ion capabilities. BATTNET baseline was reduced by approximately $0.500 million resulting from overall MANTECH $3.020 million in directed reductions. Impact of the baseline reduction will cause project cancellation or delays for improvements to warfighter weapon system battery performance and cost.

The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program, using market research, requests for information/proposals, Broad Agency Announcements (BAA), DLA R&amp;D will fund analysis of alternatives for the best cognitive computing solutions to integrate information from several logistics, engineering, legal, and supplier data sources into an efficient AM decisional framework.  These augmented analytics efforts will help identify unseen patterns in the utilization of AM resources such as machines, materials, manufacturing expertise, and manufacturing data to shape an efficient AM distributive manufacturing ecosystem.  Desired outcomes include: optimization of polymer and metal AM production to obtain land, air and sea and expeditionary platform spare parts. The Additive Manufacturing (AM) program plans to finance collaborative technical efforts from the military departments, industry, and academic institutions that enhance the customer engagement with the AM product management workflows.  Overall DLA Enterprise AM efforts will identify the best AM applications to achieve precise robustness-repeatability-reproducibility of part fabrication using an AM technical data package in a distributed manufacturing setting and prove the delivery of AM parts to warfighters deployed at the expeditionary sea, land or air bases. AM baseline was reduced by approximately $0.943 million resulting from overall MANTECH $3.020 million in directed reductions. Impact of the baseline reduction will cause project cancellation or delays to support one of the DLA Strategic Imperatives.</r2:Text>

Benefits include eliminating cancelled requisitions returned to customers as “non-procurable.”  This strategic focus area includes within its scope the Material Acquisition Electronics (MAE) program. 

The Program Roadmap has two major thrusts areas: Digital Microcircuits and Linear/Analog Microcircuits.  The program has several projects addressing specific classes of obsolescent microcircuit technologies.  Over the past several years, obsolescence in this class of microcircuits has greatly increased and has become a significant concern.  These are classes of microcircuits that are expected to become non-procurable in FY2020 and beyond.  Without the technologies planned on the MAE Roadmap, DLA will not be able to support DoD’s requirements for high quality spare parts for critical electronic systems and subsystems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Improving Technical and Logistics Information (ITLI) SFA projects improve and facilitate the communication of technical and logistics information among industry, DLA’s military customers and DLA. This SFA includes the Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST), the Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR), and the Emergent Manufacturing Technology (EMT) portfolios within its scope. 

The Military Unique Sustainment Technology (MUST) program’s focus addresses GAO Report 12-707 recommendations for DoD to establish a “knowledge-based approach” to define, communicate, and collaborate on military unique combat uniforms and individual equipment (CUIE) requirements.  DLA has the responsibility to manage the technical requirements among the Services and the Defense Industrial Base. Currently there is no common environment for collaborating on new requirements among the stakeholders.  The strategic objective of the DLA MUST program is to identify, develop and adopt technologies that can significantly shorten the time needed to transition Combat Uniforms and Individual Equipment from development to operational use from years to months.  The Program focuses on technologies that will transform the military CUIE supply chain from an “electronic paper” (i.e. PDF/MS Word) based manual environment, into a knowledge-based automated environment.  The resulting approach will be a neutral platform that will seamlessly communicate military unique technical requirements throughout the end-to-end supply chain.

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program researches core technology to improve the quality, security, and interoperability of logistics data acquisition and management to enable and streamline DLA operations.  DLA enables transformation of business practices and methodologies as the data for weapons systems evolve from traditional formats and delivery methods (such as two-dimensional images and PDF formats) to newer, more innovative methods (such as three-dimensional solid models, object-oriented databases, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 3C standards).  This transformational shift for DLA is driven by the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) approach, the way industry is delivering design and development data for weapon systems to the Military Services and the way the Military Services in turn manage and provide the data to DLA. DLA Logistics Operations, DLA Acquisition, DLA Tech/Quality, and DLA’s Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) are key stakeholders in the DLIR initiatives to modernize the representation and delivery of weapons systems data.  

The EMT program addresses emerging and out of cycle requirements that always occur as DLA strives to maintain readiness of the aging weapon systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The tools to be implemented are: 1. Supply Request Package (SRP) Tool for Joint Service and DLA Processes; 2. TexSpec Tool for C&amp;T Product Description and Interim Change management; 3. Product Test Center (PTC) Management Tool for source testing and color shade management; 4. MUSTSize Tool for joint tariff optimization.   

The DLIR program plans to continue assisting DLA to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of logistics data across the Enterprise and for the defense industrial base. DLIR will continue promoting and demonstrating the use of methodologies that are computer-aided design(CAD) software-neutral across the military service Engineering Support Activities (ESAs) and Program Management Offices (PMOs) that provide DLA with technical data for Class IX parts.  DLIR will also initiate the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise project working closely with a selected PMO or ESA as it stands up its Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system to operationally test different methods and processes to obtain technical data packages for selected Class IX weapon system parts resident in the PLM system.

The EMT program enables DLA to investigate new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading  well established program efforts. This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner in order to provide to the warfighter earlier. Small business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage/risk. Efforts will begin in FY2019 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.

These tools are in validation testing with key DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textile(C&amp;T)and Service Stakeholders.  Validation will be completed in 2021 and test results will be documented in the Functional Requirements Document(FRD).  The next phase of the program, MUST II, will build on MUST I results and continue technical data modernization with extended focus on integration of manufacturing and testing processes.  It will enable combat uniform and individual equipment technical data to be seamlessly communicated and applied throughout the DLA C&amp;T Supply Chain. For example, settings would be directly fed into the test equipment and results would be accurately communicated to quality assurance.  A new broad agency announcement (BAA) will be released for an anticipated FY 2021 award.

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program will continue with the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) project which will operationally test different methods and processes to obtain technical data packages for selected Class IX weapon system parts directly from ESA/PMO’s PLM system in lieu of the 339 process.  The DLIR program will also initiate the 3D Technical Data Solutions and Digital Rights Management (DRM) projects.  The 3D Technical Data Solutions project will identify one or more commercial viewers that provide the ability to view multiple data formats that may simplify DLA employees work processes, or give DLA additional capabilities to view data provided by the Military Services; and develop standard guidance or advice to Military Service organizations, ESAs and PMOs, to guide and influence their generation of 3D model based TDPs in order to ensure that they support the needs of DLA and its vendor base.  The DRM project will benchmark the DRM technologies currently practiced in the private and public sectors, conduct analyses to determine the right solution for DLA, develop a prototype to validate the requirement, and develop a transition plan.  Additionally, the DLIR program will continue to support DLA’s Technical Data Management Transformation (TDMT) efforts.

The EMT program continues to enable DLA's investigation of new disruptive technology advances that may be implemented in the nearer term, without degrading well established program efforts. This program enables the Agency to advance those technologies sooner in order to provide to the warfighter earlier.  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase III efforts (which cannot be funded with SBIR funds) are a prime example of activities that will be funded with these funds, examples include emerging magnetic braking technologies, and addressing strategic materials shortage/risk.  Efforts will continue in FY2020 to advance Digital Manufacturing by developing a comprehensive approach to take advantage of integrated, computer-based systems of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create and manufacture products to support the warfighter.  Additionally, any emergent Strategic Materials requirements will be addressed through the EMT program.</r2:Text>

The Defense Logistics Information Research (DLIR) program will continue the Connecting the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) project and begin efforts to improve the Federal Catalog in combination with 3D Scanning capabilities.  This project would define the requirements and develop the prototype of the next generation of the federal catalog, including advanced search functions, geometric data representation, and autonomous data validation.  An enhanced catalog would promote the digital twin, i.e., the digital representation of systems and their components, and the use of digital artifacts to design, test and sustain national defense systems.  These capabilities could significantly improve DLA and DOD operations in acquisition, quality control, customer support, and other areas.  Additionally, the DLIR program will continue efforts to collaborate and develop a cyber-physical model that will evaluate the resiliency of OT systems after a cyber-attack and continue to support DLA’s Technical Data Management Transformation (TDMT) efforts.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for providing to the Military Services, and other Federal Agencies, as well as combined and allied forces the full spectrum of logistics, acquisition and technical services. DLA sources and provides virtually 100 percent of the consumable items the military services need to operate – including food, uniforms, fuel and energy, medical supplies, construction and barrier materials and equipment, and more than 85 percent of the military’s spare parts.  DLA also provides logistics services including logistics information data, manages the reutilization of military equipment, and documents automation and production services. DLAs Logistics Research and Development (Log R&amp;D) program helps ensure that advanced logistics concepts and business processes are used to accomplish the agency’s mission with the leanest possible infrastructure.  Log R&amp;D identifies the best commercial business practices and tailors them, as necessary, into the most effective business processes for the agency.  Log R&amp;D develops and demonstrates high risk, high payoff technology that provides a significantly higher level of support at the lowest possible costs. 

The DLA Log R&amp;D program is organized into three Strategic Focus Areas (SFAs):
• Enhancing Analysis, Modeling, and Decision Support (EAMD): R&amp;D efforts to develop decision support tools, such as modeling, simulation, and other analytics to improve operational strategy decision-making, forecasting, and procurement, which support more effective and efficient responses to emerging market and customer requirements.  
• Improving Logistics Processes (ILP): R&amp;D efforts to develop and implement advanced technology in logistics processes over and above current baseline systems.
• Emergent Logistics R&amp;D Requirements (ELR): R&amp;D efforts to support emergent Logistics R&amp;D requirements that arise out of the budget cycle. These out of cycle requirements always occur.  This SFA begins new projects in a timely manner without disrupting ongoing projects by funds reallocation.  This SFA scope includes all DLA supply chains and logistics processes.

DLA’s focus for this budget cycle highlights advanced capabilities in digital and technical data modernization, management and analytics to fulfill the DLA role in the DOD Digital Engineering Strategy and improve sharing of data with the industrial base and supported organizations. Investment explores technologies to lower the Agency’s material acquisition and operations costs and improve weapons systems support. This effort spans across both DLA R&amp;D Program Elements and multiple Strategic Focus Areas, impacting across the DOD Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel and DLA Enterprise logistics processes.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

To qualify for R&amp;D funding, the R&amp;D effort must develop and apply technology and processes over and above current baseline IT systems and continuous improvements efforts.

Although all DLA processes are in scope, the strategic focus for this budget cycle is in Procurement, Planning, Technical Quality and the Major Subordinate Commands.

Innovative process changes and new technologies will be researched in these areas to drive improvements to internal costs, reduce award delays, and improve material availability, supply chain security, demand forecasting and logistical planning. This will be accomplished through the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning, blockchain technology, and research of emerging commercial best practices and technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Another main thrust for FY2019 will be the execution of projects to improve retail operations inventory strategy and to research new processes that leverage DLA’s capabilities in operational and tactical retail operations.  WSS will also leverage condition based maintenance data from the Services to enhance planning for retail operations and depot maintenance logistical support. Initial studies will focus on a single Service.  Artificial intelligence / machine learning capability projects will begin in FY2019 and continue for years to come as additional opportunities are identified.  Also, machine-learning techniques will be applied to processes for lead-time estimation, demand forecasting, low demand inventory strategies, and retail operation strategies.  In addition, the use of blockchain technology in Tech Quality (TQ)  processes that monitor vendor risk will be researched as an initial study of using this technology in DLA processes.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DMEA’s mission is to leverage advanced technologies to provide microelectronics solutions across the entire spectrum of technology development and system acquisition phases.  It is critical to National Security for the Department to maintain technological superiority through microelectronics solutions even when industry is unable or unwilling to provide them.  DMEA provides an in-house capability to quickly develop and deliver timely, cost-effective, technically appropriate solutions to sustain weapon systems, to modernize their capabilities, increase their lethality, address new threats, and meet operational demands.  DMEA augments its in-house capability through extensive industry and government partnerships that enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services to enhance responsiveness, and that develop sources for Trusted microelectronics.

DMEA’s capabilities are critical in an atmosphere of diminishing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capability and increasing worldwide supply chain risks.  The Department has very little influence over the microelectronics industry; the defense market represents less than 0.1% share of the total global semiconductor market.  Assured access to Legacy, State of the Practice (SOTP) and State of the Art (SOTA) technologies is therefore a major and growing challenge.  Threats to defense microelectronics include counterfeiting, Trojan horses, specific reliability issues in military environments, consolidation and off-shoring of manufacturing, rapid obsolescence and diminishing technology availability coming from an unpredictable and unsecured supply chain. In addition, as the Department maintains its weapon systems longer than originally planned, extended use increases demand for sustainment and modernization, which further intensifies the need for DMEA’s unique capabilities.  

The Technology Development program (P001) provides the Department with DMEA engineering expertise and laboratories to address the myriad microelectronics issues and to meet military requirements across the entire spectrum of technology research and development, acquisition, and long-term support. DMEA applies its specialized capabilities to resolve microelectronics issues for hundreds of distinct Department programs across the acquisition lifecycle every year.  In addition, DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Ops, Cyber, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.

The Trusted Foundry program (P003) provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The Trusted Foundry program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Technology Development funds provide DMEA with the resources to maintain an in-house ability to quickly develop and deliver timely, cost-effective, technically appropriate solutions to sustain weapon systems, to modernize their capabilities, increase their lethality, address new threats, and meet operational demands. These funds also support DMEA’s ability to partner with industry, other government agencies, and academia to enable streamlined access to a variety of microelectronics technologies and engineering services. 

These funds enable DMEA to provide increasingly rare government microelectronics design, fabrication, and test expertise to DoD programs. DMEA’s knowledge of varying military requirements across a broad and diverse range of combatant environments and missions—along with its unique technical perspective—allows it to develop, manage and deliver novel, decisive, quick turn microelectronics solutions for defense, intelligence, special operations, and cyber and combat missions.

These funds allow DMEA to maintain and enhance critical, Trusted microelectronics design, aggregation, fabrication, post-processing, assembly and analysis capabilities to ensure that the Department is provided with solutions that enable or maintain the warfighter’s technological superiority over potential adversaries. These solutions use high mix, low volume, unique microelectronics that are endemic to military requirements but are not commercially available. In addition, funding provides for the research, development and support necessary to ensure availability of microelectronics technologies for weapon systems, particularly as the technologies advance and industry is increasingly unable or unwilling to provide them. 

DMEA looks to industry to see if it can provide the required solutions. If industry cannot or will not, only then does DMEA provide the necessary solutions using its in-house capabilities. A critical element required to enable continued success is DMEA’s protection of the industry partners’ valuable Intellectual Property (IP) and processes. DMEA is a small, agile government-owned and operated organization, providing the structure and confidence necessary to assure them that commercial IP is protected from potential competitors. This strategic and cooperative industry partnership approach allows DMEA to use industry-developed IP and processes by acquiring, installing, and applying them toward meeting the immediate and long-term needs of the Department. This unique capability is essential to all major weapon systems, combat operations, and support needs. As such, DMEA serves the Department, other US Agencies, industry and Allied nations. 

DMEA assists hundreds of Department programs every year. DMEA has provided its specialized engineering assistance and capabilities to older systems, current systems, and even to programs not yet in the production phase. Programs that DMEA has recently provided critical support to include Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) System, C-5, V-22, F-15, F-35, RQ-4 Global Hawk, AEGIS Advanced Surface Missile System, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), HH-60G Pave Hawk Helicopter, OSD Joint Fuze Technology Program, among many others. DMEA assists the Combatant Commands (COCOMs) including Special Operations, Intelligence, and the Radiation-Hard communities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Department, other agencies, and the intelligence community require uninterruptible access to state-of-the-art design and manufacturing processes to produce custom integrated circuits designed specifically for military purposes. Under DoDI 5200.44, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in critical/essential systems must be procured from Trusted sources in order to avoid altered or sabotaged parts. Worldwide competition from foreign, state-subsidized manufacturing facilities continues to greatly reduce the number of U.S. semiconductor fabrication facilities available to be Trusted sources.  The prevalence of sophisticated offshore design and manufacturing facilities with economic incentives of state subsidies have resulted in the outsourcing of electronics component and integrated circuit services to these offshore facilities.  This production capability is of increasing importance as domestic semiconductor manufacturing resources continue to decline, especially in the scarce domestic production capacity of high performance and state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies. Commercial sources of microelectronics remain inherently unpredictable and constitute a continued supply chain risk regardless of Government investment.  This trend threatens the integrity and worldwide leadership of the U.S. semiconductor industry by eliminating many domestic suppliers and reducing access to Trusted fabrication sources for advanced technologies, and is of acute concern to the defense and intelligence communities. Secure communications and cryptographic applications, along with most other key defense technologies, depend heavily on high performance semiconductors where a generation of improvement often translates into significant force multipliers and capability advantages.  Important defense technology investments and demonstrations carry size, weight, power, and performance goals that can only be met through the use of the most sophisticated semiconductors. 

The Trusted Foundry program provides the Department with access to state-of-the-art microelectronics design and manufacturing capabilities with the added benefit of Trust, if necessary, to meet their confidentiality, integrity, availability, performance and delivery needs.  The program also provides the Services and other agencies with a competitive cadre of accredited Trusted suppliers that can meet the needs of their mission critical/essential systems for Trusted integrated circuit components.  The Trusted Access Program Office has contracted with commercial sources to satisfy state-of-the-art semiconductor requirements.  DMEA will foster all viable alternatives to continue the vital supply of Trusted microelectronics, including the work of the DMEA Trusted Access Program Office with commercial state-of-the-art industry, as well as the extension and implementation of key process technologies for trust at DMEA.  It is imperative for a wide range of technologies in ongoing and future Department systems that access to Trusted suppliers continues.  Most importantly, access to Trusted Microelectronics is absolutely necessary to meet secure communication and cryptographic needs requiring state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) is a multi-service/multi-agency process improvement and modernization solution, initiated to provide full visibility of the OUSD(C) funds distributed through echelon I and II for the Military Departments, and at all levels for the Defense Agencies.  Funds distribution by its nature is a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems.  The concept of a fully visible enterprise funds distribution process serves as a reference where planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place. 

Within the current DoD environment, progress has been made streamlining a diverse set of stove-piped budget execution and funds distribution processes and systems.  Efforts continue to improve the visibility of funding information, eliminate manual efforts and undue complexities to the management of budget authority, and to eliminate impediments in the flow of funding documents.  The current environment relies heavily on manual processing and on disconnected standalone systems for the processing of Funding Authorization Documents (FADs) and reprogramming actions.  This environment made the implementation of internal controls difficult, negatively impacted the accuracy and timeliness of information while making the processes of integrating and obtaining management information arduous. 

The envisioned operational environment solves these problems by enabling lifecycle program value management in a web-based application utilizing an authoritative database with single-source data entry and automated workflow.  Capabilities within this integrated environment will enable the automation of all funds distribution and funds control processes within OUSD(C) using authoritative and highly visible data.  Specifically, capabilities include managing apportionments, distributing budget authority to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, managing rescissions and continuing resolutions, creating and tracking reprogramming actions, and establishing program baselines and budget authority needed to support changes in funding priorities throughout the year.

The operational environment includes organizational elements down to the echelon II level responsible for managing DoD and Component appropriations operating in an unclassified environment.  The web-based application provides pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The $4.000 million reduction will delay the planned implementation of DAI to the Defense Finance &amp; Accounting Service (DFAS) and will critically hinder the development maturation of Budget Formulation and access control along with major delay in answering audit findings across the Enterprise.
FY2020, the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Technology Transfer Research tax amounted to $0.830 million.
FY2021, internal realignment decreased baseline by $0.375 million for critical Defense Property Accountability System redesign and upgrade requirements.
The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $1.171 million during the Defense-Wide Review to free up resources for higher priority Department needs.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The DAI mission is to deliver auditable Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act compliant business environments for Defense Agencies providing accurate, timely, authoritative financial data supporting the DoD goal of standardizing financial management practices improving financial decision support, and supporting audit readiness.  DAI has replaced several different non-compliant financial management systems supporting diverse operational functions and the warfighter in decision-making and financial reporting.  DAI currently provides the capability to produce timely, auditable reports as noted in three consecutive annual unmodified Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18 (SSAE 18) engagements.

The DAI program modernizes the Defense Agencies’ financial management processes by streamlining financial management capabilities, addressing financial reporting material weaknesses, and supporting financial statement auditability for the majority of agencies, field activities and non-Service organizations across the DoD.  DAI supports a transformation of budget, finance, and accounting processes across participating defense agencies to help improve the quality of financial information, supporting financial auditability and decision-making.  The DAI business solution, once fully implemented, will provide a near real-time, web-based system from a “.mil” environment of integrated business processes that will enable in excess of 84,000 Defense Agency financial managers, program managers, auditors, and Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) representatives to make sound financial business decisions.

The DAI implementation approach deploys a standardized system solution that is consistent with requirements in the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) and the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), while leveraging the out-of-the-box capabilities of the selected Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS), Release 12.2.6 (R12).  DAI implemented an Oracle Office of Management and Budget Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) qualified COTS financial management business solution with common business processes and data standards.  The Program Management Office (PMO) will not develop any objects that are included in core COTS software or services (i.e. vendor data from Federal authoritative sources).

DAI supports the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) Strategic Goal 3, “Reform the Department’s Business Practices for Greater Performance and Affordability as well as Strategic Objectives (SO) 3.1 “Improve and Strengthen business operations through a move to DoD-Enterprise or shared services; reduce administrative and regulatory burden” as well as SO 3.3 Undergo an audit, and improve the quality of budgetary and financial information that is most valuable in managing the DoD.

The primary goal is to deploy a standardized system solution to improve overall financial management and comply with BEA, Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS)/Standard Line of Accounting (SLOA), and Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) requirements.  Common business functions within budget execution include the Department’s BEA End to End (E2E) business processes: Cost Management; Budget to Report (B2R); Procure to Pay (P2P) with enhancements facilitating SFIS/SLOA and DoD procurement data standards and direct Treasury disbursing;  Acquire to Retire (A2R) (real property lifecycle accounting only); Hire to Retire (H2R) (Time and Labor reporting and absence management only); Order to Cash (O2C); Proposal to Reward (P2R) (Grants financial management and accounting only; and a phased implementation of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GCR) capabilities supporting audit readiness.  Future Defense Working Capital Fund accounting, and Re-Sale Accounting (for Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA). 

DAI is currently implemented at 23 Defense Agencies and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD(C)).  DAI supports over 62,000 personnel including, 45,600 users.  The program office is also responsible for operational sustainment of the system.  Funds are required for additional government and contractor support, licenses, maintenance, and hardware to accomplish the remaining capability developments and organizational deployments, and initiate the annual SSAE 18 assertion packages.  In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the system received an unmodified SAE 18 report with no comments. 

The benefits of DAI are:
• Labor efficiencies (entering data once) and shared across all business processes (modules), workflows and lifecycle in a modern system;
• Reduction in contractor support;
• Financial visibility (Access to real-time financial data transactions);
• Enabling agility and resilience in execution (No silos – anyone/anywhere can backfill and work continues);
• Retiring legacy systems;
• Shared common business processes and employment of Federal/DoD Enterprise data standards (i.e., SFIS, SLOA, Procurement Data Standard (PDS) and Procurement Request Data Standard (PRDS)); and
  United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) Chart of Accounts to resolve DoD material weaknesses and deficiencies.
• Reducing reliance on custom Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows by leveraging application upgrades 
• Enhanced Internal controls to ensure accurate data, regulatory compliance and ensuring segregation of duties 
• Significantly reduced data reconciliation requirements; and
• Enhanced analysis and decision support capabilities.

The DAI PMO also provides system integration services that include: acquisition/financial management, project management; blueprinting; design, build, and unit test; developing required Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Extensions, Forms and Workflows (RICE-FW) objects; testing (cyber security/information assurance, integration, functional, performance, conversion, user acceptance, operational); end-user training (train the trainer/change management preparing the users for the cross functional skills and awareness needed to perform well with an integrated enterprise resource planning system); system deployment; conversion; information assurance; sustainment; data service; help desk support; as well as studies and analysis support. 

DLA provides the Milestone Decision Authority (DLA Acquisition), and DLA Information Operations provides the Program Executive Officer, program manager, and PMO staff.  The DAI PMO relies on DLA Acquisition for most contracting. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) data centers provide application, development and test as well as Continuity of Operations (COOP) hosting, Technical Contracting Office for development task orders, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command for Interoperability testing.  The DAI PMO serves as systems integrator. Contracted subject matter experts configure COTS to provide compliant business processes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA's) ability to deliver Americans the right logistics solution in every transaction requires more than successful management of the Agency's wholesale supplies and suppliers.  It requires supply chain excellence.  Our military's ability to generate and sustain combat readiness indefinitely, anywhere on the globe requires that DLA-managed materiel flow seamlessly and as needed from the nation's industrial base to where it is ultimately used.

DLA's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program seeks to solicit innovative research and development proposals from the small business community to address DLA’s strategic and operational requirements.  All selections shall demonstrate and involve some technical risk with yet to be determined technical feasibility.  Phase I proposals should demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology and provide a strong business case for Phase II investment for a prototype or at least a proof-of-concept demonstration.  A favorable return on investment and commercialization potential have a strong influence on Phase II selections.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program explores innovative concepts pursuant to Public Law 106-554 (Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000) and Public Law 107-50 (Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001), which mandates a two-phase competition for small businesses with innovative technologies with a defense application as well as a commercial value.  The SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs will develop new dual-use technologies for possible future DLA operational and sustainment requirements.  Dual-use means the technologies will be judged on their potential for future private sector investment both as a vehicle for reducing development time and cost, unit costs of new DLA technologies, and as a route to national economic growth through new commercial products.  DLA will conduct the competition as well as award and manage the contracts.

The DLA's SBIR/STTR investments are divided into multiple Research Areas identified from within several DLA Elements:

J6 R&amp;D
- Nuclear Enterprise Support Office (NESO) Alternative Sources of Supply
- Additive Manufacturing Technologies, Process Controls, and Supply Chain
- Seamless Self Sealing Fuel Bladders and Inflatables 
- Advanced Battery Manufacturing
- Advanced Aircraft Braking Systems
- Anti-Counterfeiting Technologies
- Strategic Materials Rare Earth Element Source Development
- Warehouse Modernization Technologies
- Subsistence Supply Chain Solutions

DMEA
- Advanced microelectronics concepts, technologies, and applications</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This will entail master tables to maintain standardized data elements, program names, Unit Type, Unit Identification and several others.  Using these master table settings the user will then be able to create Allowance Standards for each Program and Unit Type.  Processes will be created for the Units to identify additional parameters that will then combine the Allowance Standards and these user parameters to generate the Units Authorized Quantity Levels.  The final process will use the DoD Standard methodology of identifying priorities to compare the On Hand Balances to the Authorized Quantities and produce Requisitioning Lists for the units to fulfill their asset requirements.

DPAS will retrieve Contract Numbers, CLINS, Quantity and Price from Electronic Document Access to create Due In/Pending transactions in DPAS to provide the Property Management Personnel oversight of assets expected for delivery.  These transactions will match to IRAPT transactions as the assets are shipped/received.

DPAS will continue to provide support for the Financial Audit.  The Department will have completed the first full audit and have findings that must be addressed.  DPAS will work with each Service or Agency to determine the areas that DPAS can increase capability to permit the findings to be closed.  At this time it is difficult to specifically state what these capabilities may be but DPAS is used by all components of the Department so there are sure to be areas that DPAS can implement capabilities to permit the Components to address the findings</r2:Text>

It has developed innovative technologies, and has provided operational support for an (unclassified) integrated multi-hazard hazard monitoring, early warning and decision support system, called RAPIDS, for the department since 2007.  The system, covering global hazard is frequently used by COCOMS, particularly PACOM and SOUTHCOM, for HA/DR missions and exercises, and was recently selected as one of the most effective systems in a position paper by the department, reviewing all unclassified information sharing systems. “Expanded use of RAPIDS across the DoD at the Combatant Commands, Joint Task Force, and by deployed units from the services” was identified as ”a primary Joint Staff objective” in a memorandum dated July 6, 2017.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The PDC has been in operation since February 1996. The PDC is a public/private partnership managed by the University of Hawaii (UH) under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense.  The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) function, manpower, and budget resources transferred to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) (OUSD(A&amp;S)) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in October 2011.

The USD(P) will continue to be the Operational Sponsor and functional OSD Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for the program.  The PDC is a world-recognized authority and leader in science and information technology applications relating to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). PDC’s applications and information products enhance preparedness, situational awareness, and civil-military communications for humanitarian missions worldwide, while its national-level socio-economic Risk and Vulnerability Assessments help inform strategies by measuring indicators for national resiliency using scientific methods.

The PDC Program Office’s (USD(P),ASD(HD&amp;GS), and DASD(DC&amp;MA)) primary responsibility is for management and stewardship of governmental funds provided in Defense Department appropriations for DoD missions associated with DoD CrM, HA/DR, Theater Security Cooperation, and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). In doing this, the Program Office develops and provides policy, oversight and guidance, and jointly develops strategic guidelines, programmatic content and priorities with the UH and PDC. The PDC Program Office also serves as a support element of the Hawaii-based organization especially in the area of gaining Federal agency support and resources, as well as business opportunities.</r2:Description>

The PDC prepares the public, disaster managers, governments, and others to mitigate the effects of disasters.  The goal is to have people and technology work together to preserve life, safeguard livelihoods, protect property to foster disaster-resilient communicates. Projects obtained and funded from this customer base serve as a means to determine PDC product and services relevancy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

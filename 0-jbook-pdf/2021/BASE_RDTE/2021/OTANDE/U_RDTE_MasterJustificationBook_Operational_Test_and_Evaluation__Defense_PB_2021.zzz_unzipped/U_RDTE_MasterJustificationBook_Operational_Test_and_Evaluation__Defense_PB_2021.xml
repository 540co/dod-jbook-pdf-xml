                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 235 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Reporting results of OT&amp;E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     The review and development of recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) was created by Congress in 1983.  The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&amp;E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 235 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&amp;E of the program is complete.  DOT&amp;E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&amp;E's oversight authority include: 

-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).
-     The approval of component OT&amp;E Test Plans (TPs).
-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.
-     Reporting results of OT&amp;E that support BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&amp;E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.
-     The review and development of recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&amp;E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.

DOT&amp;E also oversees and resources OT&amp;E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability
( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. 

DOT&amp;E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&amp;E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, DFAS support, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

This effort is in direct support of the Director’s Title 10 responsibilities and is a continuing effort. Funding for FY 2019 provides Operational Test and Evaluation inputs for Test and Evaluation Master Plans, Test Plans, System Acquisition Reports, Defense Acquisition Executive Summary Reports for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and OUSD(A&amp;S). Key elements of DOT&amp;E oversight authority are identified in Calendar Year 2019 Office of the Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List. 

Cyber Evaluations
DOT&amp;E plans to sponsor approximately 25 Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service cybersecurity assessments and Cyber Readiness Campaigns (CRCs) events in FY 2019, each including “Find-Fix-Verify” efforts to facilitate the remediation of identified vulnerabilities and verify that solutions and mitigations improve warfighter mission assurance. DOT&amp;E plans to continue working with the CCMDs and Services to develop multiyear plans for exercise cyber assessments and CRC events. These plans will focus on assessing the CCMD’s or Service’s ability to complete missions in a contested cyber environment. To support threat-representative assessments, and to facilitate improvement of DoD’s cybersecurity posture, DOT&amp;E will continue efforts with U.S. Cyber Command to implement the Global Persistent Cyber Opposing Force (PCO) capability with authorities to perform year-round and long-duration assessments of all CCMDs and Services. Primary objectives for DOT&amp;E’s assessments in FY 2019 include the portrayal of advanced nation-state cyber threats and the assessment of operational missions during realistic cyber attacks and any corresponding response actions to adversary attacks. 

DOT&amp;E will assess Cyber Protection Teams and Cyber Mission Teams when they participate during PCO, CRC, or exercise events. DOT&amp;E will continue to develop techniques to efficiently and effectively assess offensive cyber capabilities, conduct timely evaluations of these capabilities, and consider the development of a potential cyber variant of the Joint Munition Effectiveness Manual.  DOT&amp;E will fund joint assessments of Mode 5 Identification of Friend or Foe capabilities.  DOT&amp;E will transmit critical findings to DoD leadership along with recommended actions to improve DoD’s cybersecurity posture. FY 2019 evaluations will include trend analyses across prior year results, both within and across CCMDs.</r2:Text>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of LFT&amp;E.  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives. JLF was initiated in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets. Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command, and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to increase the affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of Tri-Service aircraft through joint coordination and development of survivability technologies, design tools and assessment methodologies.  The JASP coordinates and conducts RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability, and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) and is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered 50 years ago to serve as Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) focal point for munitions effectiveness information. The JTCG/ME produces Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) that are the sole source for all Joint Service Authenticated non-nuclear weapons effectiveness data and methodology for DoD. The JMEMs are the “how to” manuals for putting ordnance on target and as such, directly impacts combat readiness, effectiveness, and survivability. JMEMs are used by the Warfighters in operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training; by the DoD, Joint, and Service planners in force-on-force modeling, mission area analysis, requirements studies and weapon procurement planning; and by the service acquisition community in performance assessment, analysis of alternatives and survivability enhancement studies. The JTCG/ME continually evolves weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data, standards, methodologies, and processes based on the strategic environment for better munitions effectiveness evaluation and support to a more lethal force. JTCG/ME also increases efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department’s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners. The JMEM requirements and development processes are driven by operational lessons learned (Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel), Joint Staff Data Call and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee (MTC) guided by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5140.01, Munitions Requirements Process (MRP) - DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3000.04 and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWGs) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. Considerable effort goes into these user forums to establish Warfighter requirements for current and future JTCG/ME products, as well as continued training events and day-to-day support -- all with the goal of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources.  

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP, and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E), Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME).  

This Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of LFT&amp;E.  The primary objective of LFT&amp;E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&amp;E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&amp;E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&amp;E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.

This Program Element also supports DoD’s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&amp;E related initiatives. JLF was initiated in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets. Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.

The Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD’s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command, and USAF Life Cycle Management Center to increase the affordability, readiness, and effectiveness of Tri-Service aircraft through joint coordination and development of survivability technologies, design tools and assessment methodologies.  The JASP coordinates and conducts RDT&amp;E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability, and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) and is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&amp;E.

The Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) was chartered 50 years ago to serve as Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) focal point for munitions effectiveness information. The JTCG/ME produces Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) that are the sole source for all Joint Service Authenticated non-nuclear weapons effectiveness data and methodology for DoD. The JMEMs are the “how to” manuals for putting ordnance on target and as such, directly impacts combat readiness, effectiveness, and survivability. JMEMs are used by the Warfighters in operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations, mission planning, and training; by the DoD, Joint, and Service planners in force-on-force modeling, mission area analysis, requirements studies and weapon procurement planning; and by the service acquisition community in performance assessment, analysis of alternatives and survivability enhancement studies. The JTCG/ME continually evolves weapons effectiveness and target vulnerability data, standards, methodologies, and processes based on the strategic environment for better munitions effectiveness evaluation and support to a more lethal force. JTCG/ME also increases efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department’s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners. The JMEM requirements and development processes are driven by operational lessons learned (Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel), Joint Staff Data Call and the needs of Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, Military Targeting Committee (MTC) guided by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5140.01, Munitions Requirements Process (MRP) - DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3000.04 and Operational Users Working Groups (OUWGs) input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. Considerable effort goes into these user forums to establish Warfighter requirements for current and future JTCG/ME products, as well as continued training events and day-to-day support -- all with the goal of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources.  

This program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&amp;E, JASP, and JTCG/ME programs.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The FY 2019 JLF budget will support at least 28 projects (tentatively 9 new starts and 19 projects continuing from previous FYs).  JLF projects have been focused to either (1) build a more lethal force, (2) strengthen alliances and attract new partners, or (3) reform the department for greater performance and affordability.

Build a More Lethal Force
In FY 2019, JLF will continue to investigate means to advance the survivability therefore lethality of our systems in expected theater of operations. As an example, JLF will assess the vulnerability of aircraft to fuel tank fires due to ullage ignition in order to explore methods to reduce aircraft losses while maintaining mission effectiveness.  JLF will investigate the penetration of long yawed rods in order to support munition development such as the AIM-9X, ensuring the desired lethal effects are achieved when these weapons are employed.  JLF will also improve test instrumentation to allow more accurate assessment of imposed forces and crew casualties during mine or improvised explosive device attacks.  JLF will be performing assessments of flammable materiel commonly found in current Naval vessels during operations to better model and prevent fire initiation, as well as promote better design to contain the spread of fire and improve fire suppression techniques.

Strengthen Alliances and Attract New Partners
JLF is leveraging existing M&amp;S tools and expanding their capabilities to expand evaluation of active protection systems that may be installed on a variety of U.S. platforms to defend against a variety of threats.  This work will be performed particularly in conjunction with efforts of partner nations such as Israel.  Furthermore, JLF will conduct a variety of underwater explosion tests and analyses of effects upon ship hulls.  These tests will be using hardware from a decommissioned Canadian ship and test execution conducted in cooperation with both Canadian and European Union partners.

Reform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability
In FY 2019, the JLF program is sponsoring work by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Air Force Institution of Technology to assess the merits of test program methodologies utilized across industry, academia, and government, with the goal of leveraging the merits of these communities toward evaluating lethality/survivability.  JLF will produce frameworks to allow the DoD to better tailor Live Fire test rigor for a variety of program timelines, including a sensitivity analysis to determine what general qualities are most important to test before rapidly fielding hardware or software.  In addition, JLF will better quantify the point of diminishing returns for major program of record Live Fire test programs in order to maximize return on investment.  Finally, JLF efforts will allow the DoD to better model the combined effects of multiple complex systems in a multi-model threat environment (for example, combined air and ground threats combined with electronic attack and cyber attack), enhancing performance in battle as well as focusing DoD investment in new hardware technologies.

JASP
In FY 2019 the JASP will continue work on at least 23 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate 11 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will develop measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness, hostile fire identification, and degraded visual environment flight capabilities; advancing system hardening against ballistic and high energy laser threats; and improving aircraft crashworthiness. Improve aircraft survivability to fire by increasing the speed and efficiency of fire detection and suppression systems and the accuracy and confidence in prediction of threat initiated fires onboard aircraft. The Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness
In FY 2019, JTCG/ME will continue to develop, enhance, and standardize methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness. This includes target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and CCMDs’ needs.

JTCG/ME will deploy and continue to enhance future versions of its major JTCG/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) products, the JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS), Joint Antiair Combat Effectiveness (J-ACE), Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool, and the Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE). JTCG/ME will continue to progress and develop non-kinetic JMEM capability with Joint-Non-Kinetic Effects (J-NKE) Tool, as well as support specialized solutions to address operational needs to include direct  analytical support to operations, Probability of kill (Pk) Lookup Tools, Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) analysis and tables, and munitions weaponeering guides. Since JTCG/ME products are User focused and requirements driven, JTCG/ME will continue to maintain and strengthen relationships with the Warfighter, operational users, and coalition partners to establish requirements for current and future products. Efforts will  include forums, training, foreign military sales, and day-to-day operational support. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility and greater lethality in a more dynamic combined operational environment.

In FY 2019, JTCG/ME plans to:
-Sustain/support fielded JWS v2.3, with efforts including multiple training and user forums for the fielded product.
-Finish and field JWS v2.3.1. which is an update to integrate a new display viewer compatible with evolving image formats (non-segmented imagery), to synchronize with the DIEE v2.1 viewer. 
-Develop JWS v2.4, which will provide enhanced data, Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST), and connectivity capabilities, while maximizing the final JWS v2.x product line. Specific highlights include interim enhanced database capabilities with updated data sets to include up to 13 new calculated targets and 70 refreshed targets. The enhanced database capabilities will allow for accelerated, out of production cycle weapons and target data updates, tailored product versions for releasability, and more effective, focused testing. Capabilities include Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze and trajectory model updates, as well as FIST v2.4 with several expanded methodologies for structural target response variables. These capabilities will enable more options to the weaponeer and improve the underlying phenomenology representation in JWS.
-Continue development on the next JWS series, known as JWS v3.x. The JWS v3.x line leverages Endgame Framework (EF) as the underlying software architecture that will maximize modularity, flexibility of design, and reuse of standard capabilities across the community for greater performance and affordability. FY 2019 efforts and deliverables will include updated Capability Needs Statement response documentation, JWS v3.0 EF Implementation Plan, JMEM Effects Library (JEL) Capabilities Roadmap and Smart book, DIEE v2.x to Application Program Interface (API) Implementation Plan, enhanced JWS Product Management Structure, and continuing to coordinate with stakeholders. These efforts form the foundation of JWS v3.0 fielding in 2020.  
-Support current use and future development requirements by hosting and supporting JWS training sessions, Operational Users Working groups (OUWG), and User help desk support via the JMEM Product Information Access System (JPIAS) and JWS newsletter. Specifically, JTCG/ME will support approximately 30 JWS training sessions with about 500 students. The training sessions allow users to optimize use of JWS capabilities, while providing JTCG/ME with critical input on Warfighter use for future development. OUWGs are critical venues for receiving direct User feedback and development of future requirements from the operational community in regard to needed software enhancements and capabilities in support of air‑to‑surface and surface-to-surface weaponeering. In addition, direct forward support to Combatant Commanders/Task Forces will be provided to enable target materiel development, weaponeering, and CDE solution development. JTCG/ME will continue to chair OUWGs, with participation from USCENTCOM, USAFRICOM, USSTRATCOM, USPACOM, USSOCOM, the Services, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Fires Center of Excellence, Service School Houses, the Marine Aviation Weapons/Tactics Squadron, Operations Support Squadrons, Intelligence Squadrons, and numerous other operational units.
-Facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums. JTCG/ME will deliver JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to key coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements. These deliveries increase efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department’s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering and targeting capability to Coalition partners, as well as improve the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments. JTCG/ME will also hold information exchange forums via information exchange agreements (IEAs) with the United  Kingdom and Republic of Korea. These exchanges facilitate collaboration on methodologies and efforts of mutual interest in the area of weapons effectiveness/collateral damage estimation. 
-Develop and enhance processes to supply target vulnerability data to operational and acquisition communities. The JTCG/ME conducts detailed vulnerability analysis to produce tri-service approved target vulnerability information (i.e., Target Geometric Model (TGM) development, Failure Analysis Logic Tree (FALT), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), etc). These data are used to feed the approved vulnerability models to generate the target data used on JMEMs. In addition, acquisition programs leverage JTCG/ME target vulnerability data to conduct detailed analysis of their new capabilities against threat targets. The leveraging of this information saves programs valuable time and resources, and ensures the acquisition community is using consistent and valid threat representation.
-Support urgent operational needs for target vulnerability data with rapid response surrogation and development of Pk Lookup data for high priority weapons and targets. These specialized products directly assist CCMDs to meet the operational requirements of a dynamic environment as formal products are developed.
-Continue to collect, approve, and supply weapons characteristics data and standards for the tri-service community to include soon to be fielded systems. These weapons are:  Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II; Small Guide Munition (SGM) GBU-69; Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) GBU-39; Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM); Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS); Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM); and High speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM).
-Enhance weapons characterization processes and communication through the JTCG/ME Test Assistance Group (TAG). The TAG provides a forum that fuses science and art of weapon testing with subject matter experts from all the services and test ranges to review, adopt technologies and methods that reduce expense, time, anomalies, and expanded data collection. JTCG/ME archives and publishes these weapon characterization standards in updates to the JTCG/ME Weapon Test Procedures Manual (TPM) used by weapon test ranges. The TAG also facilitates partnerships and leveraging. These technologies and partnerships have the potential to reduce the number of weapon test articles required and remove labor-intensive activities from weapon testing.
-Update and execute strategic roadmaps for underlying vulnerability and lethality models used as standards by the tri-service community to better support JWS 3.x development and Live Fire Testing and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). These roadmaps align JTCG/ME funded and related tasks by other services and programs to facilitate leveraging. In addition, the roadmaps provide a tool for future investment planning to support modeling and simulation validation and resolution of capability gaps. A key roadmap component included several interconnected model sensitivity studies. The goal of these studies is to understand the range of potential model outputs, including stochastic variations in penetration and other processes, so that differences between test data and predictive models can be better understood. This will be used to guide live fire testing requirements for validation of the models for a program office's specific operational envelope. These studies will also provide data to support several model reaccreditations.
-Develop and accredit Collateral Effects Radii (CER) Reference Tables in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01C, “No-Strike and the Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Methodology”  for air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology. The JTCG/ME CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all Areas of Responsibility Operation (AORs) to meet Commanders’ intent and to minimize civilian casualties. As such, it is critical to the Warfighters’ ability to meet urgent operational needs. JTCG/ME implements the CER and CDE methodology within the DCiDE tool. DCiDE is an accredited and automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE enables JTCG/ME to continuously support the CJCSI 3160.01 series, DCiDE was the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM AORs.
-Maintain and support DIEE v2.1, DIEE is an enterprise targeting solution that provides both seamless planning and linkage to various mission planning systems and tools in operational units. It is a “Government off the shelf” (GOTS) product for advanced target development that integrates Target Coordinate Mensuration (TCM), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Weaponeering, and data basing functions. DIEE was selected as the preferred operational solution of a 2018 Air Force Advanced Target Development (ATD) Software Fly-off based on 135 hours of hands-on time and 451 scored line items. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued guidance stating that,”The Services, Combatant Commands, and Combat Support Agencies will upload and use DIEE v2.1 for automated CDE to comply with the updated methodology and reporting requirement.” DIEE v2.1 includes user requested enhancements, more advanced JWS interface for weaponeering capability, CJCSI 3160.01C compliant CER Reference Tables and DCiDE for CDE capability, and updated Common Geopositioning Services (CGS) for Precision Point Mensuration (PPM) capability.
-Continue to develop future DIEE versions that will include CGS updates, 3-D viewer capability, direct Collateral Effects Library (CEL) interfacing, route tool user requested enhancements, battle damage assessment graphic production, and initial android tablet capabilities, while maintaining Warfighter support and future requirements through training and User forums.
-Leverage CEL and other high fidelity techniques to deliver analysis packages for collateral damage mitigation, post-forensic, and force protect analyses packages to operational Users for high value targets in current operations (i.e., Operations Inherent Resolve, Operation Resolute Support, and Operation Freedom Sentinel). These efforts directly assist Combatant Commands to meet commander’s intent and minimize collateral damage.
-Continue the Enhanced Weaponeering and Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) Program, a multi-year test program focused on enhancing and validating JTCG/ME CDE tools. This program will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces while not increasing risk of collateral damage by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities to make their strike decision calls. FY 2019 efforts leverage seven FY 2018 testing events and multiple collaboration forums. FY 2019 tests will include four buried ordnance tests to evaluate the effects of burial and weapon class on warhead performance, crater ejecta, and collateral damage, and five building debris characterization tests. 
-Initiate the “Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) of Deliberate and Dynamic Strikes“analysis to directly support the solution offered by the Munition Strategic Portfolio Review to address the current state of the Department's munitions stockpile. The effort is a multi-year task to analyze ongoing strikes required to update JWS to: (1) ensure effective and efficient munition expenditure rates and (2) mitigate the stockpile stress. The analysis approach will include: (1) establishing an analytical cell to provide a detailed and usable Department-level combat assessment of past, current, and future strikes/weapons employments, (2) establishing an archival database that captures the pre- and post-strike assessments of these engagements, in a format that will be called upon by the JWS to select strike packages with optimal and efficient munition expenditures, and (3) guiding tactics improvement for evolving environments and methodology development to improve weaponeering tools.  Overall impact of effort will result in increased operational agility for the Combatant Commands in terms of weapons employment, as well as directly link current JMEM predictions to operational battlefield performance.
-Sustain/support fielded J-ACE v5.3. Efforts will include multiple training and user forums for the fielded product. These forums
are pivotal for J-ACE developers to understand requirements and align development with other external debrief and analytical
capabilities that use J-ACE as the underlying analytical engine to underpin results. Many users leverage J-ACE’s API to link
debrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the Joint community. The forums allows J-ACE external application
developers to receive any updates and interact with J-ACE developer to refine requirements and plans.
-Leverage a parallel J-ACE development strategy that will continue to develop J-ACE v5.x line to provide high priority data and capabilities to the User community, while developing J-ACE v6.x product line.
-Finish and field J-ACE v5.3.1. J-ACE is used as a stand-alone product or through an application interface. Many users leverage J-ACE’s API to link debrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the joint community. J-ACE v5.3.1 is a software update release to provide a high priority requirement by the API user community for J-ACE v5.3 64-bit capability.  
-Finish J-ACE v5.4 development. J-ACE v5.4 will include updated Plug-and-Play weapons and aircraft data, updated countermeasures, and a new cross platform BROWSE module, which contains descriptive information for each player (weapon, aircraft). In addition, J-ACE v5.4 will include a new Endgame Manager (EM) module that simulates terminal effects of the weapon lethality and target vulnerability. The faster EM has improved speed of new fuze model and refined graphic display data generation, and includes more weapon lethality-target vulnerability data sets. 
-Continue J-ACE v6.x development. The J-ACE v6.0 will fully migrate Hybrid Interactive Visualization Engine (HIVE) framework capability as the underlying software architecture that will maximize modularity, provide flexibility for faster software development/modification, and reuse of standard capabilities across the aircraft survivability community. J-ACE v6.0 will include a new User Interface with state-of-art graphical displays including Virtual Reality (VR). J-ACE v6.0 will address improved target detection capability leveraging National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Radio Frequency (RF) models. J-ACE v6.x includes an initial Suppression of Enemy Air Defense/Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD/DEAD) Capability (Air-to-Surf Weapons Trajectory and Arrival). J-ACE v6.x will address longer development requirements to include rotary wing aircraft capability, expanded SEAD/DEAD capability, and increased electronic warfare and counter-measure capabilities.
-Continue to develop J-NKE as the single source for operational Warfighters, analysts, targeteers, and planners to analyze
offensive cyber capabilities and directed energy effectiveness. FY 2019 efforts will build upon FY 2018 initial program efforts.
-Development of cyber effects estimation capabilities with a focus on refining the standardization of data required to address weapon characterization, target vulnerability, Operational Environment, and Uncertainty Metrics to support the development of the Cyber Operation Lethality and Effectiveness (COLE) tool. Continue to mature Cyber JMEM capabilities with continued execution of multiyear plan. Cyber FY 2019 capability development/deliverables include: (1) Development of Data Producer App (1.0) to support creation of J-NKE standard/compliant data, (2) COLE v0.1 with initial Operational Environment Model creation, weapon-target probabilistic attack (Probability of effect (Pe) calculation for individual targets/nodes w/minimal target characteristic uncertainties and initial probabilistic matching  providing weapon/target pairing recommendations for select capabilities/uncertainties, (3) Draft Uncertainty Metric Model (UM2) standards document, (4) Draft Cyber Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) methodology, (5) Revised Weapon, Target, OEM &amp; Cyber Effectiveness Table (CET) standards (based on relevant feedback). Other FY 2019 efforts include maintaining User community interaction, as well as maturing linkages to USCYBERCOM and other key stakeholders, to ensure Combatant Command and Service Warfighter requirements and needs are articulated and understood. Continue Operational User Working Group meetings along with various face-to-face unit level meetings. FY 2019 efforts are the building blocks for maturing capabilities and fielding of Cyber JMEMs.
-Continue to coordinate with a FY 2018/2019 Joint Test Project to leverage, enhance, and develop directed energy effects estimation and standardization tools. The FY 2018/2019 Joint Test Project, Joint Laser Systems Effectiveness (JLaSE), was approved as a conduit for warfighters to solve joint laser operational issues and provide a non-material solution to the warfighter. Efforts will take advantage of work completed by the Directed Energy Joint Transition Office (DE JTO) and various planned Use Cases (Surface-to-Air, Surface-to-Surface, Air-to-Surface) throughout the two year cycle. Focus will be on Service near term capabilities (~10 capabilities) that take advantage of the high-energy laser (HEL) weapons low cost per shot, deep magazine, precision engagement, and scalable effects.
-Continue to mature DE effectiveness capabilities with execution of multiyear plan. FY 2019 efforts will build upon FY 2018 outcomes, while continuing the work and leveraging of the FY 2018/2019 Joint Test Project, JLaSE. Leveraging and cooperation between JTCG/ME and JLaSE will facilitate lessons learned, data standards, methodology standards, and working relations imperative in the fruition of a DE effectiveness, weaponeering, and CDE solution for the Warfighter. FY 2019 outcomes will include initial prototype and methodologies for DE effectiveness and collateral damage estimation. The eventual results of the multi-year tasking will provide Joint Fire Support Planners and Targeteers the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Weaponeering and Collateral Damage Estimation, to adequately plan for and execute Directed Energy Laser Weapons in the joint battlespace.
-The JLaSE effort will conclude in FY 2019. JTCG/ME is pursuing future out-year funding to continue the development of the DE effectiveness, weaponeering, and CDE solution for the Warfighter, based on the successful JLaSE and JTCG/ME partnership in FY 2018 and FY 2019.</r2:Text>

The FY 2020 budget will enable the LFT&amp;E Deputate to: (1) assess the adequacy of programs’ test and evaluation plans and generate new test and evaluation policies, as needed; (2) review and analyze the test data to support an independent evaluation of the survivability/lethality of the systems in support of the development of OSD Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports to Congress; and (3) review major acquisition plans, reports, and requirement documents to inform system design and capability development.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives
The FY 2020 JLF budget will support at least 20 projects (tentatively 8 new efforts and 12 projects continuing from previous FYs).  Project’s objectives will directly support NDS objectives to include building a more lethal force, new partnerships, or DoD business reforms. 

Build a More Lethal Force
In FY 2020, JLF will continue to increase the accuracy and capability of critical modeling and simulation tools to support test and evaluation efficiency and ensure credibility of DOD assessments and weaponeering tools.
- For example, one effort will increase the capability of existing naval M&amp;S survivability and lethality evaluation tools. More specifically the project will develop more accurate damage effects as the threat penetrates multiple ship compartments, as typically seen in a realistic engagement.
- Another effort will increase the capability of existing M&amp;S tools used to evaluate fire propagation across ship compartments and the ensuing threat to the ship/occupants, as well as recoverability capabilities pertaining to the damage caused by spreading fires.

JLF efforts will also continue to resolve survivability and lethality related system design challenges of currently fielded U.S. systems.
- For example, one JLF effort will address an evaluation shortfall related to body armor performance.  Existing LFT&amp;E methods do not adequately correlate body armor data to actual injury.  This task will support the development of appropriate measures, techniques, and analyses to enable a more credible correlation of body armor data with injury.
- JLF will enable the development of more rigorous test infrastructure needed to evaluate the effectiveness of fuel self-sealing bladders with aircraft.  Self-sealing bladders could significantly mitigate the vulnerability to the aircrew.  This test infrastructure will ensure self-sealing bladder's performance is more accurately characterized prior to final design reviews.		

Reform the Department for Greater Performance and Affordability
In coordination with the Army and the Air Force, JLF will increase aircraft and ground combat vehicle survivability/lethality M&amp;S.
- One effort will apply innovative techniques to increase the efficiency of existing M&amp;S tools largely used to estimate lethality of piercing threats against our systems.  Improved lethality models will increase the credibility of our lethality evaluations and the credibility of weaponeering tools.

JLF will also continue to lead innovation in LFT&amp;E methods to increase LFT&amp;E efficiency and support rapid fielding.
- A new effort will develop an advanced teaming analysis capability to enable future survivability and lethality evaluations of a system-of-systems.  Current LFT&amp;E has limited capability to assess the effectiveness of the system in the context of other supporting systems.  LFT&amp;E is currently constrained to single system analyses, which is not always operationally representative.
- Another new JLF effort will provide an M&amp;S capability that will enable efficient evaluation of active protection systems integrated with ground combat vehicles.
- JLF will develop machine learning algorithms to more effectively characterize armor performance.  Such algorithms will enable efficient LFT&amp;E of future armor compositions and will inform future armor designs.

JASP
In FY 2020 the JASP will continue work on 27 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate 13 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will support the NDS objective to ‘Build a More Lethal Force’ by developing measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by advancing system hardening against rocket-propelled grenade, small-arms, and high-energy laser threats and increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness. Reform the DoD for Greater Performance and Affordability by funding the development of more efficient M&amp;S tools and threat models to enable more effective aircraft survivability capability development, test and evaluation. 

The Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT) will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue, and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness
In FY 2020, JTCG/ME efforts will continue to assist the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in supporting the National Defense Strategy lines of effort of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources through efficiency. 

JTCG/ME will: 
-Develop, enhance, and standardize data/methodologies for evaluating munitions effectiveness. This includes target vulnerability characterization, munitions lethality, weapon system accuracy, and specific weapon-target pairings driven primarily from current operational lessons learned, Joint Staff Data Calls, and Combatant Commands’ (CCMDs) needs. 
-Field and continue to enhance future versions of its kinetic JTCG/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) products to include the JMEM Weaponeering System (JWS), Joint Antiair Combat Effectiveness (J-ACE), Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool, and the Digital Imagery Exploitation Engine (DIEE). 
-Develop non-kinetic JMEMs capability to include Cyber Operations Lethality and Effectiveness (COLE) and Joint Laser Weaponeering Software (JLaWS) products, as well as High Power Microwave (HPM) and Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) Fires data/tool sets. 
-Support specialized solutions to address operational needs to include direct analytical support to operations, Probability of kill (Pk) Lookup Tools, Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE) analysis and tables, and air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weaponeering guides. 
-Continue to execute a multi-year test program to enhance weaponeering/collateral damage estimation in complex environments.
-Improve the utilization of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) data to more effectively and efficiently estimate munition expenditure rates and mitigate stockpile stress, while improving CCMDs’ force effects.
-Continue to maintain and strengthen relationships with the Warfighter, operational users, and coalition partners to establish requirements for current and future products, through forums, training, foreign military sales, and reachback operational support. The objective is to provide efficient and effective support to meet CCMD current and future needs for agility and greater lethality in a more dynamic combined operational environment.
-Increase efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and support the Department’s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering, targeting, and collateral damage estimation (prevent civilian casualties) capability to Coalition partners through foreign military sales.
-Continue to build and implement the next JTCG/ME JMEM product lines on a foundation of effects libraries using software frameworks enabling quicker development, flexibility, leveraging, and tailoring.
-Study and implement the use of machine learning and data analytics to improve quality of existing solutions, decrease computation time of applications, and answer questions previously not possible.

Specifically in FY 2020, JTCG/ME plans to:
-Sustain/support fielded JWS v2.3.1, with efforts including multiple training and user forums for the fielded product.
-Field JWS v2.4/develop JWS v2.4.x updates (as needed), which provides enhanced data, Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST), and connectivity capabilities, while maximizing the final JWS v2.x product line as the future weaponeering product line is developed/completed. Specific highlights include interim enhanced database capabilities with updated data sets to include CCMD’s high priority calculated, refreshed, and surrogated targets. The enhanced database capabilities allow accelerated, out of production cycle weapons and target data updates, tailored product versions for releasability, and more effective, focused testing. New capabilities include Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze and trajectory model updates, as well as FIST v2.4 with several expanded methodologies for structural target response variables. These capabilities enable more options to the weaponeer and improve the underlying phenomenology representation in JWS.
-Facilitate coalition interoperability and information exchange forums. JTCG/ME will deliver JWS version releases and standalone Pk Lookup tools to coalition partners in support of current operations under Foreign Military Sales agreements. These deliveries increase efficiency by leveraging ongoing Department efforts and supporting the Department’s intent to complement U.S. interest and capabilities by providing weaponeering/targeting and collateral damage estimation capability to Coalition partners, as well as improve the effectiveness of U.S. fires and targeting personnel working in combined environments. JTCG/ME will also hold information exchange forums via information exchange agreements (IEAs) with the United Kingdom and Republic of Korea. These exchanges facilitate collaboration on methodologies and efforts of mutual interest in the area of weapons effectiveness/collateral damage estimation. These efforts will directly support Presidential Conventional Arms Control Policy to build partner capacity to prevent civilian casualties.
-Develop and enhance processes to supply target vulnerability data to operational and acquisition communities. The JTCG/ME conducts detailed vulnerability analysis to produce tri-service approved target vulnerability information (i.e., Target Geometric Model (TGM) development, Failure Analysis Logic Tree (FALT), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), etc.). These data are used to feed the approved vulnerability models to generate the target data used on JMEMs. In addition, acquisition programs leverage JTCG/ME target vulnerability data to conduct detailed analysis of their new capabilities against threat targets. Similarly, JTCG/ME leverages target vulnerability modeling capabilities developed during acquisition. The leveraging of this information saves programs and JTCG/ME valuable time and resources, and ensures the acquisition and operational communities are using consistent/valid threat representation and similar vulnerability/lethality modeling capabilities. A significant focus of FY 2020 efforts will be planning and transition of target vulnerability capabilities to the JMEM Effects Library (JEL) for use on next generation weaponeering and targeting JMEMs.
-Support urgent operational needs for target vulnerability data with rapid response surrogation and development of Pk Lookup data for high priority weapons and targets. These specialized products directly assist CCMDs to meet the operational requirements of a dynamic environment.
-Continue to collect/improve, approve, and supply weapons characteristics data and standards for the tri-service community to include soon to be fielded systems. These weapons are: Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) II; Small Glide Munition (SGM) GBU-69; Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) GBU-39; Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM); Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System (JMEWS); Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM); and High speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM). JTCG/ME also continues to monitor future weapon systems to work longer lead methodology needs. A significant focus of FY 2020 efforts will be planning and transition of weapons characteristics capabilities to the JEL (database design, integration, and interfaces) for use on next generation weaponeering and targeting JMEMs.
-Enhance weapons characterization processes and communication through the JTCG/ME Test Assistance Group (TAG). The TAG provides a forum that fuses science and art of weapon testing with subject matter experts from all the services and test ranges to review, adopt technologies and methods that reduce expense, time, anomalies, and expanded data collection. JTCG/ME archives and publishes these weapon characterization standards in updates to the JTCG/ME Weapon Test Procedures Manual (TPM) used by weapon test ranges. The TAG also facilitates partnerships and leveraging with Program Managers, Program Executive Offices, and Service Program Offices. These technologies and partnerships have the potential to reduce the number of weapon test articles required and remove labor-intensive activities from weapon testing.
-Maintain, update, and execute strategic roadmaps for underlying vulnerability / lethality models used as standards by the tri-service community to better support JMEM development and Live Fire Testing and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). These roadmaps align JTCG/ME funded and related tasks by other services and programs to facilitate leveraging. In addition, the roadmaps provide a tool for future investment planning to support modeling / simulation validation and resolution of capability gaps. A key roadmap component includes several interconnected model sensitivity studies. The goal of these studies is to understand the range of potential model outputs, including stochastic variations in penetration and other processes, so that differences between test data and predictive models can be better understood. 
This will be used to guide live fire testing requirements for validation of the models for a program office's specific operational envelope. These studies will also provide data to support several model reaccreditations.
-Develop and accredit Collateral Effects Radii (CER) Reference Tables in accordance with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01 series, “No-Strike and the CDE Methodology” for air-to-surface and surface-to-surface weapons, which are the basic data that support the CDE methodology. The JTCG/ME CER tables and CDE methodology are used in every planned kinetic strike in all Areas of Responsibility Operation (AORs) to meet Commanders’ intent and to minimize civilian casualties. As such, it is critical to the Warfighters’ ability to meet urgent operational needs. JTCG/ME implements the CER and CDE methodology within the DCiDE tool. DCiDE is an accredited automated CDE tool that expedites and simplifies the CDE process. DCiDE enables JTCG/ME to continuously support the CJCSI 3160.01 series, DCiDE was the only automated CDE tool authorized for use in the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM AORs. 
-Maintain and support DIEE v2.2.1 product. DIEE is designated by CCMD Action Group (CCAG) as DoD solution for Advanced Target Development (ATD). DIEE provides both seamless planning and linkage to various mission planning systems and tools in operational units. It is a “Government off the shelf” (GOTS) product for advanced target development that integrates Target Coordinate Mensuration (TCM), CDE, Weaponeering, and data basing functions. DIEE was selected as the preferred operational solution of a 2018 Air Force Advanced Target Development (ATD) Software Fly-off based on 135 hours of hands-on time and 451 scored line items. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued guidance stating that, “The Services, Combatant Commands, and Combat Support Agencies will upload and use DIEE v2.1 for automated CDE to comply with the updated methodology and reporting requirement.” DIEE v2.1.1 includes user requested enhancements, more advanced JWS interface for weaponeering capability, CJCSI 3160.01C compliant CER Reference Tables and DCiDE for CDE capability, and updated Common Geopositioning Services (CGS) for TCM capability. A significant update in DIEE v2.2.1 is implementation and integration of mitigation tables for CDE. These mitigation tables, codified for use in CJCSI 3160.01C, are weapon and target specific, and allow for more accurate civilian casualty estimates for consideration by the strike authority. DIEE v2.2.1 supports various mitigation techniques that provide increased operational flexibility within the context of Theater Rules of Engagement and the Laws of Armed Conflict.
-Continue to develop future DIEE versions (v2.x/v3.x) that will include: CGS updates, 3-D viewer for pre- and post- processing of weaponeering and CDE mitigation analyses, interfacing to future JEL capability for weaponeering, updates to Collateral Effects Library (CEL) interface, battle damage assessment workflow and graphic production, route tool user requested enhancements, and mobile tablet capabilities. JTCG/ME maintains Warfighter support and future requirements collection through training and User forums. A focus of FY 2020 efforts will be the transition of CJCSI 3160.01C to CJCSI 3160.01D and the impact on CERs and DCiDE implementation.
-Continue to leverage CEL and other high fidelity weaponeering/CDE techniques to deliver analysis packages for collateral damage mitigation, post-forensic, and force protection analyses packages to operational Users for high value targets in current operations. These efforts directly assist Combatant Commands to meet commander’s intent and minimize collateral damage.
-Continue the Enhanced Weaponeering and CDE Program, a multi-year test program focused on enhancing and validating JTCG/ME CDE tools. This program will support improvements in weaponeering methodology to minimize risk to mission and risk to forces, while not increasing risk of collateral damage, by providing foundational data for the development of higher fidelity predictive tools. Specific efforts will generate buried ordnance characterization data based upon usage statistics from CCMD Expenditure reports, and AOR specific building debris data to enhance and validate current weaponeering/collateral damage estimation methodologies required by Strike Approval Authorities. FY 2020 efforts leverage nine FY 2019 testing events and multiple collaboration forums. FY 2020 tests will include three buried ordnance tests to evaluate the effects of burial and weapon class on warhead performance, crater ejecta, and collateral damage, and four building debris characterization tests. A focused effort of FY 2020 is transition of previous years’ analyzed and processed data to methodologies and future JMEM products.
-Continue to implement the BDA of Deliberate and Dynamic Strikes analysis efforts. These efforts are multi-year task to analyze ongoing strikes required to update JMEM capabilities. The overall objective is to ensure effective and efficient munition expenditure rates and mitigate the stockpile stress, while improving CCMDs’ force effects. This will improve the warfighter's ability to get the right weapon on the right target, achieve the desired effect, and minimize collateral damage while optimizing scarce resources. The analysis approach includes: 1) establishing an analytical cell to provide a detailed and usable Department-level combat assessment of past, current, and future strikes/weapons employments, 2) establishing an archival database that captures the pre- and post-strike assessments of these engagements, in a format that will be called upon by DIEE to select strike packages with optimal and efficient munition expenditures, and 3) guiding tactics improvement for evolving environments and methodology development to improve weaponeering tools. FY 2020 efforts include configuring cloud computing environment for BDA data/web tools, aggregating strike data and migrating to cloud, improving/automating data collection process, developing methodologies for multiple use cases, automating portions of strike analysis methodology, obtaining user feedback on web interface/tools and new BDA requirements, refining interface/tools based on User feedback, and refining accuracy of weapons effects/tools based on BDA results.
-Sustain/support fielded J-ACE v5.3/v5.3.1. J-ACE, which includes the Joint Antiair Model (JAAM) and Endgame Manager (EM) modules. J-ACE provides two-sided air-to-air/surface-to-air combat effectiveness capability to underpin air combat tactics, techniques, and procedures development, as well as support mission analysis, studies, and training. Many users leverage J-ACE’s Application Program Interface (API) to link debrief and analysis tools at training and test ranges across the Joint community. FY 2020 efforts will include multiple training and user forums for the fielded product. These forums are pivotal for J-ACE developers to understand requirements, and align development with other external debrief/analytical capabilities that use J-ACE as the underlying analytical engine to underpin results. The forums allow J-ACE external application developers to receive any updates and interact with J-ACE developer to refine requirements and plans.
-Finish J-ACE v5.4 development. Further J-ACE v5.4 product development will maximize the final J-ACE v5.x product line, and continue to deliver User with new capability, as the future v6.x product is developed/completed. J-ACE v5.4 will include updated weapons and aircraft data in JAAM, new cross platform BROWSE module, which contains descriptive information for each player (weapon, aircraft). In addition, J-ACE v5.4 will include a new EM module that simulates terminal effects of the weapon lethality and target vulnerability. The faster EM has improved speed of new fuze model and refined graphic display data generation, and includes more weapon lethality-target vulnerability data sets. Other capabilities will include time, space, and position information (TSPI) file updates and filtering/error identification, aircraft maneuver updates, new input/output control options for a “war room summary sheet, and initial air-to-surface weapon (ASW) fly out models.
-Further development of the Air Combat Effectiveness Library (ACEL) and the next J-ACE product series capabilities, known as J-ACE v6.x. Future JTCG/ME product lines (applications) are being designed and built on a foundation of effects libraries, which are collections of JTCG/ME approved data, models, and methods/capabilities. Effects libraries are integrated using software frameworks, which support plug-in style methodologies enabling maximum modularity, flexibility of design, and reuse of standard capabilities across the community for greater performance and affordability. ACEL uses Hybrid Interactive Visualization Engine (HIVE) as it software architecture, which is used by others in the aircraft survivability community, enabling greater leveraging. ACEL will serve as the underlying analytical engine for weapons shot-logic/effect and weapons/aircraft kinematic calculations, while J-ACE v6.x and application interfaces will enable Users to interact with and use ACEL capabilities in a tailored software application to predict air combat effectiveness. FY 2020 efforts and deliverables will include continued review/approval of transported v5.x capabilities to ACEL and continued development of new v6.x capabilities. J-ACE v6.0 threshold capabilities include unmanned aerial system features, enhanced weapon engagement zone methodology, new graphical displays, refined terrain masking options, and auto-generated test reports for each product player. J-ACE v6.0 objective capabilities include enhanced air-to-air missile modeling capability, more ASW fly outs, updated/new surface-to-air models, updated enhanced surface-to-air missile simulation (ESAMS) capability with more counter measures, and target detection capability leveraging National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) Radio Frequency (RF) models/data. Longer -lead development items include infrared detection/track, red surf-to-air gun modeling in EM, rotary wing aero performance modeling, and enhanced chaff modeling.
-Continue to mature Cyber JMEM capabilities with continued execution of multiyear plan to develop the COLE tool. FY 2020 efforts will focus completion of capability drop (CD) 2 efforts to include: advanced calculations incorporating quantification of uncertainties, ingest and generate operational environment model (OEM) data, prototype functional and beta tests, advanced uncertainty modeling (Monte Carlo, etc.), and computation of path-to-target estimate. In addition, FY 2020 will begin development of CD 3 that will include automated fusion of multi-domain estimates, correlation of foundational data to support OEM generation, preliminary artificial intelligence-based decision support system, OEM analysis and attack planning support, refined integration with other JTCG/ME toolsets, and quantitative comparisons. Similar to other JMEMs, User feedback is critical. FY 2019 COLE Functional Users Working Group prioritized requirements are driving development for CD 2. FY 2020 will include multiple Working Groups to review development with operators.
-Initialize a JMEM program for EMS Fires. This effort will start in FY 2020 and is in response to Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM) 061-18 requesting Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) for EMS Fires. CCMD mission planners require the ability to employ both kinetic and electronic attack (EA) methods to prosecute/affect advisory targets in contested EMS environments. Mission planners must be able to compare options side-by-side to have confidence in the effectiveness and understand associated risk. JTCG/ME will develop JMEMs capability for EMS Fires allowing mission planners to assess weapon/combat effectiveness in the presence of adversary EA on kinetic weapon guidance systems (i.e., Global Positioning System (GPS) Jamming), and to assess our EA capabilities against adversary targets (i.e., EMS Fires - EA Jamming). JTCG/ME will review and leverage existing models and data sets, were applicable, to build this capability. In addition, JTCG/ME will use kinetic weapon JMEM development model: 1) requirement collection/prioritization via Operational Users Working Groups, 2) Tri-service coordination, 3) leveraging/enhancing existing data/methodology, and 4) Joint standardization/approval. JTCG/ME will look to provide immediate capability, while developing/executing a long-term strategy for sustained JMEMs for EMS fires capabilities to inform the planning and requirements processes. FY 2020 efforts will include 1) developing EMS Fires JMEM strategy and plan, 2) collecting/coordinating requirements, 3) initiation of Tri-service team to review/approve data/methods, formulate processes to codify in charter/terms of reference, 4) further understanding current data sources/models, 5) building partnerships for data collection, 6) executing proofs-of-concepts, and 7) providing initial capability with weapon guides and data collection gaps/shortfalls.</r2:Text>

The FY 2021 budget will enable the LFT&amp;E Deputate to assess the adequacy of LFT&amp;E strategies/plans and generate new LFT&amp;E policies to support systems’ acquisitions and rapid fielding. The FY 2021 budget will ensure an adequate execution of the agreed upon LFT&amp;E plans and subsequently ability to conduct independent analysis of survivability and lethality test and M&amp;S data in support of the development of OSD Live Fire Test and Evaluation reports to Congress.

JLF Programs and LFT&amp;E Initiatives

The FY 2021 budget will support a more lethal force by increasing the accuracy and capability of critical modeling and simulation tools to support test and evaluation efficiency and ensure credibility of DOD assessments and weaponeering tools.  JLF efforts will also resolve survivability and lethality related system design challenges of currently fielded U.S. systems.  Finally, JLF will continue to lead innovation in LFT&amp;E methods to increase LFT&amp;E efficiency and support rapid fielding.

JASP
In FY 2021 the JASP will continue work on at least 25 multi-year RDT&amp;E projects and initiate about 8 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E. The JASP will support the NDS objective to ‘Build a More Lethal Force’ by developing measures to defeat Near-Peer Adversary Threat (N-PAT) radio-frequency and infrared guided threats coupled with quantifiable improvements in digital and hardware in the loop modeling and simulation capability and credibility. Improve aircraft force protection by advancing system hardening against rocket-propelled grenade, small-arms, and high-energy laser threats and increasing threat and flight environmental situational awareness. Reform the DoD for Greater Performance and Affordability by funding the development of more efficient M&amp;S tools and threat models to enable more effective aircraft survivability capability development, test and evaluation. 

The JCAT will continue to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities. The JASP will continue supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors. The JASP will initiate, continue and complete other projects as approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD/DOT&amp;E.

Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness
In FY 2021, JTCG/ME efforts will continue to assist the DOT&amp;E, OSD in supporting the National Defense Strategy lines of effort of enabling greater force lethality, strengthening partner capabilities, and optimal use of resources through efficiency.

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Operational Test Activities and Analyses (OTA&amp;A) programs are continuing efforts that provide management and oversight of test and evaluation functions and expertise to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The OTA&amp;A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).

Joint Test and Evaluation projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide non-materiel solutions that improve:  joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues, development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  New projects are also encouraged to align their efforts to supporting the 2018 National Defense Strategy.  The JT&amp;E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new tactics, techniques, and procedures to improve joint capabilities and methodologies.

Threat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&amp;E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments.  As DOT&amp;E’s agent, Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates, and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&amp;E’s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&amp;E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD (A&amp;S)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&amp;E action officers and other DOT&amp;E activities with program specific threat intelligence support.  Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and the actual development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.

The Center, a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) Activity, directs, coordinates, supports, and conducts independent countermeasure/counter-countermeasure (CCM) T&amp;E activities of U.S. and foreign weapon systems, subsystems, sensors, and related components. The Center accomplishes this work in support of DOT&amp;E, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E), weapon system developers, and the Services. The Center’s testing and analyses directly supports operational effectiveness and suitability evaluations of CM/CCM systems, such as missile warning and aircraft survivability equipment (ASE), used on rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft. The Center develops unique CM/CCM test equipment to support testing in operationally realistic environments. The Center determines the effectiveness of precision-guided weapon (PGW) systems and subsystems when operating in an environment degraded by CMs. Analysis and recommendations on CM/CCM effectiveness are provided to Service Program Offices, DOT&amp;E, DASD (DT&amp;E), and the Services. The Center also supports Service member exercises, training, and pre-deployment activities with expertise on CM/CCM technology and capabilities.

This Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development support and travel funds.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

In FY 2019, JT&amp;E will close one project that started in FY 2016 and two projects that started in FY 2017. The first is the Joint Counterair Integration Joint Test, which closed in November 2018. It developed and tested techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP) for counterair shooter and command and control operators to effectively integrate joint defensive counterair resources in a contested, degraded, and operationally limited environment to protect defended assets from expected threats. The second project is the Joint Cyber Insider Threat Joint Test, which closed November 2018. It developed and tested procedures to proactively detect and respond to cyber insider threats before they have an adverse impact on military operations. The last project expected to close in FY 2019 is the Joint Interoperability for Medical Transport Missions Joint Test, which is anticipated to close in September 2019.  It is developing, testing, and evaluating TTP that enable access to medical information existing in various systems across the DoD and procedures for using that information in the patient movement coordination and validation process.  Two projects that started in FY 2018 will continue through FY 2019. Four new feasibility studies are expected to be conducted in FY 2019 of which two will be selected to conduct joint tests.

Threat Systems
In FY 2019, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions based on the availability of funding. Threat Systems will:
- Continue to support the US warfighter by providing threat intelligence relevant to emerging threats such as artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, robotics, machine learning (ML), quantum computing, lasers, nanotechnology, chemical and biological, directed energy, hypersonic and biotechnology to ensure operational and developmental testing occurs against realistic threat representations, including (but not limited to) threats from both revisionist powers such as China and Russia, threats from rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran, and threats from non-state actors.
- Continue to provide intelligence support to DOT&amp;E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight list and provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary.
- Continue to conduct threat intelligence investigations that support use of innovative technologies in the areas of AI, autonomy, robotics, ML, quantum computing, lasers, nanotechnology, chemical and biological, directed energy, hypersonic and biotechnology being developed by nation states to improve threat representation in the contested domain of air, land, sea, space and cyberspace.
- Continue identifying initiatives to improve cyberspace threat representation and prediction, cyber-economic threats to DoD systems, and scalable cyberspace threat test environments that can interface with cyber test networks.
- Continue identifying initiatives to conduct offensive cyber operations (OCO) and defensive cyber operations (DCO) without significantly impacting critical operational capabilities.
- Continue initiatives to improve satellite and space threat representations.
- Continue to sustain and manage threat modelling and simulation (M&amp;S) to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&amp;E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&amp;E users.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&amp;E needs for foreign materiel, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign materiel requirements for T&amp;E.
- Continue providing DOT&amp;E representative support at the Threat Steering Group (TSG) in the transitioning of the System Threat
Assessment Reports (STARS) to the new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) Report process.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E interests on Acquisition/Intelligence/ Requirement Task Force (AIRTF) and Executive Steering
Group (AIRESG) and provide access to the Intelligence Mission Data Management Analysis &amp; Reporting System (IMARS).
- Manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD
Oversight T&amp;E List by conducting intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets.
- Review validation reports to independently ensure the correct threat data and critical parameters are presented in the report to assess the threat representations’ capabilities to replicate a real world threat system.
- Represent DOT&amp;E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition.
- Oversee legacy DOT&amp;E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management
Center-funded threat system investments.
- Continue ITEAMS efforts leading to the development of new threat systems for T&amp;E.
- Continue reviewing Services’ Threat Systems investments to prevent any duplication of effort and encourage cost savings by the sharing or multi-service use of newly developed threat representations to T&amp;E.
- Continue to foster rapid technological advancements in the areas of threat representation for T&amp;E and threat test resources by incorporating innovative technologies from the intelligence community into threat test assets to provide improved test fidelity and performance at lower cost
Threat Systems will continue its efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models. These activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.

The Center
The Center’s core mission to support T&amp;E of aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) directly leads to a ‘more lethal force’ by enabling the survivability of aircraft in a threat environment. Survivability enables mission success. The Center expects to conduct, analyze, and report on more than 40 tests, with 31 requests for test support already under consideration or planned. Most testing will focus on aircraft survivability, with a focus on Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) and Urgent Universal Needs Statement (UUNS), warning and targeting systems, warfighter training events, and precision guided weapons. The Center will provide the programs with an independent assessment of our data/findings for CM/CCM evaluations. The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&amp;E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 oversight, aircraft survivability, and warfighter training events. Furthermore, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM/CCM-focused training, tactics and procedures (TTP) development. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities. These activities will help to enhance and support the survivability of equipment, aircraft and personnel.  

The Center will continue to build upon Improvement and Modernization (I&amp;M) efforts from FY 2018 to improve T&amp;E capabilities. Specifically the emitters for the missile plume simulators will be upgraded to increase threat fidelity. The Center is undertaking the Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite (JSIS) project to collect threat signature and fly out data to improve infrared-guided threat models.  These models form the basis for a significant portion of ASE T&amp;E.  JSIS reached initial operational capability this year to start initial data collection at threat live fire events. The JSIS full operational capability development will begin this fiscal year.

In addition, the Center supports each Service’s ASE programs with its unique test equipment, which reduces duplicate T&amp;E capabilities.  This benefit, along with the transportability of the Center’s unique test equipment, provides DoD a cost savings that results in ‘greater performance and affordability’. The Center will provide expertise to many organizations, including program offices and other T&amp;E agencies. 

Internationally, the Center will continue to "Strengthen Alliances and attract new partners" through collaborative international T&amp;E efforts. The Center serves as the Steering Committee chair and actively participates in the Air Electronic Warfare Cooperative Test and Evaluation Project Arrangement with Australia, Canada, Great Britain and the U.S. Also, the Center supports international cooperative efforts through direct country-to-country T&amp;E activities and continued involvement in the following groups:  NATO SUB-GROUP/2 and NATO’s Aerospace Capabilities Group 3 (Air Survivability)/Subgroup 2 (EW Self-Protection Measures for Joint Services Airborne Assets). 

Domestically, the Center will continue our involvement in the following panels, committees and working groups:  Joint Expendable Countermeasure (JECM) Integrated Product Team, Multi Sensing Symposia (MSS) Joint Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) Working Group, JASP, Foreign Material Exploitation Working Group, Foreign Material Program T&amp;E Subcommittee, and Joint Countermeasures T&amp;E Working Group (JCMT&amp;E WG).</r2:Text>

As a result of the Defense-Wide Review (DWR), the JT&amp;E Program will be divested by the end of FY 2020.  JT&amp;E plans to complete test projects scheduled for completion in FY 2020 and conduct early close-down of remaining projects providing interim products to the warfighting customer.  JT&amp;E will completely shut down the program by closing facilities, terminating contracts, transitioning government personnel to new jobs in the DoD, and terminating all service Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs)/ Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), and all support contracts.  

JT&amp;E will complete or close down four Joint Test, seven Quick Reaction Tests, and one Special Project.  The four Joint Tests are: Joint Laser Systems Effectiveness, Multi-Domain Unified Situational Awareness, Joint – Hypersonic Strike Planning, Execution, Command and Control, and Joint Interoperability through Data Centricity.  

The seven Quick Reaction Tests are:  Joint Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) Tactical Information Management, Joint Enterprise Data Interoperability, Joint Aviation Multi-Ship Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Survivability Validation, Situational Positioning of LD2 Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) - CONOPS Evolution, Joint Military Application of the Space Environment, Integration of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems into Joint Airspace, and Joint/Interagency - Ground Air Transponder Operational Risk Reduction.  

The Special Project is Joint Alerting for Survivability and Endurability. 

Threat Systems
In FY 2020, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; aligns with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) requirements; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions based on the availability of funding. Threat Systems will:
- Continue to support the reduction in acquisition and test timelines while increasing test capabilities against near-peer threats.

Threat Systems will continue its efforts to continually improve the standards set of threat performance models as the global threat environment evolves. With adequate funding, these activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs and ultimately supports the warfighter.


The Center
The Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems/platforms. Testing will focus on directed energy weapon systems, counter-unmanned aerial systems (CUAS), aircraft survivability equipment (with a focus on Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) and Urgent Universal Need Statement (UUNS) programs), and pre-deployment warfighter training exercises. High priority programs will receive an independent assessment of our data/findings for CM/CCM evaluations. Our support will be distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities. These activities will help to enhance and support the survivability of equipment, aircraft and personnel. 

The Center will build upon improvement and modernization efforts from FY 2019 to improve T&amp;E capabilities. Specifically, the missile plume simulator smart emitter upgrades are expected to be completed by the end of FY 2020. The implementation of JSIS Full Operational Capability (FOC) will add signature instrumentation focused on emerging programs, additional instrumentation to support data collection for multiple, concurrent events, instrumentation to support static live fire events, and full trajectory coverage for missile attitude related data collection. The Center will continue its involvement in the Directed Energy (DE) community as an active participant in the DE Instrumentation Initiative review panel. The Center will also lead the development of the High Energy Laser Remote Target Scoring (HRTS) project and partner with other T&amp;E investment programs.
The Center will continue to support international T&amp;E collaborative efforts. In addition, the Center will continue support of domestic panels, committees and working groups.</r2:Text>

In FY 2021, Threat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; aligns with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) requirements; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions based on the availability of funding. Threat Systems will:
- Continue to support the reduction in acquisition and test timelines while increasing test capabilities against near-peer threats.
- Continue to understand and address near-pear threats (to include cyber) via testing with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and neural networks.
- Complete development of an Advanced Satellite Navigation Receiver (ASNR) for an open service Global Positioning System / Inertial Measurement Unit (GPS/IMU) coupled high-fidelity, high dynamic next generation Time Space Position Information (TSPI) system to support future missile tests and Joint Standard Instrumentation Suite (JSIS) flight testing.  
- Continue to support the US warfighter by providing threat intelligence relevant to emerging threats such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonic and biotechnology to ensure operational and developmental testing occurs against realistic threat representations, including (but not limited to) threats from both revisionist powers such as China and Russia, threats from rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran, and threats from non-state actors.
- Continue to support initiatives for the development of near-pear threat representative jammers, for use in terrain constricted tests as a directional active electronically steered array jammer that will limit Federal Aviation Administration and other common jammer restrictions.
- Continue initiatives to improve satellite and space threat representations.
- Continue to sustain and manage threat M&amp;S to support test and evaluation by overseeing and coordinating intelligence community developed threat models, performing threat model anomaly resolution resolving differences from live fire testing, integrating threat models into T&amp;E facilities and distributing performance and signature models to T&amp;E users.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E at foreign material exchanges, inter-agency coordinating groups, and non-proliferation groups to raise awareness of T&amp;E needs for foreign materiel, coordinate service requirements, and de-conflict and prioritize foreign materiel requirements for T&amp;E.
- Continue to provide intelligence support to DOT&amp;E staff to address specific questions on threat systems affecting programs on the OSD T&amp;E Oversight list and provide briefings and special intelligence reports when necessary.
- Continue to conduct threat intelligence investigations that support use of innovative technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, robotics, machine learning (ML), quantum computing, lasers, nanotechnology, chemical and biological, directed energy, hypersonic and biotechnology being developed by nation states to improve threat representation in the contested domain of air, land, sea, space and cyberspace.
- Continue identifying initiatives to improve cyberspace threat representation and prediction, cyber-economic threats to DoD systems, and scalable cyberspace threat test environments that can interface with cyber test networks.
- Continue identifying initiatives to conduct offensive cyber operations (OCO) and defensive cyber operations (DCO) without significantly impacting critical operational capabilities.
- Continue providing DOT&amp;E representative support at the Threat Steering Group (TSG) in the transitioning of the System Threat Assessment Reports (STARS) to the new Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT) Report process.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E interests on the Intelligence Acquisition Agility Working Group (IAAWG) and Executive Steering Group (ESG) and provide access to the Intelligence Mission Data Management Analysis &amp; Reporting System (IMARS).
- Continue to manage Integrated Technical Evaluation and Analysis of Multiple Sources (ITEAMS) efforts supporting programs on the OSD Oversight T&amp;E List by conducting intelligence “deep dives” to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets.
- Continue to review validation reports to independently ensure the correct threat data and critical parameters are presented in the report to assess the threat representations’ capabilities to replicate a real world threat system.
- Continue to represent DOT&amp;E at the Intelligence Mission Data Oversight Board responsible for development, production and sharing issues affecting the intelligence data supporting weapons systems acquisition.
- Oversee legacy DOT&amp;E investments and continue management and oversight of legacy and new Test Resource Management Center-funded threat system investments.
- Continue ITEAMS efforts leading to the development of new threat systems for T&amp;E.
- Continue reviewing Services’ Threat Systems investments to prevent any duplication of effort and encourage cost savings by the sharing or multi-service use of newly developed threat representations to T&amp;E.
- Continue to foster rapid technological advancements in the areas of threat representation for T&amp;E and threat test resources by incorporating innovative technologies from the intelligence community into threat test assets to provide improved test fidelity and performance at lower cost
Threat Systems will continue its efforts to continually improve the standards set of threat performance models as the global threat environment evolves. With adequate funding, these activities help DOT&amp;E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs and ultimately supports the warfighter.

The Center
The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&amp;E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 oversight programs, DE, CUAS, aircraft survivability, and warfighter training events. The Center expects to increase focus on Directed Energy Weapons and other critical technology areas, which will contribute to the testing of future weapons and the understanding of emerging threats.  The Center’s ability to provide unique test equipment and expertise will remain a benefit to all Services, and the ongoing Improvement and Modernization plans will ensure test capabilities are provided at a cost savings across the DoD. Additional instrumentation, personnel, and training will be key to ensuring our ongoing test support continues to add significance in emerging technology areas.

In FY 2021 The Center will build critical test and evaluation capabilities and the workforce necessary to evaluate emerging Directed Energy Weapon (DEW) war fighting technologies. This includes mobile, open-air DEW data collection and analysis capabilities that will support the test &amp; evaluation (T&amp;E) of the rapid prototyping and fielding needs of these systems. The mobile test capability will allow T&amp;E of operational representative test scenarios in an open air environment to support the accelerated development and fielding of DEW within the DoD.</r2:Text>

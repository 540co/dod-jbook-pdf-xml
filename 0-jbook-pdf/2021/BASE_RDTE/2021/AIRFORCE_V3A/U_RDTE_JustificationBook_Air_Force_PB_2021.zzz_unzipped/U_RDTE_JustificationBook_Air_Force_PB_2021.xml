Additionally, in FY21 PE 0604003F BA 04 (ABMS RDT&amp;E) merges with PE 0304115F MDC2 (also known as Joint All Domain Command and Control, JADC2 RDT&amp;E) to consolidate development activities and provide greater alignment and transparency in execution. See Section D for consolidated funding.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) portfolio develops the digital infrastructure and tools required for the joint force to provide operationally relevant and fieldable capabilities in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS). ABMS addresses gaps in interoperability and information sharing for air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace domains. The ABMS lines of effort accelerate the development, integration, transition, and fielding of technologies that enable Joint All-Domain Command and Control.

ABMS investments are divided into seven categories of activities.

Digital Architectures, Standards, and Concept Development: This includes digital engineering and analysis, model-based systems engineering, and related analyses and exploration in support of potential investments in the other six categories.

Sensor Integration: This includes the development, test, and integration of open architecture sensor system. These systems will be based on government-owned standards and provide open and reusable capabilities, initially focused on air and ground moving target indication (AMTI, GMTI).

Multi-Domain Data Management: This includes cloud-based data libraries, data feeds, data wrappers, and data management to improve data discoverability and information sharing across the joint force. 

Multi-Domain Secure Processing: This includes hardware and software for multi-level security as well as edge hardware to enable a full range of military operations

Multi-Domain Connectivity: This includes maturation and integration of open software-defined radios and networks, government-owned waveform libraries, and wideband multi-function RF systems. This category also includes the integration and standards required to leverage advances in commercial technology such as 5G networks and proliferated low-earth orbit satellite communications. 

Multi-Domain Applications: This includes cloud-based applications to process sensor data, fuse sensor data from multiple platforms across different domains, combine data into a common multi-domain operating picture, and provide battle management, command, and control (BMC2) functionality.

Effects Integration: This includes development and integration of open smart munitions that enable dynamic kill webs, attritable aircraft that generate combat mass and distributed effects, and real-time updates to mission data files to improve electronic warfare system performance. 

The ABMS approach is not a traditional systems acquisition. Instead of acquisition of platforms, ABMS is moving to acquisition of capabilities that are open, available, deployable, and reconfigurable for installation on or use by multiple systems across multiple domains. These capabilities increase the effectiveness and survivability of Air Force, joint, and coalition partners across permissive and contested environments, in all warfighting domains, and at multiple classification levels. ABMS will leverage existing and emerging technology with emphasis on commercial technology and those at technology readiness levels that will enable rapid transition. The innovations from ABMS will augment new and ongoing initiatives aligned with service multi-domain operational priorities. 

ABMS funding provides for operational concept development and demonstration, hardware development and integration, and software development and integration. The funding will also enable the limited transition of mature and ready capabilities to appropriate programs of record in synchronization with planned modernization activities. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JADC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in additional to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.


This is not a new start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>ABMS leverages and complements ongoing efforts and emerging technologies across services, agencies, laboratories, and industry partners. The hardware development approach is based on continuous integration and delivery of incremental capability improvement over time, with emphasis on open and modular systems that can be rapidly transitioned and widely deployed. Software will be deployed using a development/security/operations (DevSecOps) approach with multiple partners. Key points of emphasis include open and reusable software, cloud deployments for scaling and data management, and cyber resiliency. The DevSecOps approach directed by DoD facilitates integration efforts by traditional and non-traditional software providers, with or without prime contractor involvement.

ABMS executes onramp events with a COCOM sponsor every four months. These events show proposed technical solutions across the ABMS product lines, demonstrate capabilities being developed in an operationally-relevant scenario, and have the potential to generate leave-behind capabilities if requested. The participating platforms and COCOMs will vary from event to event. Capabilities developed in the ABMS portfolio will be presented at onramp events as they become ready for demonstration, with multiple capabilities being demonstrated at each event. Each event informs the next development sprint as well as future events while also reducing technology risk. This approach also facilitates rapid integration by making the technology visible and performing initial operationally-relevant testing for a broad COCOM audience. Specific event costs are contained in the JADC2 PE 3040115F (BPAC 673380), formerly known as MDC2, while development costs are contained in the ABMS PE.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and the Department of Defense initiative for joint pilot training.

Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training supports Air Education and Training Command's implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft Training. This program provides and maintains the currency of Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment Desktop Training System.

T-6 Operational System Development continues follow on development activities to JPATS including but not limited to studies &amp; development efforts, instructional courseware, and logistics support to include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources(DMS) and development activities related to DMS. Included is development for the Next Generation On-Board Oxygen Generation System, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out), Crash Survivable Recorder (CSR),Controlled Flight Into Terrain - Prevention (CFIT-Prevention), Pilot Training Next (PTN) and associated upgrades. There are currently 443 aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Remaining service life is up to 39 years from the final delivery in May 2010.

The T-38 program continues studies &amp; development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address DMSMS issues for the T-38 Platform and regular block upgrades for the T-38C as required to keep the system current. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements for the aircraft and aircrew training devices to address flight safety issues and to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Specialized Undergraduate Flight Training capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This effort supports Air Education and Training Command's (AETC) implementation of Undergraduate Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Training (URT). URT produces RPA pilots and Sensor Operators from accession sources to man RPA squadrons. 

Success of the program is heavily dependent on Predator Reaper Integrated Mission Environment (PRIME) Desktop Training System to prepare undergraduate students for entry in RPA Formal Training Units (FTU). PRIME has completed seven Phases of development and is now at baseline functionality. PRIME is a desktop trainer similar to the Reaper training system now in use to train undergraduate RPA pilots and sensor operators. PRIME currently emulates the MQ-9 Reaper and needs to keep pace with that baseline system and expand to other RPAs in order to maintain concurrency and relevancy. Funds will also be used to develop enhancements that increase fidelity and functionality.  

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. 

Implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver URT weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The T-38 is a twin engine, two seat (tandem), supersonic jet trainer used by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as an advanced trainer in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training. Modifications are budgeted to enhance operational capability while improving flight safety, reliability and maintainability. There are currently 503 T-38's in the Air Force inventory (53 T-38A, six AT-38B and 444 T-38C) with five T-38Cs pending removal. T-38s first entered service in 1960 and average over 51 years old.

Studies &amp; development efforts supporting future ACAT III Engineering Change Proposals to address obsolescence issues for the T-38 platform and accomplish the regular block upgrades on the T-38C as required to keep the system current. Block upgrades will be accomplished with Operations &amp; Maintenance funding unless the block upgrade provides additional capabilities. Block upgrades incorporate software and/or hardware improvements to comply with new capabilities mandated by Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, or National Airspace System, and to address flight safety issues. The block upgrades support the T-38C aircraft and Aircrew Training Devices.

L3 Display Systems is unable to continue support of the T-38C Multi-Functional Display (MFD) and the Electronic Engine Display (EED) beyond March 2026.  Development of replacement displays must begin in FY20 to ensure continued AETC pilot production.  There are 2 MFDs and 2 EEDs per aircraft (1,768 displays).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver T-38 Operational systems Development weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Navy, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps and International Partners countries. There are three variants the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant; F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant. Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize total air system life cycle costs. Planning and pre-development systems engineering for Block 4 continues as Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is met for each variant during System Development and Demonstration (SDD).

The JSF Continuous Capability Development &amp; Delivery (C2D2) efforts provide incremental warfighting capability improvements to maintain joint air dominance against evolving threats. Block 4 capability requirements were initiated through ongoing Service-led operational analysis of warfighting gaps identified in the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), and through F-35 JSF Block 4 Mission Decomposition analysis completed in FY 2014. These analyses serve as the basis for the Block 4 (CDD), staffed through the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and signed by the USAF Chief of Staff in January 2015. Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved the CDD 21 March 2017. Modernization activities in FY 2017 and FY 2018 include systems engineering, risk reduction, and infrastructure required to deliver full air system Block 4 capabilities to support initial fleet availability of Block 4 upgrades in FY 2020 with the fielding of Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).

Block 4 efforts include a robust weapons integration portfolio and provide new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements.

F-35 C2D2 provides continuing incremental upgrades of the three F-35 variants and associated ground equipment. Upgrades are essential capabilities for Air Interdiction and Strategic Attack, Close Air Support, Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses, Offensive and Defensive Counter Air and expanded Surface Warfare. The C2D2 acquisition strategy is based upon incremental deliveries of capabilities. The strategy includes periodic deliveries with a focus on hardware, tech refresh and software. C2D2 capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to C2D2. As SDD development activities ramp down C2D2 will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.

The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway are participants in F-35 modernization. The program shown here reflects United States Air Force funding. Total funding for all Service and International Partners is reported at the accomplishment/planned program level since activities support all aircraft variants. Foreign Military Sales are ongoing separately.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-35 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F

PE 0604840F continues funding common requirements for the joint program (US Services and International Partners) previously programmed for in PE 0207142F for common Block 4 requirements beginning in FY 2020.  This is not a new start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

through completion of Developmental Flight Test for all variants of the F-35 aircraft. Modernization efforts include Requirements Decomposition and continuous development and release of capabilities identified as Block 4 upgrades. This is a continuation of the previous Block 4 developmental contracts, which will include activities leading to successful completion of Developmental Flight Test, to include select facility upgrades required for Block 4 research, development, test and evaluation. Included in Block 4 are upgraded capabilities and continuous improvements to maintain Air System viability against evolving threats indicated in the Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICD, and the Block 4 Capability Development Document (CDD), reduce life cycle cost, and improve operational suitability. Continuous risk reduction activities to include Air System Integration, preplanning for subsequent Block 4 Modernization events, and investments to deliver the full Block 4 Air System capabilities as needed. C2D2 capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to C2D2. As SDD development activities ramp down C2D2 will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) continues to deliver the core logistics and maintenance infrastructure requirements for the F-35 enterprise. ALIS includes features such as aircraft scheduling, training delivery, record keeping, technical data delivery, supply chain management, maintenance management, pilot and maintenance debriefing, and mission planning. The ALIS development program is focused on two primary lines of effort: supporting the F-35 enterprise Data Transformation effort and continuously integrating and delivering new capability.

Current ALIS will be replaced with a new system called the F-35 Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN). Led by the F-35 Joint Program Office, ODIN will be developed in a collaborative partnership with government organizations and industry partners. ODIN will be designed from the start with significant warfighter engagement, ensuring that the system fully supports F-35 worldwide operations. Leveraging modern software, data management tools, and processes, ODIN will be a cloud-native system incorporating a government-managed integrated data environment and user-centered applications. The ALIS re-architecture effort that began in FY 2019 will continue under ODIN and complete fielding in FY 2023. ODIN will redesign its software, data, and hardware architecture with a focus on cybersecurity, affordability, resiliency, and supportability.

Under the umbrella of current ALIS, an Agile DevOps pilot was established to rapidly deliver capability updates to the fleet and change the way that current ALIS delivers software.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system.  AFIPPS supports how the Air Force owns and operates the Human Resource Management domain and is a component of the AF/A1 digital transformation journey, currently underway.  AFIPPS continues the transformation by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data to ensure timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances, and benefits to all Active (RegAF), National Guard (ANG), and Reserve (AFRes) components.  AFIPPS represents the AF commitment to modernize business practices and provide enhanced support to service members and their families by integrating personnel and pay systems. AFIPPS will eliminate AF reliance on the end-of-life/unsustainable Defense Finance and Accounting (DFAS) Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) for payroll processing and will ensure continued/improved auditability of service member pay.  

The AFIPPS program will directly increase AF readiness for the total force service members, human resources and financial management specialists and AF Commanders.  AFIPPS will improve the AF communities experience by allowing members to update via self-initiate pay/personnel actions, commencing automated transmission of verified personnel data, decreasing pay errors and providing accurate personnel/pay data for leadership decision making. 

In October 2019, the AFIPPS program revised its release strategy to include two major releases.  The program will leverage a Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) self-service capability deployment to ensure infrastructure for pay and leave capability is in place.  The self-service capability will deploy in Jan 2021, allowing the AF community to initiate self-registration, validate member data and verify operational performance.  The AFIPPS pay and leave capabilities will be released on the backbone of the MilPDS system in Jan 2022 to coincide with domestic and international transactions.  

The FY20 Congressional reduction of 3080 procurement funding leaves program without ability to field pay and leave capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFIPPS capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F. Also, funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development, and mobile application.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>AFIPPS acquisition strategy focuses on expanding the fielded AF Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) by integrating pay and leave capabilities. MilPDS is implemented using the commercial Oracle ERP E-Business Suite (EBS). The AFIPPS program will configure/develop the pay module of EBS and ensure the system is fully integrated and deployed. The Government awarded a contract for the pay system development, test, and deployment. The development activities are fully coordinated and integrated with the on-going operation and sustainment of MilPDS.

In October 2019, the AFIPPS program revised its release strategy to include two major releases.  The program will leverage a MilPDS self-service capability deployment to ensure infrastructure for pay and leave capability is in place.  The self-service capability will deploy in Jan 2021, allowing the AF community to initiate self-registration, validate member data and verify operational performance. 
 
AFIPPS is implementing agile principles to the maximum extent practical during the software development effort. The pay/leave capability will be broken into stories then incorporated into work packages to be developed in three week sprints. Each work package will be developed and tested by the integrated user/developer team on multiple pre-production environments. Once functionality and associated business processes from current payroll and leave systems are integrated and validated against the existing MILPDS baseline, the pay/leave capability will be delivered in a single release. 

The AFIPPS program will release its pay/leave capability to strategically coincide with all domestic and international financial transactions that occur on the first of the year, mitigating any potential impacts to the warfighter. Incremental pay/leave releases to human resource/financial management specialist and total force are not feasible due to the following: 
• Incremental releases require complementary changes to dependent, disparate Legacy IT systems at the same time; changes to those systems requires resources and scheduling for each system owner and management office 
• Business processes cannot be fielded using a mix of newly re-engineered segments with legacy; an end-to-end re-engineered process is required from day one
• Rapid Change Management and Training is required across the AF to accompany each incremental release
• Changes to MilPDS infrastructure require significant lead time with DISA; cybersecurity mandates are additional approvals

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AFIPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment [OUSD(A&amp;S)] has delegated the program's Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the Air Force.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The DoD ATEA is responsible for developing and enforcing AT policy and guidance, assessing AT technologies (hardware and software), maintaining and developing new AT technology assessment capabilities, maintaining and maturing AT laboratory equipment and infrastructure, establishing and maintaining a library of AT technologies, providing security guidance and support mechanisms, providing outreach and education to the DoD AT community, providing intelligence support, and evaluating AT implementations across all DoD acquisition programs, foreign military sales, and direct commercial sales. The AF OPR for AT evaluates AT on applicable AF acquisition programs, FMS, and DCS as well as manages AF AT technology development.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Anti-Tamper Executive Agent weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

AT protects critical program information (CPI) in U.S. weapon systems that may be sold to foreign governments or that could possibly fall into enemy hands on the battlefield. AT protections permit the U.S. to preserve its technological advantage and the combat capabilities of critical weapons systems while supporting the warfighters' mission requirements. Furthermore, AT adds longevity to DoD weapon systems and critical technologies by deterring efforts to reverse engineer or develop weapon countermeasures against the system or system component. 

All DoD acquisition programs, Foreign Military Sales, and Direct Commercial Sales with critical program information (CPI) require a validated AT Plan. The AT program includes resources required for subject matter experts (SMEs) to review AT Plans and conduct AT validation on all DoD Weapon Systems, and perform AT assessments of both commercial off the shelf and government off the shelf products. As technology advances, AT continues to perform AT hardware/software assessment capabilities. These capabilities include the acquisition of specialized equipment, maintenance and/or renovations to support the integration of this equipment, and modifications to new and/or existing laboratory facilities to meet equipment and security requirements.

The DoD ATEA coordinates technology development among the DoD Services/Agencies, National Laboratories, and Industry. The DoD ATEA technology development strategy is to coordinate DoD AT technology development across the Services which fund development of new AT technology, as well as enhance existing AT technology efforts to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and facilitate transition for programs to implement. The AT technology development and enhancement efforts include: advanced AT sensor hardware, secure processing, crypto-analysis, tamper penalties, modifying and developing technology to address vulnerability and susceptibility of fielded parts, and other AT enablers. 

The Air Force AT OPR conducts Anti-Tamper technology development to meet Air Force service needs to mature promising AT technologies to transition to Air Force weapons systems. Technology development priorities are given to those technologies that most benefit AF acquisition programs.  These activities are coordinated through the ATEA as a part of the ATEA technology development roadmap and to coordinate with Navy and Army AT technology development efforts.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The ATEA will coordinate the Technology Roadmap with major Prime vendors. Evaluating their AT CRADA projects is of major importance. The ATEA will also coordinate with the Service AT personnel to foster communication and understand what programs Services are developing for their AT implementation. Emerging research areas such as materials, cryptography and electronic circuits have the potential to bring new AT capabilities with increased processing power, reduced power draw, and smaller form factor. The goal of the research is to mature promising technologies to the point they can be transitioned to a program office or industry for implementation in our weapon systems. Priorities will be given to those technologies that most benefit the DoD AT community.

The Air Force AT Office will fund and manage new technology efforts to protect Air Force critical program information. These new AT technology requirements will be obtained from AF programs and these new AT technologies will then transition to Air Force programs.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>HC/MC-130 Recapitalization provides a Medium lift tanker aircraft to replace and augment the aging USAF fleet of combat rescue HC-130P/N and special operations MC-130E/H/P/W aircraft for the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) forces, and Air Force Special Operation Forces, which are experiencing airworthiness, maintainability, and operations limitations. The HC/MC-130 Recap incorporates production line modifications to the C-130J common/baseline configuration to convert them to the HC/MC model. The program also funds post-production modifications to add special mission systems required for behind-enemy-line operations required of CSAR and Special Operations aircraft.
 
The RDT&amp;E portion of the Recap program funds engineering support and studies to conduct rapid development activities, and develops major "block” upgrades to deliver specific increments of capability in common configurations across the fielded fleet. Currently, Block 7.0/8.1 leverages the baseline C-130J (PE 0401132F) Block 7.0/8.1 upgrade, but funds unique HC/AC/MC-130J integration requirements. The Block 7.0/8.1 project will deliver Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) capabilities required for compliance with evolving international standards, thereby allowing HC/MC-130J aircraft to operate in international airspace. It also incorporates capabilities such as Link-16, a new Flight Management System (FMS), Civil GPS Navigation and Data Link, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder Mode-5, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out (ADS-B Out). 

The HC-130J Block 7.0/8.1 Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) will occur to account for the removal of the MC-130J from the original baseline. HC Block 7.0/8.1 trial kit install (TKI) will begin. The USAF has also decoupled the IFF Mode 5 and ADS-B Out portions of Block 7.0/8.1, to accelerate those requirements and comply with 2020 mandates. The USAF also added a budget line to comply with new communication modernization to include Mobile User Objective System (MUOS), Crypto Modernization, and Saturn and High Frequency (HF) Radio Satellite Communications (SATCOM) mandate.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HC/MC-130J weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F. 

The program may also include any Contractor Manpower Equivalent (CME)/A&amp;AS support deemed necessary to support the program objectives. The HC/MC-130 Recap RDT&amp;E permits the initiation and employment of rapid acquisition authorities to respond to emerging threats and requirements as needed.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The RDT&amp;E portion of the Recap program funds three major thrusts to include but not limited to Continuous Improvement Program, HC Block 7.0/8.1, and Governmental Test.

The HC-130J Recap RDT&amp;E effort integrates Block 7.0/8.1 into a HC-130J, provides program capability updates, studies, and integration with other HC-130J unique modifications. The HC-130J Block 7.0/8.1 program follows the same "Block Upgrade" strategy being used in the C-130J program (PE 0401132F).  
 
The USAF will be fielding the IFF Mode 5, ADS-B Out and Link-16 portions of Block 7.0/8.1 ahead of the remaining 36 capabilities in order to comply with the 2020 mandates.

This program element includes necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver HC/MC-130 Recap Program weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Lockheed Martin is the primary contractor for Research and Development work in support of the HC/MC-130J Recap program.   Block 7.0/8.1 strategy takes the common core Block 7.0/8.1 developed in the C-130J program and integrates it into the HC-130J.  Block 7.0/8.1 will also integrate with HC- unique mods.  The C-130J ADS-B Out program includes all C-130J variants.  

Development work done to date on the HC-130J Recap program has been on Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) and Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contracts.

The Continuous Improvement Program (CIP) acquisition strategy is developed on an as needed basis.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The President's authority and direction are exercised through the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The NCCS is the designated combination of flexible and enduring elements including facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and the structure in which these elements are integrated, all of which are essential for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. These functions are accomplished through the NC3 system of systems.

The NC3 system of systems provides connectivity from the President or Secretary of Defense through the National Military Command System (NMCS) to nuclear execution forces worldwide. To enhance NC3 mission success, the AF formalized AF NC3 elements as a specified AF Weapon System (WS), AN/USQ-225.  Activities funded in this Program integrate legacy systems, ongoing NC3 programs, and future capabilities for the overall AF NC3 WS.  

The AF Nuclear Weapon Center NC3 Integration Directorate (AFNWC/NC) will ensure current, new, and future NC3 capabilities are fully integrated as part of the Air Force's overall effort to sustain, modernize, and recapitalize the nuclear enterprise.  AFNWC/NC will be responsible for integrating NC3 materiel management across Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) to include authority and responsibility for weapon system architecture, weapon system configuration management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, risk management, supply chain management, overall integration, system test, verification, and certification.  AFNWC/NC is responsible for defining, building, and sustaining current and future AF NC3 WS system of systems configuration baselines, and marshaling necessary Supporting Centers in AFMC and other units/agencies in the Air Force and the Department of Defense (DoD) to support and/or accomplish these tasks.  AFNWC/NC will collaborate with AFMC Supporting Centers to champion the full spectrum of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTMLPF-P) efforts, in support of U.S. Strategic Command as the Enterprise Lead for NC3, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment as the NC3 Enterprise Capability Portfolio Manager, and Air Force Global Strike Command as the Lead Command championing NDO requirements for all Combatant Commands. 

This program funds activities for integrating AF NC3 WS materiel, authority, and responsibility for the AF NC3 WS architecture, modeling &amp; simulation, digital engineering, configuration management, risk management, weapon system state-of-health reporting, supply chain supportability and risk management, and overall AF NC3 WS integration, development, system test, verification, fielding, and certification. This program also supports modernization and integration activities associated with Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) initiatives.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NC3 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program funds cyber vulnerability assessments of Air Force weapons systems and critical infrastructure as well as non-recurring engineering for mitigations.  The effort leverages the methodology described in the Air Force Cyber Campaign Plan (CCP) to provide Air Force mission assurance in a cyber-contested environment.  Under the Air Force CCP, the Air Force is accomplishing work mandated by Section 1647 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  and Section 1650 of the FY 2017 NDAA.  Section 1647 of the FY 2016 NDAA directs the Secretary of Defense to complete an evaluation of the cyber vulnerabilities of each major weapon system of the Department of Defense. Section 1650 of the FY 2017 NDAA mandates the Secretary of Defense submit a plan for assessing the cyber vulnerability of critical defense infrastructure and begin assessments of this infrastructure. This funding focuses on aspects of the Air Force CCP that develop processes, products, and people to perform the short term goals of conducting system cyber vulnerability assessments, cyber mitigations, and pilot programs and work toward the long term goal of achieving an enduring cyber resilient Air Force.  The program builds upon existing efforts regarding the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities, and does not duplicate similar ongoing efforts or conduct redundant assessments on systems that have already been evaluated.

In addition, this program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability. It may also include necessary civilian pay expenses required to perform analysis and developmental activities required in support of the transition of weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-52H is a long-range bomber capable of delivering the widest variety of nuclear and conventional standoff and direct attack munitions in the Air Force. The Air
Force plans to fly the B-52H to at least 2050.

The B-52H modernization efforts are needed to perform current and future wartime missions and to ensure relevance, lethality and survivability. Additionally,
modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to
the B-52H weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-52 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2020, Project 671803, B-52 AFMC Test Assets funding is documented in Project 675039, B-52 System Improvement</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 AFMC Test Assets project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.  Funds include cost of one Test Aircraft #60-036 Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) performed at Tinker AFB OK.   

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing manufacturing and material shortage (DMSMS) issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 VLF/LF Moderization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, Re-Engine, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to VLF/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>FY19: B-52 Advanced Target POD MFCD funding is documented in Project 675039 B-52 System Improvements
FY20: A new Project 671807 for B-52 Advanced Target POD MFCD was created 
FY21: $11.116M was incorrectly mapped to the old Project 675039 for ATP MFCD work.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve situational awareness and combat lethality.

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a Program of Record and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing manufacturing and material shortage (DMSMS) issues.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Prior to FY 2020, Project 671810 B-52 AEHF Integration funding is documented in Project 675041 B-52 Bomber Tactical Data Link</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Advance Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Integration SATCOM system provides a survivable, low probability of intercept/detection, high bandwidth system that ensures secure intra/inter-flight and two-way command and control communications in the modern anti-access/aerial denial battle space. This communications upgrade replaces the Military Strategic and Tactical Relay (MILSTAR) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM capability (MILSTAR is nearing system end of life) on the B-52. The AEHF Integration effort will integrate the radio, antenna and system components required to provide two-way EHF communication for the B-52.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As AEHF Integration provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (Link 16, VLF/LF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, CERP, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to AEHF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

Trainers and Upgrades for B-52 AEHF
In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Systems Improvements projects will update existing trainers or use Computer-Based Training (CBT) to add any new systems improvement functionality to meet user training requirements and update/maintain the Systems Integration Lab (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WSTs).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In FY 2021, Project 671807 Advanced Target POD MFCD funding is shown in B-52 Squadrons, Project 675039. 

Correct implementation of funding 
- $11.116M Project 671807 Advanced Target POD MFCD funding 
- $0.050M B-52 System Integration efforts</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>B-52 System Improvements is a comprehensive project to facilitate future capabilities and ensure the B-52's viability in performing current and future wartime missions. The scope of work may include development of an AoA, studies and analysis, a CDD, and/or any other analysis or documentation necessary to establish a POR. Additionally, this project may include airborne integration experiments or demonstrations of emerging technologies. Support of the platform integration efforts are necessary to identify and resolve challenges associated with integrating multiple programs and activities planned for the B-52 fleet.

B-52 AMFC Test Support: The B-52 Test Support (FY19 only) project will provide funding for the test aircraft, manpower, and facilities at the Air Force Test Center located at Edwards AFB, California. This project in FY19 will support the developmental testing and sustainment needs of the B-52 weapon system.

B-52 VLF/LF Modernization: The B-52 VLF/LF Modernization integrates a receive-only, low frequency receiver and antenna subsystem to provide a secure, survivable strategic nuclear communication capability for the B-52.  This project will consist of integrating an existing VLF/LF terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antenna, and the Group B terminal Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. As the VLF/LF provides future communication growth to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.)  as well as other aircraft upgrades (HERC (LRSO),Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB, CERP, etc.) may require studies and/or support for potential impact to VLF/LF.  Funds may be used to procure, test, and field terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD)  
The B-52 Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) Multi-Functional Color Display (MFCD) project consists of a monitor upgrade with a 10 gigabyte Ethernet connection. The current targeting pod display is outdated and experiencing a historic break rate. Additionally, the current monitor does not support current and emerging video resolution improvements of the fielded Sniper and LITENING ATPs. The B-52's ATP is now capable of transmitting HD color and video at a much higher resolution than the current monochrome monitor; this upgrade will improve SA and combat lethality.

B-52 Infrared Missile Warning System - cancelled
The project will complete design, integration, and testing for overseas operations for installation on the B-52.  The current missile warning system was designed in the 1970s and must be replaced to counter current and future threats.  

B-52 Mission Data Recorder
Provides permanent crash survivable flight data recorder information to meet FAA and other regulatory requirements.  Produces digital recordings enhancing aircrew mission reconstruction and release validation in AOR. 

B-52 AFGSC Innovation Hub
Support Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) A5B's efforts to take innovative approaches to B-52 modernization.

Costs include any analysis, documentation, and related expenses necessary to establish a POR and support the B-52 weapon system. Additionally, other costs include PMA and centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements (to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership).

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continue aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) Capability Development Document (CDD), dated 18 March 2004, captures the requirements for a Tactical Data Link (TDL) capability on the B-52. The B-52 TDL provides low latency, jam-resistant situational awareness and C2 communications needed to support in-theater operations and missions. This project will consist of integrating an existing off-the-shelf Link 16 terminal into the B-52. Integration includes Group A wiring, rack and antennae, and the Group B terminal, blanking unit and notch filter LRUs. The TDL terminal will be fully integrated with CONECT. This Line-of-Sight (LOS) Link 16 capability allows the warfighter to utilize this capability by maintaining situational awareness, avoiding threats, and employing an array of weapons. 

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. As the Link-16 upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security requirements (JRE messaging, crypto modernization, etc.) as well as other aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, BSB updates, RMP, CERP, etc.) may require study/support for potential impact to the CONECT and Link-16 system. Funds may also be used for Engineering Development Models (EDMs) as well as testing and fielding terminals.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the B-52 Systems Improvements projects will update existing trainers or use Computer-Based Training (CBT) to add any new systems improvement functionality to meet user training requirements and update/maintain the Systems Integration Lab (SIL) for the Weapon System Trainers (WSTs).

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52H Combat Network Communication Technology (CONECT) acquisition project supports nuclear and conventional operations by upgrading the B-52H fleet with data and voice communications capabilities along with improved threat and situational awareness to support participation in network centric operations. This CONECT modification includes procurement of 74 aircraft kits + 2 EMD kits that will be installed in conjunction with Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM). Ground station mission planning hardware, support equipment, initial spares, and Interim Contractor Support will be procured. Additional initial support/readiness efforts will develop and upgrade B-52H training devices with CONECT functionality. The CONECT training device upgrades provide full CONECT functionality to support aircrew training. The Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) include three B-52H Weapon System Trainers (WST) and two Offensive Station Mission Trainers (OSMT), and the upgrades will also be installed in the Systems Integration Lab (SIL). The Other Government Cost line includes, but is not limited to, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) costs to maintain the production configuration through the identification, review and monitoring of items with high obsolescence risk potential, classification of identified items according to criticality, identification of alternatives and implementation of resolutions. Resolutions may include non-recurring engineering (NRE) and/or replacement costs for DMS components, bridge buys of DMS components until NRE can be completed or Life of Type buys, whichever is most appropriate. Included in the Support Equipment line is the planning for establishment of an organic Depot capability, stand-up of the depot, procurement of depot equipment and procurement of the CONECT ground station. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. 

As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5 Identification, IFF, etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. In order to maintain currency with the latest aircraft configuration, the CONECT project will update existing trainers (using stimulate/simulate/computer-based training or a mix) to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the SIL for the WSTs. In order to assist PDM during after-install checkout and Barksdale AFB and Minot AFB units with maintenance checkout and operational training, a CONECT ground station is being developed. 

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds support Weapons System Trainers for the CONECT program.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may also be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

As the CONECT upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging communication and security requirements (upgrades to the IBR, JRE messages, crypto modernization, etc.) and aircraft upgrades (1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade, Mode S/Mode 5 IFF, etc.) may require study for potential impacts to CONECT. CONECT will update the existing trainers and/or use computer-based training to add CONECT functionality to meet user-training requirements, and update/maintain the System Integration Lab (SIL) and for the WST.  A CONECT ground station, is required in order to assist PDM during after-install checkout, and provide Barksdale/Minot units with maintenance checkout and operational training capability.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The GPS IU Upgrade program will provide increased throughput and memory capacity by replacing the current processor, static memory, and necessary associated electronics with a newer processor, more memory, and sustainable electronic packages. This program will replace six Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) which include combining three Circuit Cards into one Input/Output (I/O) CCA. The Backplane and Motherboard will require an upgrade to integrate the new CCAs: the Central Processing Unit / 1553, the power supply CCA, and the video graphics cards. The Input/Output CCA will combine the Discrete Inputs Analog, Audio Video (DAAV), Discrete Outputs (DOA) and Serial Busses functionality. This upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU. 

In addition the new GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements: Which include two Ethernet Ports and two connectors on face-plate for future growth. 

The GPS IU integrates GPS Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) data into navigation, communications, and weapons systems on board the B-52.  The GPS IU acts as a controller for a MIL-STD-1553 data bus communications path.  The major areas of support include GPS interface control and monitoring, targeting pod functions, navigation displays for the Pilot and Copilot stations, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) control functions.

Originally developed with a 33MHz processor with 4MB of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), the GPS IU has become overloaded as more software has been added to the B-52.  Currently operating at 86% throughput capacity and at 90% memory capacity, exceeding the designated safety threshold of 95% memory load in 2019.  The GPS IU is also facing parts obsolescence issues.  Studies show that the current spares will be exhausted by 2020.  The upgrade will improve system reliability and address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues on subcomponents of the IU.  The modified GPS IU will retain the existing functions and interfaces of the legacy GPS IU, and provide additional interfaces to allow for future growth requirements.

GPS IU requires upgrading to incorporate any other GPS dependent capabilities on the B-52 platform.  B-52 fleet will have the capability to carry additional GPS dependent weapons and targeting pods, and the increased capacity to incorporate future GPS-dependent capabilities beyond 2018.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) and Development Testing (DT)/ Operational Testing(OT) issues. 

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Radar Modernization Program (RMP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current APQ-166 radar on the B-52H aircraft. The APQ-166 system will be increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the current failure rate of the APQ-166 places long-duration missions at risk. This modernization program will encompass the radar antenna array and up to 14 individual LRUs that comprise the entire radar system. Development, production and installation of new components and systems to replace the legacy equipment; to be installed on all 76 B-52H aircraft. RMP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire, to the maximum extent possible, previously developed Radar systems and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability of the radar system and the capabilities for new missions. This Radar Modernization Program will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons and to perform mission-essential navigation and weather avoidance functions. In addition, applicable training devices for the new radar subsystem must also be developed, modified and/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. 

This upgrade will affect all three Weapon System Trainers (WST), the WST Training Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL), and both B-52 Offensive Station Maintenance Trainers (OSMT). As the RMP upgrade brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear certification, cyber security, program protection, crypto modernization, etc.), increased radar integration (advanced targeting pod, mission planning, open mission systems considerations, crew vehicle interfaces and Electronic Warfare System), as well as other aircraft upgrades (e.g., Link 16, EHF, 1760 IWBU, Mode S/Mode 5, IFF, GPS/INS, BSB, Re-Engine, EWS, etc.) may impact the RMP. Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life/obsolete software/hardware within the weapons system and simulators systems enabling a move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative may also be required. Additionally, funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and nuclear/conventional mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This program will include projects to facilitate future B-52 capabilities.  Scope of work may involve, but is not limited to, Avionics, Navigation, Situational Awareness (SA) and Defensive Systems.  Additionally, develop and integrate emerging technologies for specialized B-52 missions to include Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Targeting and Weapons. Additionally, this funding also includes future prototyping efforts.  

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Additionally, implementation requirements and standards are defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice DMSMS issues. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>B-52 CERP is a Middle Tier Section 804 program and not an MDAP.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP) supports nuclear and conventional operations by replacing the current TF33-PW-103 engine on the B-52H aircraft. The TF33-PW-103 engine is increasingly difficult to sustain due to diminished manufacturing sources and obsolescent technologies; the AF Propulsion Directorate projects the engine will become unsustainable by 2030. This sustainment program will replace the current TF33-PW-103 engine with jet engines of similar size, weight, and thrust characteristics. The development, production and installation of new engines and related subsystems will replace the legacy equipment on all 76 B-52H aircraft. B-52 CERP will take advantage of advances in technology and on-going development efforts to acquire engines and integrate them into the B-52. The use of new technology will increase both the overall reliability/maintainability of the propulsion system and produce additional electrical power generation capabilities for emerging requirements. The B-52 CERP will allow the operational command (AF Global Strike Command) to fully utilize the capabilities of the B-52H aircraft to employ an array of nuclear and conventional weapons while saving fuel and extending the range/loiter capabilities of the aircraft. In addition, applicable training devices for the engine throttles and engine health monitoring subsystem must also be developed, modified and/or upgraded in conjunction with the aircraft modifications. This upgrade will also require corresponding modification of the Weapon System Trainers (WST).  As B-52 CERP brings additional capability to the B-52, emerging security/certification requirements (nuclear hardening, cyber security, program protection, etc.) will also need to be addressed.  Several concurrent aircraft upgrades during the CERP may necessitate the construction of facilities or facility upgrades/modification. In addition, it may necessitate studies be performed to determine optimal engine installation and deployment options.

Cost includes any other analysis or documentation and related expenses necessary to establish a program of record and support the B-52 Weapon System.  Cost includes Program Management Administration (PMA) costs, centralized support and initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts to improve weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, reliability, and total cost of ownership.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AGM-86B, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), is a subsonic, air-to-surface strategic nuclear missile, operational since 1982.  Armed with a W-80 warhead, it is designed to evade air and ground-based defenses in order to strike targets at any location within any enemy's territory.  The ALCM is designed for B-52H internal and external carriage. 

RDT&amp;E funds support development of new tests and evaluation procedures, software, and equipment.  RDT&amp;E funds also provide sustainment solutions for Line Replaceable Units (LRU) and technology insertion to ensure ALCM sustainability supports Air Force strategic nuclear deterrence and Global Strike mission requirements through 2030.  Additionally, RDT&amp;E funds support aging and surveillance analysis to pro-actively identify components which will degrade system reliability.

The ALCM Test Plan Development and Evaluation program develops plans and procedures for testing nuclear systems, and implements those procedures as directed by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and to satisfy the recurring requirements to test Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) susceptibility.

An extensive Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is in place to address age related issues and to ensure reliability and sustainability through 2030. Technology insertion is anticipated to address serviceability of components at or near end of life. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ALCM weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Previously, the Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) was assessed in the nuclear environment for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Survivability for High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and Total Ionizing Dose at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). 

Follow-on test development will assess the neutron and gamma component in the nuclear environment for CBRN survivability. Test development and execution will utilize organic and contractor agencies. 

INE SLEP plans for a three phase reliability assessment with comprehensive plan to address short and long term supportability.
Phase 1 - Short-term parts shortage mitigation analyses with Tomahawk Reference Measuring Unit and Computer
Phase 2 - Definition of scope of efforts and establishing the manufacturing methodology
Phase 3 - Delivery of working engineering samples, certification of production, and production of INE's equal to the function and reliability of 'like new' devices</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-1B Lancer is a swing-wing, supersonic, long-range conventional bomber. It carries the largest payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the AF inventory. The multi-mission B-1B is the backbone of America's long-range conventional bomber force and can rapidly deliver massive quantities of precision (and non-precision) weapons against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time.

The B-1B modernization projects alleviate aircraft obsolescence issues due to Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) while at the same time providing improved capabilities to the B-1B weapon system that require significant hardware and software development and testing.

The Fiscal Year 2021 President's Budget retires 17 B-1 aircraft, bringing the total aircraft inventory to 45.

FULLY INTEGRATED TARGETING POD (FITP)- (Air Force terminated program 2QFY20)
The Fully Integrated Targeting Pod (FITP) modification permanently integrates the Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) capability into the B-1B's avionics flight software architecture and replaces the B-1B's Temporary T-1 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) / Laptop Controlled Targeting Pod (LCTP) system with a digital, high-definition video-streaming targeting pod. This will provide increased B-1B aircrew situational awareness, weapons de-confliction, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF). FITP will provide robust combat targeting processing power, computing speed and throughput for aircrew mission planning, and a permanent sustainment support structure. It will provide all four crew members access to targeting pod information displayed on digital-quality video using the Integrated Battle Station (IBS), Multi-Function Displays (MFDs), and the cursor controller. FITP will address the aircrew ergonomic issues caused by the current system configuration, allowing more rapid prosecution of targets through improved integration with Avionics Flight Software (AFS) capabilities. In addition, FITP will provide growth capability for implementation and interaction with follow-on systems to augment targeting pod use. Furthermore, the FITP removes the need for an Interim Contractor Support (ICS) sustainment support structure, which will resolve DMS issues.

MODE 5/S 
B-1B Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S is the replacement for the B-1B Mark XII IFF Mode 4. Mode 5, which will replace Mode 4, will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for combat identification. Mode Select (Mode S), replacing Mode C, provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for aircraft, Air Traffic Control, and the Air Defense System . The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid the loss of B-1B aircraft through fratricide. Mode S provides accuracy required in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airspace. Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 2020 mandate. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

RADIO CRYPTO COMPLIANCE 
The B-1B Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by a classified need date. If the requirements are not met, the B-1B is at risk of losing secure Line of Sight (LOS) and BLOS communication with ground and air forces. The program replaces the existing radios with crypto-compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

MULTIFUNCTIONAL INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (MIDS) - JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEMS (JTRS)
The B-1B Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) - Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) replaces the existing MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) 1 Link 16 terminal to meet National Security Agency (NSA) Crypto Modernization (CM) Device Cease Key and FAA/NTIA Frequency Remap mandates. Current systems become non-compliant in 2025. MIDS-JTRS resolves all LVT 1 deficiencies and adds substantial combat capability enhancements to Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (LET) and Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN-4) with Concurrent Retention Receive (CRR). MIDS-JTRS also provides multi-datalink capability, improving situational awareness and allowing rapid in-flight re-targeting in a cooperative combat environment. Funds are included to accommodate DoT/DoD-approved Frequency Remap and Crypto Modernization Device Cease mandates as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.

BOMB RACK UNIT 56 (BRU-56) 
The Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) upgrade will mitigate a safety risk present within the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use has resulted in a deficiency of the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency led to multiple failures, to include one Class A mishap in 2003, one Class C mishap in 2010, and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification guards against future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.

GAP AND INTEGRATION ANALYSIS
Program funds cover engineering/planning studies, related engineering efforts, and the auxiliary equipment needed for development projects that have not yet been fielded. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and DMS issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA (or other) mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. Costs includes Program Management Administrative (PMA) costs, total ownership cost, as well as initiatives for anticipated weapon system enhancements, to include efforts for improving weapon system operational capabilities, safety, supportability, maintainability, and reliability. All B-1B development projects support planned requirements for unique identification in their production phases. Funding is also required to ensure test asset availability for testing of aircraft RDT&amp;E efforts. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-1B weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Mode 5, which will replace Mode 4, will provide secure target identification and will be a response system for combat identification. Mode Select (Mode S), which will replace Mode C, provides timely aircraft position and flight path prediction to receiver units for aircraft, Air Traffic Control, and the Air Defense System. The IFF Mode 5 upgrade uses an automated system that responds to interrogations to avoid the loss of B-1B aircraft through fratricide. Mode 5 is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) 2020 mandate. Mode S is required in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airspace. Failure to meet these mandates will result in delayed/denied service of controlled airspace within the US and Europe. Program was de-scoped to remove ADS-B requirement based on several factors including Operations and Emission security (OPSEC/EMSEC) concerns.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The B-1B Radio Crypto Compliance requirements originated to meet DoD mandates by a classified need date. If the requirements are not met, the B-1B is at risk of losing secure Line of Sight (LOS) and BLOS communication with ground and air forces. The Air Force is in the process of negotiating a short-term waiver to the mandate. Without the radio crypto compliance the B-1B will not be able to participate in CONUS/OCONUS military operations. The program replaces the existing radios with crypto compliant radios providing BLOS communications. Funds are included to accommodate the DoD mandate as outlined in previous AF and DoD budget exhibits.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Bomb Rack Unit 56 (BRU-56) upgrade will mitigate a safety risk present within the legacy BRU-56 ejector rack. The upgrade will alleviate the deficiency within the current ejector rack as well as add increased carriage capability. Prolonged use has resulted in a deficiency of the rivets within the linkage of the rack. This deficiency led to multiple failures, to include one Class A mishap in 2003, one Class C mishap in 2010, and multiple ground mishaps. The BRU-56 modification avoids future bomb rack mishaps and the possibility of a catastrophic aircraft loss as well as the loss of life.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Mode 5/S acquisition strategy is an Undefinitized Contracting Action (UCA) definitized on 7 Jan 20 as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) with a 2 year Period of Performance for the initial 18 aircraft. Production will begin in Jan 20 with the procurement of kits for the 10 production aircraft using the contract awarded on 7 Jan 20. There is a one-year lead time for kits. Installation will begin as soon as kits are delivered (one year after order). Projected to have 18 aircraft modified with Mode 5 by March 2021. The remainder of the fleet will modified using a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) competitively-selected contract.

Radio Crypto and MIDS-JTRS acquisition strategies will be a CPFF sole source contract with a five+ years EMD effort and a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) competitively-selected contract with a two-year Production and Installation effort for increment one (meets mandates).

BRU-56 acquisition strategy is a single award C-type contract that was competed under FAR Part 15 utilizing source selection procedures for the hardware portion of this effort.  The software portion of this effort is sole source to Boeing (OEM).  EMD will be a two year effort and Production will be a two and a half year effort.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, and support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance man-hours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low
density fleet.

The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) is a non-integrated system that provides SATCOM connectivity for Command and Control enroute to the target. A critical capability is the ability to receive Airborne Mission Transfer (AMT) and Beyond Line-of-Sight Situational Awareness. This effort includes improvements to the suite of B-2 ACS UHF communications system in order to become part of the baseline configuration, as well as modernization upgrades to conform to mandates.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. Integration of the Joint Air-to-Surface Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon will further enhance the B-2s ability to attack and destroy high value target sets.

The Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) program supports the B-2 ability to penetrate anti-access combat environments, performing missions directed by the National Command Authority while ensuring aircrew survivability. The LOSSM program reduces low observable (LO) maintenance, and stabilizes and improves the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet.

The B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) provides a more capable Flight Data Recorder (FDR) with increased capacity for storing Flight Information Data (FID) for recovery and use in the event of a mishap.

The Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS) is planned to be a software only solution implemented in several B-2 system level Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) to provide radar-aided enhanced targeting capability through weapon hand-off navigational updates for guided nuclear weapons in a non-GPS environment.

The B-2 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S modification program replaces the current IFF transponder with a new Mode 5 and Mode S capable transponder ensuring compliance with DoD Combat Identification mandates and global Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements. Mode 5 is the DoD standard for secure combat identification and provides improved discrimination between closely spaced platforms, while reducing interference with civil air traffic control transponders, enabling the B-2 fleet to accomplish its anti-access and global strike mission. Mode 5 replaced the obsolete Mode 4 combat identification. Mode S is a civil air traffic control secondary surveillance radar process that allows selective interrogation of aircraft according to the unique 24-bit address. Mode S provides improved accuracy and altitude resolution and reduced interference from closely spaced aircraft through selective interrogation of assigned transponder addresses.

The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification.

In FY 2020 and prior, the B-2 DMS-M effort is documented in PE 0605931F B-2 DMS, Project 653844 B-2 DMS; beginning in FY 2021, this effort is documented in PE 0101127F B-2 Squadrons, Project 675345 B-2 Modernization.
 
The FY 2021 budget reflects a significant restructure of the B-2 DMS-M program that reduces the program scope to modernize the B-2 display functionality including the multi-function display units (MDUs) and Advanced Graphics Processor (AGP) of the baselined DMS-M program. The legacy display sub-system lacks the processing power to provide necessary situation awareness. In addition, the legacy MDUs are not supportable due to obsolescence and repair issues which will severely impact future aircraft availability. 
 
During B-2 DMS-M Displays development, the engineering baseline will be finalized and production representative kits will be purchased to support software development, platform integration, integrated development/operational test, pre-Milestone C production assessment, and B-2 nuclear certification testing.  Diminishing manufacturing sources and materiel shortages for affected components will be addressed to protect the planned production program by mitigating unplanned part redesign and requalification risks.  This effort will also require investment in systems engineering and software development to integrate the AGP into the B-2 current architecture that includes the legacy Threat Emitter Locator system and associated displays. The program will ensure the most efficient restructure minimizing rework from the baseline DMS-M program.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The B-2 is currently undergoing modernization of avionics/communications systems, engines, armament systems, low observable components, core training system components, aircraft supportability improvements, and support equipment development.

The Air Force will also study multiple structural, avionics, and engine modifications that could improve the performance of the aircraft and engines and reduce maintenance man-hours and the logistics footprint of the fleet. Focus of the studies will be on non-mission capable (maintenance) drivers, safety issues, and obsolescence issues through modernization of key components in the airframe, avionics, and engines resulting in improved aircraft availability of a high demand/low density fleet.

Modern communications are key enablers for the B-2. The Adaptive Communication Suite (ACS) provides baseline improvements to the B-2 ACS UHF SATCOM communication system in order to modernize the system and increase data throughput to support key mission enablers such as AMT, weather, and intelligence updates.

B-2 Armament upgrades integrate new and/or advanced weapons on the B-2 to attack a wider array of target sets, to include hardened, deeply buried targets, as well as destroy more targets per sortie. Integration of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapon will further enhance the B-2's ability to attack and destroy high value target sets. 

The Low Observable Signature and Supportability Modifications (LOSSM) program supports the B-2 ability to penetrate anti-access combat environments, performing missions directed by the National Command Authority while ensuring aircrew survivability. The LOSSM program reduces low observable (LO) maintenance, and stabilizes and improves the combat-ready LO signature for the B-2 fleet. This program encompasses multiple improvement projects including, but not limited to, improved LO materials (electrically conductive materials, adhesives, electrically resistive materials, radar absorbing material, fastener fills, coatings, welds, material removal tools, and improved processes), LO structures (radar radomes, antennas, hot trailing edges and tiles, intermediate section doors, tailpipes, windows, lib bay panels, leading edge, permanent fasteners, exhaust pockets, gust load alleviation system, inlets, radar absorbing structures, overall signature stability, and Alternate High Frequency Material expansion), and radio frequency (RF) diagnostic tools, evaluation systems, and other tools (Tier One Material Inspection System, Signature Diagnostic System, next generation Tier II and Tier III systems, Test Article 0998 optimization, conductivity probes, tailpipe inspection tools, LO-related special test equipment, data archival, and communications tools).

The B-2 Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU) provides a more capable Flight Data Recorder (FDR) with increased capacity for storing Flight Information Data (FID) for recovery and use in the event of a mishap. The initiative includes replacement of the current CSMU with an adapted Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) replacement, modification of the Flight Data Recorder Processor (FDRP) to provide 28 vdc power to the new CSMU, modification of the FDRP Operational Flight Program (OFP), and addition of a Underwater Locator Beacon (ULB). The current CSMU/FDRP does not meet the minimum requirements specified in the Aircraft Information Program (AIP) reference documents (AFI 63-133 and AFH 63-1402).

The B-2 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5/S modification replaces the current IFF transponder with a new Mode 5 and Mode S capable transponder ensuring compliance with DoD Combat Identification mandates and global Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements. Mode 5 is the DoD standard for secure combat identification and provides improved discrimination between closely spaced platforms, while reducing interference with civil air traffic control transponders, enabling the B-2 fleet to accomplish its anti-access and global strike mission. Mode 5 replaced the obsolete Mode 4 combat identification. Mode S is a civil air traffic control secondary surveillance radar process that allows selective interrogation of aircraft according to the unique 24-bit address. Mode S provides improved accuracy and altitude resolution and reduced interference from closely spaced aircraft through selective interrogation of assigned transponder addresses.


The B-2 Training System upgrades include updates to training device hardware and components, simulation software, courseware and academic materials, instructional system design architectures, engineering drawings, and system documentation that is not driven by a funded aircraft modification. Upgrades may include Diminishing Manufacturing Sources efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Additional Training System Upgrades may also include efforts to implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

The Radar Aided Targeting System (RATS) is planned to be a software only solution implemented in several B-2 system level Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) to provide radar-aided enhanced targeting capability through weapon hand-off navigational updates for guided nuclear weapons in a non-GPS environment.  Funding supports timely software development, test and roll-out of software into a future B-2 OFP, specifically to support the B61-12 integration.

In FY 2020 and prior, the B-2 DMS-M effort is documented in PE 0605931F B-2 DMS, Project 653844 B-2 DMS; beginning in FY 2021, this effort is documented in PE 0101127F B-2 Squadrons, Project 675345 B-2 Modernization.
 
The FY 2021 budget reflects a significant restructure of the B-2 DMS-M program that reduces the program scope to modernize the B-2 display functionality including the multi-function display units (MDUs) and Advanced Graphics Processor (AGP) of the baselined DMS-M program. The legacy display sub-system lacks the processing power to provide necessary situation awareness. In addition, the legacy MDUs are not supportable due to obsolescence and repair issues which will severely impact future aircraft availability. 
 
During B-2 DMS-M Displays development, the engineering baseline will be finalized and production representative kits will be purchased to support software development, platform integration, integrated development/operational test, pre-Milestone C production assessment, and B-2 nuclear certification testing.  Diminishing manufacturing sources and materiel shortages for affected components will be addressed to protect the planned production program by mitigating unplanned part redesign and requalification risks.  This effort will also require investment in systems engineering and software development to integrate the AGP into the B-2 current architecture that includes the legacy Threat Emitter Locator system and associated displays. The program will ensure the most efficient restructure minimizing rework from the baseline DMS-M program.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver B-2 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Baseline Support maintains and upgrades the B-2 unique flight test aircraft as well as hardware/software and test equipment to support developmental systems integration, and flight test, reducing the need for additional operational aircraft and accelerating deployment of advanced operational capabilities to the warfighter. Baseline Support also provides for other B-2 unique government costs and includes assorted studies of aircraft performance and cost trades as well as acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future aircraft, engine, weapon, communication, navigation or other capabilities.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0101213F, project 672983, LGM-30G  Airborne Procedures Trainer Replacement (APT-R), is a new start.

In FY 2019, Project 672983, MM Ground and Comm Equipment - LGM-30G Air Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R) was terminated and efforts were transferred to Program 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, and LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU) was completed.
In FY 2020, Project 672983, MM Ground and Comm Equipment - LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remove Visual Assessment Phase II (RVA II) were completed.
In FY 2019, Project 672985, MM Support Equip - LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), and LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU) were completed.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The MM Ground and Comm Equipment program replaces obsolete/unsupportable ground-based weapon system equipment located at Launch Control Centers (LCCs) and Launch Facilities (LFs) necessary to continue Minuteman III (MM III) operations through 2030. Current efforts include development, qualification, integration, and testing of replacement equipment such as the LGM-30G Automatic Switching Unit (ASU), LGM-30G Fast Rising B-Plug Service Life Extension Program (FRBP SLEP), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Break-In-Kit (LCCB), LGM-30G Launch Control Center Block Upgrade (LCCBU), and LGM-30G Remote Visual Assessment II (RVA II), and LGM-30G Airborne Procedures Trainer Replacement (APT-R).

MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data.  Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls.  Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Arm/Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR) and LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to GBSD. As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program.  MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities. Efforts also include any minor needs required to prepare for full acquisition purposes. 

MM Support Equipment program designs, develops, and tests replacement of obsolete/non-serviceable weapon system support equipment. These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Current efforts include design, development, and testing of support equipment such as LGM-30G Control Monitor Procedure Trainer Upgrade (CMPT), LGM-30G Transporter Erector Replacement Program (TERP), LGM-30G Payload Transporter Replacement (PTR), LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU), and LGM-30G Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer/G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA/G6B4 BER).  Programs may execute DMS/PMA support through the ISC 2.0 contract established to support the ICBM enterprise through the life of MMIII. 

MM Crypto Mods executes USSTRATCOM, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Air Force Safety Center requirements by implementing the KS-60 capabilities in LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) of remote key/code change and irreversible transformation as mandated in the approved Capabilities Development Document (dated 4 Jan 05) and addresses Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group Operational Safety Review requirements 98-2, 00-1 and 02-2. It also incorporates continuous signal lockout capabilities to prevent the widespread loss of status monitoring. These features will greatly increase security during code changes by reducing the frequency of open sites 75 days annually and will reduce associated resource costs for 450 Launch Facilities (LFs) and 45 Launch Control Centers (LCCs).

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Minuteman Squadrons nuclear weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

The requirement for air-based, survivable launch capability will be fulfilled through an alternative path: a dual-capable Secondary Launch Platform - Airborne, under the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program. The GBSD program is budgeted in PE 0605230F, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.

The purpose of the ALCS-R program was to design, develop, produce and deploy a replacement for the legacy nuclear command and control system that provides the capability to launch Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from an airborne platform, currently the Navy E-6B, as well as consider future alternate launch requirements. The legacy system consists of a nuclear hardened radio and MM III interface at each Launch Facility, and a suite of launch and cryptographic equipment that generates and transmits commands from the E-6B. ALCS dependent on the Strategic Air Command Code Processing System for codes data supplied to airborne equipment, and the Navy E-6B radio Command, Control, and Communication data path to transmit signals to the Launch Facilities.</r2:Description>

The ASU is controlled by the MPP, which contains software and electronics to measure incoming and standby power characteristics. The DEU provides standby power in the event of a loss of the primary power source. Current equipment and lack of repair/reprogram capability causes inadvertent source transfers by the MPP. Technical data does not exist for repair or reprogramming of the MPP making it unsupportable. The ASU contacts have exceeded their service life, and unnecessary source transfers stress mission critical components. The increased power transfers have increased the use and accelerated the wear on the DEU.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The Airborne Procedures Trainer- Replacement (APT-R) will replace a one-of-a-kind simulator located at Offutt AFB NE that was destroyed by the March 2019 flood.  APT-R program will design, develop, produce, and deploy a trainer used to certify the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) crews on missile launch procedures, emergencies, malfunctions, and in-flight operations as well as Nuclear Certification training.   

APT-R program will use spiral development off of the temporary training solution Virtual APT, which was awarded in October 2019.  The development effort will upgrade the temporary solution to a certified system with  an improved realistic training environment.  The increased capability will include configuring APT-R as a Class 1 training device, incorporating tactile functionality, designing realistic E-6B Mercury aircraft enclosure, developing audio buffer, and augmentation of the instructor touch panel.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>MM III Baseline Support program replaces or upgrades obsolete/unsupportable flight test unique equipment installed on the missile during flight test, used to test MM III systems on the ground, or located at test facilities to collect, process, and analyze test data. Flight test equipment supports test and evaluation of MM III capabilities, and MM III Operational Test Launches (OTLs) to determine ICBM force readiness, reliability and capability shortfalls. Efforts include development, qualification, integration and testing of replacement equipment such as LGM-30G Arm Disarm Switch Replacement (ADSR) and LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3). These programs will also implement processes, procedures and data systems to mitigate the transition risk from MM III to Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). As other similar equipment is identified for replacement, it will be added to this program. MM III Baseline Support also provides for other MM III unique government costs, studies of system performance, contract closeout costs, cost trades and acquisition planning activities, up to and including proposal preparation, for future capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The ADSR program designs, develops, fabricates and tests replacements for the aging Arm/Disarm (A/D) switches currently on the MM III Missile fleet. The A/D switch is responsible for completing or interrupting ordnance electrical circuits. A/D switches are placed at five key locations in the system: Interstage I-II, Stage II Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control (LITVC) and Roll Control, Interstage II-III, PSRE Staging, and PSRE Isolation Valves. Aging and surveillance is an ongoing study to generate a trade-off curve between reliability/availability and cost. 

Reliability/availability are monitored by periodic testing to discover unforeseen issues. Because not all existing A/D switches can be repaired/refurbished, the number in inventory will eventually be inadequate to meet the need of the PDM cycle. Supply is estimated to deplete by approximately FY24 with repair/refurbish mitigation. Repair/refurbish is a reliable mitigation plan to meet the ongoing needs of the fleet while a manufacturer is selected and the manufacturing system is selected to develop a replacement A/D switch that meets requirements and production quantities through 2036.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Flight Test Telemetry and Termination System (FT3)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The FT3 Program replaces the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer (Mod 7) and associated Signal Conditioner Monitor Group, and All Ordnance Destruct System (AODS) with a flight test kit. In addition, a replacement of the Launch Support System (LSS) is required to deploy the flight test kit. The flight test kit which consists of the Flight Destruct System (FDS) and a wafer-less Integrated Instrumentation System (IIS), along with an upgraded LSS, will meet 30th Space Wing Range Safety and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) requirements and resolve obsolescence concerns/issues.

The AODS, Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer, and LSS include many components that are not economically available, are no longer compliant with applicable Range Safety requirements, or are in need of technical modernization. Replacement of the Vandenberg Air Force Base flight test unique equipment is necessary to sustain future AFGSC Operational Test Launches (OTL), supporting USSTRATCOM requirements starting in FY22. 

The OTLs are critical to validating the continued accuracy and reliability of the MM III ICBM Weapon System until Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) is fielded by providing valuable data to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. The FT3 System of Systems (SoS) will perform the same function as the existing systems with upgraded design features in order to comply with Air Force Space Command Manual (AFSPCMAN) 91-710, Range Safety User Requirements, Range Commander's Council 319, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard, and RCC-324, Global Positioning and Inertial Measurements Range Safety Tracking Systems' Commonality Standard.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Pendulous Integrated Gyroscopic Accelerometer/G6B4 Build Equipment Replacement (PIGA/G6B4 BER)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Missile Guidance Set (MGS) repair is dependent on the proper functioning of the PIGA build equipment. The PIGA build and test equipment used at the repair facility is well over twenty years old and is becoming unsustainable due to obsolescence issues. This program will modify or replace the Digital Pickoff Alignment station, Electrical Alignment stations, Alignment Test stations, a Torque Test station, a Temperature Probe Calibration station, Fluid Fill stations and a Slip Ring/Module Test station.

The G6B4 BER impacts three stations: the G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station, the G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station, and the Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS). The G6B4 Rotor Balance Test Station (S-133-18024) is used to determine radial and dynamic balance of the G6B4 gyro rotor after repair, and it needs to have the obsolete Schenk balancer and console replaced. The G6B4 Hydrogen Fill Station (S-133-132-4-384) is used to fill the G6B4 with hydrogen gas following repairs, and it needs to have obsolete and failing gauges, plumbing and valves replaced. The Gyro F-coefficient Station (GFS) (S-133-18038) is used to calibrate the F-coefficient of the G6B4 gyro after repairs are complete; it needs its obsolete hydraulic and electrical power systems replaced.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>LGM-30G Performance Assessment Data System Communications Equipment Interface Unit (PADS CEIU)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The current Communications Equipment Interface Unit (CEIU) is used to transmit MM III Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Performance Data (IPD) from MM III LCC to the Performance Assessment Data System (PADS) at the support base via telephone lines. The CEIU is unclassified equipment but interfaces with both classified and unclassified systems. The update will utilize more secure and reliable internet protocol transmission methods. The update effort consists of rewriting the CEIU imbedded software language using secure coding practices and changes the CEIU design from telephony to internet protocol. In addition, the PADS interfacing system is to be updated to interface with the updated CEIU design. EMD effort completed/Milestone C achieved March 2019.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>LGM-30G ICBM Cryptography Upgrade II (ICU II) program utilizes the ICBM Prime Integration Contract (IPIC) services of Northrop Grumman (NG), which were competitively awarded for the design and development of the ICU II capability. The contract type of the ICU II Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract is Cost Plus Incentive Fee. Also, ICU II EMD uses a separate contract for Nuclear Safety Cross Check Analysis/Performance Analysis and Technical Evaluation (NSCCA/PATE) Independent Validation &amp; Verification (IV&amp;V). This contract is driven by critical nuclear safety requirements to perform an independent assessment of all modifications to nuclear-certified software. The Support Equipment effort includes EMD development of Depot Support Equipment, Guided Missile Launch Electronic Circuit (GMLEC) interface modification, and Acoustic Microscope System.  Nuclear Safety and Vulnerability analysis requirements are covered in the Acquisition Strategy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Worldwide Joint Strategic Communication efforts include Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems to include the Defense Injection Reception Emergency Action Message (EAM) C2 Terminals (DIRECT), Aircrew Alerting Communications Electromagnetic Pulse (AACE), the Strategic Emergency Action Transmission System (SEATS), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), and the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS).  Funding may be used to modernize these, and other, NC3 systems.  Funding may also be used for research, testing, validation, certification, configuration management, and assessment of the Air Force NC3 Weapon System.   

SACCS is a dedicated, high speed, multi-level secure, data transmission, processing, and display system. SACCS provides the primary non-survivable command and control capability for receiving and disseminating secure Emergency Action Messages (EAM), Force Direction Messages (FDM), Force Status Reporting (FSR), and exchanging information type messages from USSTRATCOM. SACCS provides messages for effective deployment of strategic bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, mobilization aircraft, tanker support aircraft, and the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force.   

SACCS has equipment that has reached its end of life and is no longer repairable due to diminished manufacturing sources and parts obsolescence. This jeopardizes Air Force Global Strike Command's (AFGSC) ability to meet mission requirements as required by Chairman Joint Chief of Staff Nuclear Technical Performance Criteria and Operational Standards (CJCSI 6811.01). In order to mitigate the risk of SACCS inability to operate once the current spares are completely diminished, and ensure the system remains secure against modern/future threats, the Air Force is developing a replacement system.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver NC3 Development capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>INTEGRATED STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANALYSIS NETWORK (ISPAN): The mission of USSTRATCOM is to conduct global operations in coordination with other Combatant Commands, Services, and appropriate U.S. Government agencies to deter and detect strategic attacks against the U.S. and its allies.  It provides full-spectrum global strike, and coordinated space, missile defense, and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives.  USSTRATCOM will also provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter.  ISPAN enables USSTRATCOM to carry out these missions.  It is one of DoD's most complex classified computer systems and the only national force level planning system.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver ISPAN Increment 5 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

In FY18, PE 11313F (ISPAN Inc. 4) efforts were transferred to PE 11324F (ISPAN Inc. 5) as an evolution to ISPAN Inc. 4 baseline system.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Mk21A Reentry Vehicle (RV) program will design, develop, produce and deploy an integrated RV capable of delivering the W87-1 Warhead when released from the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The Mk21A will provide needed performance and security enhancements over the Mk21 reentry vehicle to meet the upgraded requirements for the Department of Energy W87-1 warhead. The Mk21A will also meet the requirements laid out in the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Capability Development Document (CDD) as directed by Air Force Global Strike Command.

The major activities in the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase of the Mk21A RV program include: (1) Trade Studies, (2) Prototype designs, (3) Government systems engineering, analytics, and test capability development, (4) RV Risk Reduction, and (5) Weapon System (WS) Integration Risk Reduction. Reentry vehicle components include: high velocity nose tip, high impulse transducer, fuze, aeroshell forward section, body section and rear cover, radio frequency subsystem with antennas, RV spin-up system, inflight disconnect cable and other electrical cables. The Mk21A program will include prime contractor development of applicable support equipment, data, flight test hardware, infrastructure, and training materials while examining and mitigating weapon system integration risks, and nuclear surety, hardness and certification and system vulnerability assessments.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mk21A RV weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F or 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Mk21A RV program acquisition strategy is to deliver an integrated RV capable of delivering the W87-1 Warhead to target beginning in FY30. For the TMRR phase, the Program Office competitively awarded one cost plus fixed fee contract in October 2019.  The Air Force is responsible for developing, producing, and maintaining the RV.  The NNSA develops/modifies the nuclear weapon inside the RV, including the Weapon Electrical System, which is the firing set that interfaces with the DoD fuze.  

The objectives of TMRR for Mk21A are as follows: (1) deliver one preliminary design and two prototypes; (2) incorporate a modular, open systems architecture; (3) implement Model Based System Engineering enabling the government to own the Technical Baseline; (4) demonstrate performance of weapon system capabilities through prototyping, modeling, simulation, and testing; (5) conduct test flight of two prototype RVs in ICBM-like environment. 

The TMRR phase will include a System Requirements Review, System Functional Review, Preliminary Design Review, and prototype RV flight tests. The contractor may elect to perform additional risk reduction testing on select components to further evolve the design during TMRR, to lower component integration risk during the EMD phase. The reference design for the Mk21A includes use of Mk21 Mod 6 aeroshells.  Because Mk21 aeroshells were originally developed as test vehicles for the legacy Peacekeeper ICBM, they must be modified for use as war reserve.  All RV subsystems must also be procured, including the high impulse transducer, radio frequency subsystem, antennas, spin generators, and cables.  

The TMRR contract is a three year based contract plus a one year option potentially extending TMRR and test related activities through 4QFY23. After Milestone B approval, the EMD contract will be awarded as early as 1QFY24.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                                <r2:Remarks>• Aerospace costs in FY20 were included in Mk21A PMA costs, but has been broken out separately beginning in FY21 due to program growth.  This was initially thought to be part of PMA but based on the nature of the work it has been determined as support costs.  
• Civilian manpower increase supports ramp up of Program Office.  Thirteen additional personnel were added in FY20 (all 13 positions were allocated to the program office).  The cost decrease from FY20 to FY21 can be attributed to last year's estimate; the program estimated 25 additional personnel but requirements dictated that only 13 were necessary.</r2:Remarks>

                                <r2:Remarks>• TMRR flight tests require incremental funding up to two years prior to flight tests.  Funds allow contracts to be established for support and the build-up of flight test vehicles in order to meet the scheduled tests.
• FY21 Test &amp; Evaluation support includes developing ground test plans and flight test plans to support development of prototype test vehicles.  These tests will provide detailed, reliable data to inform EMD and to inform the Mk21A development and risk reduction and NNSA of the W87-1 development. The ANDI effort is expected to span over FY20, FY21, and FY22 and will provide critical information for EMD.
• Mk21 Test &amp; Evaluation: Air Force and NNSA Demonstrator Initiative (ANDI) is a former ICBM Demonstration/Validation study that was transitioned to the Mk21A program office beginning in FY21.</r2:Remarks>

The replacement aircraft will provide vertical airlift and support the requirements of four Air Force major commands and operating agencies:  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and Air Force Material Command (AFMC).  AFGSC is the Air Force lead command and operational capability requirements sponsor.  This program is an element of the Air Force's nuclear enterprise reform initiatives.  

Program includes, but is not limited to, continued funding for four test aircraft and two System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) aircraft, support equipment, Interim Contractor Support (ICS), training system air vehicles and devices, Type I training and courseware, non-developmental item (NDI) integration, cyber test articles, associated Government support activities, and permits the initiation of activities to support rapid requirement development.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MH-139 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Regional/Sector Operation Center Modernization program supports the NORAD/NORTHCOM homeland defense and air sovereignty mission for fixed Air Defense Sectors.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED (BCS-F): BCS-F is a bi-national development program with Canada. The BCS-F Program is an AF Homeland Defense battle management command and control system with the capability to integrate data from existing and future civil and military defense surveillance systems into a comprehensive air picture. BCS-F provides tactical communications and data link capabilities with other military and civil systems responsible for planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces for air surveillance, air defense, and control of sovereign US air space. This integrated air picture enhances the capability to conduct peacetime air sovereignty operations and transition to active air defense operations in the event of aggression. 

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED MODIFICATION ONE (BCS-F Modification 1): BCS-F Modification 1 effort will support the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data feeds and Earth Center Earth Fixed (ECEF). The BCS-F Modification 1 effort will be executed as a Cooperative Development Program between the US and Canada.

BATTLE CONTROL SYSTEM-FIXED MODERNIZATION: BCS-F Modernization will support sensor integration, Agile development, Combat ID, and system virtualization for the BCS-F system. 

NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION-INTEGRATED AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM (NCR-IADS): NCR-IADS is a post-September 11, 2001 rapidly fielded capability that improves low altitude detection capability in order to prosecute airborne threats to the NCR. NCR-IADS provides ground-based air defense of the National Capitol Region airspace, and provides an integrated air picture, ground air defense weapons, enhanced regional situational awareness and forensic data collection capabilities for the warfighter mission to protect the NCR. Efforts may include but are not limited to, studies, system engineering, development, integration, and test &amp; evaluation required to prevent system obsolescence and evolving cyber security requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BCS-F capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and GCS configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.

The MQ-9 Reaper system has four separate development programs. This PE includes:
1. MQ-9 System Lifecycle Agile Modernization (SLAM). This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy to include concept exploration for an MQ-9 follow-on.
2. MQ-9 Development and Fielding. This effort is for development and fielding of the baseline MQ-9 aircraft and GCSs and associated communications systems, sensors, payloads, simulators, support equipment, and resolving Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.
3. Squadron Operations Centers (SOC). This effort is for development and fielding of standardized operations centers. SOCs contain the equipment necessary for remote split operations, to provide mission data and tasking information to aircrew, and to disseminate and/or exchange mission data with decision-makers and the intelligence community.
4. MQ-9 Upgrade. This effort is to develop improvements for existing systems and to field new capabilities for the baseline MQ-9 fleet using an Agile Acquisition Strategy.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MQ-9 System Lifecycle Agile Modernization (SLAM) Program develops and integrates improvements for existing systems and fields new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through an Agile Acquisition Strategy to meet evolving mission needs. SLAM includes concept exploration for MQ-9 follow-on effort.

The objective is to enable rapid fielding of new software, hardware, and sustainability for integration into the MQ-9 fleet with requirements from the Candidate Capability List (CCL) that may include, but are not limited to, efforts to reduce system configurations; perform technology upgrades; increase pilot awareness and usability; improve reconnaissance targeting and exploitation; expand weapons system selection and lethality; enlarge suitability to varying operational theaters; improve security and self-protection; reduce logistics footprint; train the warfighter, and prototype.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, studies, analysis, simulations, demonstrations, prototyping and testing, use of subject matter experts agencies to develop and test MQ-9 system capabilities and follow-on which include, but are not limited to System Integration Laboratory (SIL)/ Hardware in the Loop Laboratory (HILL) and Detachment 3 (Det 3) improvements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) and Non-Recurring Engineering issues.

Where appropriate, the MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develops and integrates upgrade capabilities to support of the MQ-9 modernization strategy.  Development combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expedited delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process.  New capabilities include, but are not be limited to, upgrades of existing aircraft, Ground Control Station (GCS), communication, payload systems, and software updates. MQ-9 SLAM also addresses and resolves Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

Candidate Capabilities are determined by Major Commands (ACC, AFSOC) direction and inputs that included Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) and Urgent Operational Need (UON) requests.  Approval of software/hardware content was established in FY 2018 based on current operational priorities.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, operator simulators, reliability and maintainability, test support, communications, and urgent services.

During development MQ-9 PoR and AFSOC will cost share on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The basic MQ-9 Reaper system consists of the aircraft, sensors, Ground Control Station (GCS), communications equipment, weapon kits, support equipment, simulator and training devices, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), technical data/training, and personnel required to operate, maintain, and sustain the system. The system is designed to be modular and open-ended. Mission-specific equipment is employed in a plug-and-play mission kit concept allowing specific aircraft and GCS configurations to be tailored to fit mission needs.

The MQ-9 Reaper aircraft is a single-engine, turbo-prop Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) designed to operate over-the-horizon at medium-to-high altitude for long endurance sorties. The aircraft is designed to primarily prosecute critical emerging Time-Sensitive-Targets (TSTs) using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR), and laser designator-based attack asset with on-board hard-kill weapon capability (hunter-killer). It also performs Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target Acquisition (ISR TA).

The MQ-9 system is continuing to develop and field capabilities to meet evolving mission needs through incremental upgrades, including but not limited to, increasing the maximum gross takeoff and landing weight; increasing operational range and endurance; propulsion system improvements; integrated redundant avionics; incorporating provisions for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) exportable version of the weapon system; communications upgrades to include but not limited to datalink encryption, Internet Protocol (IP) networking, secure voice and data communications; navigation system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; sensor/stores management computer improvement; MIL STD-1760 advanced weapons data bus; advanced sensor and weapon payloads; improved human-machine interface (HMI); software updates needed to support new configurations and development; integrating additional precision weapons; and hardware and software upgrades to the GCS.  The program will also complete airworthiness and weapon system certification and accreditation; produce applicable training for payloads funded in other program elements (e.g. SIGINT, communications, Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI), Near Vertical Direction Finding (NVDF), Gorgon Stare Quick Reaction Capability, advanced Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED), missile defense, hyperspectral, and other sensors and weapons). Development efforts will address reliability, maintainability, sustainability, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS), and safety issues. Activities also include, but are not limited to, trade studies, analyses, preliminary systems engineering, system and subsystem level testing in accordance with DoD and military standards, and specification development in support of both current program planning and execution, and studies supporting analysis and investment in future MQ-9 program planning.

The GCS functions as the aircraft cockpit and can control the aircraft either within Line-of-Sight (LOS) or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) via a combination of satellite relay and terrestrial communication architectures. The GCS is either mobile to support forward operating locations or fixed at a facility to support reach back Remote Split Operations (RSO). The GCS has the capability to perform mission planning; provide a means for manual control; and enable personnel to launch, recover, and monitor aircraft, payloads, and system communications status. It incorporates secure data links to send aircraft and payload commands and receive system telemetry and payload data; monitors threats to the aircraft; displays the common operational picture; and provides support functions. Launch and Recovery GCS (LRGCS) is used for servicing, systems checks, maintenance, launch and recovery of aircraft under LOS control for hand-off to a mobile or fixed facility GCS, and conducting operations within LOS range of the LRGCS. GCS upgrades will be developed and fielded in coordination with improvements to other MQ-9 system capabilities and in response to evolving operational and information assurance/certification and accreditation requirements. 

This project will also increase interoperability among developed systems by developing common standards and tools. 

MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share during development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.

Funding may be used to address DMS and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) issues.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The MQ-9 Reaper system will be acquired via sole-source contracts with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. (GA-ASI), L3Comm, and Raytheon as the prime contractors. GA-ASI is the prime contractor for aircraft and ground control stations. GA-Mission Systems (GA-MS) is the prime contractor for Lynx SAR. L3Comm is the prime contractor for the Predator Satellite Link. Raytheon is the prime contractor for the MTS-B EO/IR sensor system. Management of development and fielding of new capabilities will be through an acquisition strategy that combines the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as a Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process. This will allow continued baseline improvements while rapidly integrating limited urgent needs fleet-wide.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The SOC is required to employ Remote Split Operations (RSO). It provides the communications, network, aircraft control and sensor distribution circuits to effectively execute RSO missions. The SOC provides CONUS-based aircrews mission data, tasking, and ability to disseminate and exchange mission data with decision-makers and intelligence entities. This effort defines component standards, develops and stands up a SOC Systems Integration Lab (SIL), and integrates new technologies to maintain currency with technological and platform advancements. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The MQ-9 Upgrade Program develops and integrates improvements for existing systems and fields new capabilities for the MQ-9 fleet through an Agile Acquisition Strategy to meet evolving mission needs.

The objective is to enable rapid fielding of new software, hardware, and sustainability for integration into the MQ-9 fleet.  Per the Candidate Capability List (CCL) signed on 01 November 2019, capabilities may include, but are not limited to, efforts to reduce system configurations; mitigate Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) through planned tech upgrades; enable airspace integration; increase weather tolerance; train like we fight; enable airborne situational awareness; enable ops in a contested environment; build open architecture, reduce logistics footprint; improve cybersecurity resilience, improve reliability and maintainability, increase lethality, improve human machine interface to enhance user experience; and improve readiness to prepare for tomorrow's war.

Activities also include studies, analysis, simulations, demonstration, prototyping, and testing, use of subject matter experts and agencies in developing and testing MQ-9 system capabilities, to include System Integration Laboratory (SIL)/ Hardware in the Loop Laboratory (HILL) and Detachment 3(Det 3) improvements. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MQ-9 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F..

Funding may be used to address Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) and Non-Recurring Engineering issues.

MQ-9 Program of Record (PoR) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will cost share development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Development will combine the rigor of an event driven development process (referred to as Technology Maturation Effort (TME)) with the expeditious delivery of a schedule driven integration and fielding process.  New capabilities include, but are not limited to, upgrades of existing aircraft, Ground Control Station (GCS), communication, payload systems, Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS-B) and software updates needed to support new configurations and development, the addition of new capabilities and subsystems, as well as addressing and resolving DMS issues.

Candidate capabilities are determined by Major Command (Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)) direction and inputs that included Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) and Urgent Operational Need (UON) requests. Approval of software/hardware content was established in FY 2018 based on current operator priorities.

Activities also include, but are not limited to, operator simulators, reliability and maintainability, test support, communications, and urgent services. 

MQ-9 PoR and AFSOC will cost share development, where appropriate, on joint efforts that are required by both programs to support the new capabilities.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A-10 concept of operations requires a flexible, adaptable and survivable weapon system to conduct close air support (CAS), combat search and rescue (CSAR) and special operations missions. The A-10 must conduct around-the-clock air operations under various weather conditions against numerous and varied enemy threats.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. 

Operational Flight Program (OFP) development addresses evolving and continuing user requirements that must be incorporated in the aircraft software in order to employ advanced weapons (SMART Triple Ejector Rack (TER), increase situational awareness and enhance targeting capabilities as they become available. The funds budgeted continue regular OFP suite development efforts.

The RDT&amp;E funds provide A-10 Developmental and Operational Testing ensuring all added capability meets safety and airworthiness criteria. FMT's DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient. Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver A-10 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The A-10 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) 1 program is expected to field with the Suite 11 Operational Flight Program (OFP). In addition to software integration, there is support equipment for maintenance that will need to be purchased. The bomb lift adaptor will be required for loading the weapon on to the aircraft stations. The Combat Munitions BIT Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE) tester will be required for maintenance back shops. These testers are required for the BRU-61 software checks. Lastly, BRU-61 trainers will be required for qualification training on the maintenance side.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Deployed A-10 units are reporting increased breakage/failure on weapons pylon retention snap hooks (J-Hooks) resulting in damage to the 1760 wiring harness at a rate of 4 to 6 times per week.

Breaking J Hooks/damaged 1760 cables were initially identified in 2009 during the PE program. A-10 SPO East contracted Lockheed Martin Owego to develop a solution. The design was successfully put through DT at Eglin AFB. OT was subsequently conducted for 30 days, dropping >100 munitions with no defects noted. A-10 SPO has no documentation from OT. J-Hook T-2 Modification was shut down and the design shelved. This J-Hook modification design is now government property.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is the world's premier fixed-wing, high performance, single engine multi-mission fighter aircraft that comprises 48% of the AF fighter inventory.  Operational since 1980, the F-16 has proven itself in combat in a variety of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions, such as, offensive and defensive counter-air, close air support, forward air control, air interdiction (day/night and all-weather) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)/destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD).  The F-16 remains the USAF's primary SEAD/DEAD platform.  The aircraft has evolved its capabilities by capitalizing upon advancements made in computers, avionics systems, engines, and structures technologies to meet emerging warfighter requirements and combat current and evolving enemy threats. These computer processing and avionics upgrades are critical to building a modernized architecture that promotes current open, agile, and digital concepts to enable future technological growth of the F-16's capabilities well into the 2040s and beyond. Furthermore, the F-16 provides the capacity called for in the NDS by supplying the USAF the highest readiness rates at the lowest operating costs of any US fighter.  The F-16 programs listed below also support the NDS's call to strengthen alliances by being the DoD's largest Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program servicing over 26 countries and growing.  The funding described in this document directly maps to the NDS as it provides upgrades to the F-16 platform enabling the delivery of joint lethality in contested environments in the coming decades.  The specific modification programs listed below directly contribute to accomplishing the mission objectives as described in the NDS.

Modification programs include: Operational Flight Program (OFP) development required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, hardware (HW) and software (SW) mods to meet Home Land Defense (HLD) Mission, DoD mandates, and maintain updates on the respective F-16 training simulators, and other hardware subsystems; EMD Hardware/Advanced capability improvements require funding to develop, test, and qualify, weapon systems, aircraft subsystems replaced or modified due to requirements changes, pre-planned product improvements (P3I), Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) and parts obsolescence; Modular Mission Computer (MMC) Upgrade/Display Generator Upgrade resolves shortfalls in mission computer memory and throughput brought on by the addition of incremental combat capability addresses cyber-security and includes Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE), design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding; F-16 Training Simulator updates enable the USAF to exercise/train using the most current F-16 OFP available to all block configurations, to include both aircrew and maintenance trainers; Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) on F-16 aircraft, and includes NRE, test assets, SEEK EAGLE, integration, and flight test; Comm Suite Radio Upgrade (CSU) improved satellite communication (SATCOM) radio upgrade with Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) capability to meet next-gen tactical narrow band SATCOM with better crypto capabilities; an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar capable on all blocks that offers enhanced lethality, advanced electronic protection capabilities, as well as, improved reliability and maintainability on F-16 aircraft; Multi-functional Information Distribution System-Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS) provides a real-time, jam resistant and secure information system for the transfer of combat data, voice and navigation information between widely dispersed battle elements; Hybrid Flight Control Computer (HFLCC) Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) development and integration prevents most controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents using terrain database and prediction algorithms for aircraft trajectory recovery and executes an automated fly-up maneuver to avoid collision; Advanced Identification Friend or FOE (AIFF-Mode5) on F-16 aircraft provides improved airspeed and location info to ground stations and other equipped aircraft in vicinity; Digital Radar Warning Receiver (DRWR) improves existing radar warning receiver performance and Electronic Warfare (EW) threat detection range, azimuth, detection time, and allows reduction of radio frequency compatibility (RFC) issues with other on board transmitters.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-16 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F 

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2019 Air Force penalty total is $50.0M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>OFP tapes are updated continually to integrate new weapons, targeting pods, and improved avionics.  

Both M-Series and Software Capability Upgrade (SCU) programs enable the design and coding of software for integration efforts. OFPs are required to integrate new precision weapons, advanced targeting pods, improved avionics, and hardware and software modifications to meet DoD mandates and build a modern avionics architecture in order to keep the F-16 current. OFP enhancements enable the F-16's ability to operate in contested environments and defend the homeland, which directly maps to NDS requirements. The OFPs are developed organically by the 309th Software Engineering Group (SWEG) at Hill AFB, UT. Systems Integration Labs (SIL) are required to integrate software into the host hardware and validate user requirements and check out system safety and security prior to release to flight test.

The OFP effort also contains Program Management Administration (PMA) support activities to include travel, office supplies, training courses, Video Teleconferencing (VTC) and support contractors.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>The MMC upgrade on the F-16 post-block aircraft, (Blk 40, 42, 50, 52) resolves shortfalls in mission computer memory and throughput. Funding includes NRE, design, development, integration, and ground/flight test for fielding of improved MMC capabilities with the M8.0.3 OFP and fielding of PDG upgrade with the M8.1 OFP. The addition of an Ethernet High Speed Data Network (HSDN) facilitates future increments of combat capability with the OFP and system compatibility/interoperability (e.g., digital targeting pod video).  
The Programmable Display Generator (PDG) upgrade allows a fully integrated multifunction display solution including Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) integration with Sensor of Interest (SOI), format swapping and high definition video on 4x4 displays; provides improved display formats during dynamic maneuvers; resolves symbol freezing issues due to throughput constraints; and provides a sustainable approach to address growing DMS concerns with the current Programmable Display Generator.
Both the MMC and PDG directly map to the NDS as critical enabling technologies required for the F-16 to operate in contested environments and defend the homeland.  Additionally, MMC upgrade, PDG upgrade, and High Speed Data Network make up critical elements to building a modern F-16 avionics architecture while promoting current technology concepts of open, agile, and digital.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS) provides real time, jam-resistant and secure information system for the transfer of combat data, voice and navigation information between widely dispersed battle elements.  MIDS-JTRS enhances situational awareness by exchanging digital data over a common communication link that is continuously and automatically updated in real time. Additionally MIDS-JTRS's enhanced capabilities provide concurrent multi-netting which enables Link 16 by adding capability to receive four messages in a single time slot and allows for greater network design flexibility along with concurrent contention receive capabilities and J-voice. The F-16 MIDS-JTRS effort is developing Ethernet connectivity within the terminal. This program maps to the NDS by providing crypto modernization for tactical networks and more secure command and control, which enable increased interoperable
communications across the joint force. This critical communications capability generates a more lethal force to defeat enemies and achieve sustainable outcomes that protect the American people and vital US interests.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-16 Program acquisition strategy is to improve capability, maintenance and safety mods through OFP development/flight test, enhanced weapons integration, structural upgrades, and simulator concurrency.

F-16 OFP SW updates will continually bring new capabilities to the warfighter. OFP SW development effort is now completely developed at Hill AFB (309 SWEG). Numerous Integration contracts (CPFF, FFP) are required to allow for Improved Avionics, Weapon, AIFF Mode 5, MIDS-JTRS integration to successfully field with each OFP.

MMC Upgrade awarded to Raytheon on 22 Nov 2016. PDG Upgrade awarded to General Dynamics Mission Systems on 17 Apr 2017. The EMD HW/Advanced capability improvements will develop, test, and qualify aircraft weapons systems, including subsystems and uses various contract types (Cost Plus and Fixed Price).

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON) contract for development and production of the APG-83 radar awarded to Northrop Grumman on 31 May 2017. The US Government is the prime integrator and a separate contract is established for Lockheed Martin to provide integration support.

AIFF Mode 5 program uses numerous contracts for DMS resolution, integration, production, support and installs. Funding will be awarded on the following contracts: Harness IDIQ, Bracket IDIQ, Falcon 2020, Mode 5 IDIQ, and SASSM/EGI IDIQ.

Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) development will accomplish test and evaluation of the AGCAS system on F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft. Contracts with LM, flight test, and engineering contractor were awarded in 2018.

DRWR is organically being integrated on the F-16 by F-16 System Program Office (AFLCMC/WWM) and the Electronic Warfare and Avionics (EW&amp;A) System Program Office (AFLCMC/ WNY) at Robins AFB, GA. The ALR-69A production contract (managed by AFLCMC/WNY) was awarded on 30 March 2018 to Raytheon, Goleta, CA (CAGE CD 06129).


The ALR-69A software is organically managed by AFLCMC/WNY utilizing the 579 SWES (Software Maintenance) team and the OEM Raytheon, Goleta, CA. The ALR-69A hardware is sustained by the 408 SCMS (Supply Chain) and 402 AMXG (Hardware Maintenance) at Robins AFB, GA.

Flight Test requires both organic test range support and various contract support for integration test of F-16 subsystems to ensure capabilities meet CAF fielding schedule, which includes Radio Frequency Compatibility (RFC).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-15 is the most versatile fighter in the world today. The F-15C/D continues to provide air superiority with an undefeated and unmatched aerial combat record. The F-15E retains this air superiority capability and adds systems, such as advanced imaging and targeting systems, to meet the requirement for all-weather, deep-penetration, and night/under-the-weather, air-to-surface attack. Configured with conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), the F-15E deploys worldwide with minimal tanker support and arrives combat-ready. A mainstay in operations both domestic and abroad, a refresh of older F-15C/D aircraft with the F-15EX and upgrades to newer F-15C/D aircraft and F-15E aircraft (avionics, armament, airframe, and engines) are critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Projected to remain in service past 2040, avionics modernization is key to long-term weapon system viability. This modernization is built on a foundation of technical and acquisition support studies (both internal to the Air Force and through outside contractors), forestalling obsolescence, exploiting proven technological advances, and leveraging new technology. Major avionics upgrades center around radar modernization (both hardware and software upgrades) and the exploitation of enhanced capability via precision timing, data delivery and processing technology, precision registration systems, cockpit Heads Up Display (HUD) and Heads Down Display, instrumentation digitization and modernization, central computer processing power increases, digital mission event recording systems and an infrared (IR)-based fire control system. The proliferation of fourth-generation enemy aircraft and sophisticated "double-digit" anti-aircraft missile systems pose a significant threat to F-15 survivability. A fully integrated electronic warfare suite holds the promise of providing survivability as well as expanded electronic attack capability. Nearly all improvements are linked to an aircraft operational flight program update schedule that works to integrate new capabilities with the airframe. These updates are a responsive way to increase the offensive and defensive capability and survivability of the F-15. Incorporation of corresponding spiral and/or phased technology/equipment improvements that include support equipment, mission planning systems, and training device upgrades will improve performance, supportability, and aircrew training. Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion, and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This includes technical and acquisition-related studies to ensure F-15 lethality and survivability beyond 2040.

The total F-15EX RTD&amp;E funding for FY20 in the amount of $431.8M resides in Program 0207134F Project 670131 ($67.4M) and Project 676020 ($364.4M). FY21 RDT&amp;E funding resides in Program 0207146F.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in Program 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A refresh of the F-15C/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. 

Funds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

As directed in the FY 2018 NDAA, Sec 825, amendment to PL 114-92 FY 2016 NDAA, Sec 828 Penalty for Cost Overruns, the FY 2019 Air Force penalty total is $50.0M. The calculated percentage reduction to each research, development, test and evaluation, and procurement account will be allocated proportionally from all programs, projects, or activities under such account.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-15EX design will be based on the F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities like the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. Since most subsystems are projected to be mature when required for integration into the F-15EX, the acquisition strategy is deemed low risk. To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to focus engineering activities on integrating existing systems and ramping up the production line capacity. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Due to congressional language, two (2) F-15EX aircraft were moved from Procurement to RDT&amp;E.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These development efforts include F-15 Radar Enhancements Electronic Protection (EP) capabilities, Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades, Flight Testing, Infrared Search and Track (IRST), Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Technical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS)and Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO(SATURN).  Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness.

The Radar Enhancements (EP) will upgrade the digital Active Electronic Scanned Array (AESA) radar capabilities to counter sophisticated electronic threats.  Prior OFP's introduced EP into the C/D-model fleet. Initial EP capability for APG-82(V)1 equipped E model aircraft took place in Suite 8E. Suite 9 and beyond will add additional EP capability to both the F-15E and F-15C. 

For the F-15 to maintain operational effectiveness, the program must continuously provide the platforms with improved capabilities.  To accomplish this there is an on-going need to develop software and hardware upgrades and to flight test new capabilities and systems.   The OFP funding line is transiting the Air Force to an annual software release to counter the speed of technology and maintain a competitive advantage.  Additionally, the OFP provides the path for integration for other activities into operations.  At any one time, there will normally be three OFP upgrades in work: one in requirements definition/pricing, one in code writing and test, and one in flight test and release preparation.  The Flight Test funding line allows the Air Force to fund the on-going test effort. 

Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system will provide air to air detection, tracking and ranging capability for F-15C/D in a radar-contested environment.

Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)/Second Generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO(SATURN) will provide Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capable Air Force F-15C/D/E aircraft the ability to communicate on the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation in support of a NORTHCOM Airspace Control Alert (ACA) requirement. SATURN will replace the Have Quick II and comply with the NSA lease key mandated dates.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) provides Air Traffic Control position and other secondary surveillance data and must be installed on all CONUS aircraft by 2020 IAW FAA mandate. 

Data Transfer Module II (DTM II) is an upgraded replacement for the obsolete and outdated data transfer device currently in the F-15. DTM is 30 years old and out of storage capacity. DTM II will provide improved mission planning capability, updated interfaces, replace an aging map system, and meet growing security requirements.  

Advanced Crew Station contains high resolution digital color large area displays; these will replace the current antiquated monochrome displays. These upgraded displays enable accurate distinction and identification of targets, decrease risk of frat/missed targeting, and enable full utilization of radar capability that significantly enhances situational awareness. 

ALQ-128a will replace the legacy ALC-128 design and includes development and integration of a re-designed ALQ-128a Electronic Warfare Warning Set (EWWS).

A refresh of the F-15C/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C/Ds are beyond their service life and have SERIOUS structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. Funding supports procurement of two (2) F-15EX aircraft and associated support equipment, training system upgrades and materials, depot stand-up planning, initial spares, and other related items to manufacture the aircraft, provide operational conversion (from F-15C/D to F-15EX) support, and meet logistics and sustainment requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Title>F-15 Infrared Search and Track (IRST)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system provides F-15C/D/E/EX's with the capability to detect and track objects by infrared radiation. This capability complements the radar to enhance survivability and lethality against air-to-air threats, air-to-ground targeting, provides a passive infrared sensor system that searches for and detects infrared radiation, and provides the aircraft mission computer track file data on infrared targets. The IRST system further adds capability for the F-15 as a 4th generation fighter by supporting 5th/6th generation fighters to increase their lethality and survivability.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver IRST weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-15EX design will be based on the F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities like the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. Since most subsystems are projected to be mature when required for integration into the F-15EX, the acquisition strategy is deemed low risk. To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to focus engineering activities on integrating existing systems and ramping up the production line capacity. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.

Program is a continuation of effort which includes the development of all F-15 models.  Funds are executed organically in support of equipment improvement, study, analysis, and test.  Acquisition and management strategies for each program are independently developed and use a variety of contract methods and types to accomplish program objectives.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Manned Destructive Suppression (MDS) program funds the development and sustainment of the Air Force's Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) capabilities. The F-16 HARM Targeting System (HTS) is currently the only programmed reactive SEAD/DEAD capability and enables targeting the HARM missile in its most lethal 'range known' mode. The program provides F-16 Block 50/52 and Block 40/42 aircraft with the ability to employ the AN/ASQ-213 Pod. With the introduction of Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) HTS Revision 7 in 2007, the AN/ASQ-213 Pod now has a precision geo-location capability to target Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) to destroy fixed and mobile enemy air defense elements.  Additionally, by relocating the AN/ASQ-213 HTS R7 Pod to the aircraft's left inlet hard point, the F-16 can simultaneously carry the HTS R7 Pod and an Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). HTS R7 fielding is complete and represents the Air Force's near-term solution for reactive time-critical targeting for DEAD until this mission can be transferred to the F-35. HTS R7 derived precision targeting data can be provided to all Joint Forces via Link-16. This effort continues upgrades for the HTS and applies technologies similar to those demonstrated in the Advanced Tactical Targeting Technologies (AT3) program and HTS R7 development.

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver MDS weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HTS R7 Software Update Program (SWUP) is underway to keep the HTS pod capable in a growing threat environment. The SWUP 3 Risk Reduction (RR) contract was awarded in December 2015 as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract type. The SWUP 3 RR development effort completed in March 2019.  

The SWUP 3 Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) and SWUP 4 RR contract awarded in April 2019 as a CPFF contract type and is a 36 month effort. The SWUP 3 EMD portion includes plans for two releases to the field, Builds A and B. The SWUP 4 RR portion will mature candidates for future software builds by addressing findings from the field, incorporating requested improvements from the warfighter, and implementing other software changes to keep the HTS pod updated and mission capable.

The SWUP 4 EMD contract is planned for award in March 2020. This contract plans for two releases to the field, Build A and Build B.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-22 Raptor provides air superiority to the Joint Force, access in the highly contested operational environment, as well as homeland and cruise missile defense for the next 40+ years. The F-22 is a multi-mission fighter aircraft that combines low observability, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics to make it the world's most capable air superiority aircraft. The program is continuing planned, incremental modernization development that enhances both F-22 Air Superiority and Global Strike capabilities. The F-22 modernization program upgrades the air vehicle, engine, and training systems to improve F-22 weapons, communications, navigations, pilot systems, and electronic warfare.

The F-22 Raptor's modernization development is conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor enterprise to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.

Funds may be used to resolve emerging safety of flight and diminishing manufacturing sources issues, accommodate technology insertion and fulfill Federal Aviation Administration or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-22 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Project Communication Systems, combined the following major thrusts Link 16, Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe and Systems Engineering/Program Management Support from BPAC 674788.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Budget Program Activity Code focuses on delivering Link 16 and Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities to the F-22 Raptor.

Link 16 will deliver Link 16 Transmit and enhance existing receive capabilities. Link 16 capabilities will be enabled by Open System Architecture (OSA) and enables 5th generation F-22 fighter aircraft to transmit tactical information through datalink to the 5th generation F-35 (a.k.a. 5th-to-5th), as well as to 4th generation aircraft (a.k.a. 5th-to-4th). Transmitting tactical data to other aircraft types via datalink is a top Air Force priority. With Link 16 Transmit, the F-22's superior 5th Generation sensor suite will critically support the situational awareness of all participants in the operational environment. Mode 5 IFF will deliver IFF Transpond and Interrogate capabilities. Mode 5 IFF is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-mandated Blue Force identification capability that improves Raptor survivability and reduces fratricide risk DoD-wide.  Mode 5 IFF brings significantly enhanced combat identification in both quality and security. All capabilities will be fielded on the F-22 Block 30/35 combat coded F-22 fleet.

The F-22's Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF developments are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor enterprise to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a scheduled cadence for capabilities as they mature.

FY20 planned execution in sensor systems in BPAC 674785 will be $69M to include the $50M Congressional Add for F-22 Modernization.  FY20 planned execution in communication systems in BPAC 674788 will be $186M.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This major thrust was formerly comprised of Link 16, Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Systems Engineering/Program Management Support. As part of the F-22 Capability Pipeline, implemented through Section 804 Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) authority, Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF consists of software and hardware development necessary to field both the Link 16 Transmit capability, and tactical Mode 5 IFF Transpond and Interrogate on the F-22. Link 16 Transmit will be accomplished via an Open System Architecture (OSA) integrated with F-22 legacy avionics. The OSA implementation will provide a pathway to more competitive and open  F-22 modernization. Mode 5 IFF also provides an opportunity to incorporate other updates to Link 16 capabilities into the Raptor. This major thrust also captures F-22 program activities related to integrating the advanced Talon SPITBALL Link 16 antenna onto the F-22. Includes mission support requirements for the F-22 Program Office to include, but not be limited to: travel, computer costs, cost estimating data, strategic analysis and support, systems engineering process management and other miscellaneous contract support. The F-22 Link 16 and Mode 5 IFF product lines are conducted using a rapid acquisition construct leveraging commercial best practices such as agile and lean. This allows the F-22 Raptor enterprise to develop, test, and field software/hardware from multiple programs (product lines) using a cadence approach as capabilities mature.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program will develop and field an affordable, highly common family of next generation strike aircraft for the United States Air Force, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps and International Partners countries. There are three variants: the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant; the F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant; and the F-35C Aircraft Carrier suitable variant. Maximum commonality among the variants, consistent with National Disclosure Policy, will minimize total air system life cycle costs. 

Beginning in FY 2020, Continuous Capability Development &amp; Delivery (C2D2) efforts designated as Block 4 that are not USAF-unique (US Service and International Partner common requirements) are requested in PE 0604840F. Remaining funding in PE 0207142F supports USAF-unique on-going User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES), SEEK EAGLE, Hybrid Product Support Integrator (HPSI) and Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) requirements. These continuing efforts are not new starts.

JSF C2D2 efforts provide incremental warfighting capability improvements to maintain joint air dominance against evolving threats. Requirements designated as Block 4 include a robust weapons integration portfolio and provide new opportunities for International Partners to assess, integrate, and field unique capabilities based on global sovereign requirements. The F-35 JSF Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A to have the capabilities and provisions for DCA operations in the first post-SDD block upgrade. DCA is a NATO and US priority which is a critical capability in our collective defense and credible deterrence, with certification needed by Jan 2024. DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operations for the F-35A is internal carriage of up to two B-61s. Due to extensive certification requirements, the DCA capability planning and design, testing and certification will continue throughout Block 4. Funding in this PE will resource the following F-35A DCA activities: development, analysis, test, integration, certification and risk-reduction activities necessary to field and maintain F-35A DCA capabilities throughout post-SDD block upgrades; assessment of DCA weapon integration and certification impacts on the JSF aircraft; identification and mitigation of potential technical and cost risks; definition of integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon; follow-on risk reduction efforts to ensure future integration alignment with the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade; full integration efforts pending Service decisions. This is not a new start effort.

The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) is the AF organization chartered to perform the compatibility mission and manage the compatibility enterprise. AFSEO delivers warfighting capability through aircraft/store compatibility testing and evaluation and provides accurate combat weapon delivery and mission planning software. Beginning in FY2020, the USAF will support FTI wiring and weapons integration tasks related to SEEK EAGLE requests. These tasks include, but are not limited to, envelope expansion, mixed loads testing, and adding additional stores. This is not a new start effort.

The F-35 HPSI's primary role is to integrate support across the supply chain, maintenance, sustainment engineering, logistics information technology and training disciplines. It will deliver enduring, global support for fielded F-35s while preparing for future force expansion. USAF only will fund additional PMA to transition to a final HPSI, which will support sustainment analysis with product support managers, focused on long-term strategic planning and transition to a final integrated support plan. This is not a new start effort.

USAF F-35 User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES) provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - UIDES that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning. This is not a new start effort. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-35 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

International Partner Contributions</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) is the AF organization chartered to perform the compatibility mission and manage the compatibility enterprise.  AFSEO delivers warfighting capability through aircraft/store compatibility testing and evaluation and provides accurate combat weapon delivery and mission planning software.  Beginning in FY2020, the USAF will support Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) wiring and weapons integration tasks related to SEEK EAGLE requests.  These tasks include, but are not limited to, envelope expansion, mixed loads testing, and adding additional stores.

USAF F-35 User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES) provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - UIDES that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements. 

Neither the SEEK EAGLE nor UIDES effort is a new start.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Block 4 Planning and Systems Engineering from preliminarily design and requirements decomposition through completion of Developmental Flight Test for all variants of the F-35 aircraft.  Modernization efforts include Requirements Decomposition and continuous development and release of capabilities identified as Block 4 upgrades. This is a continuation of the previous Block 4 developmental contracts, which will include activities leading to successful completion of Developmental Flight Test, to include select facility upgrades required for Block 4 research, development, test and evaluation. Included in Block 4 are upgraded capabilities and continuous improvements to maintain Air System viability against evolving threats indicated in the Electronic Warfare Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICD, and the Block 4 Capability Development Document (CDD), reduce life cycle cost, and improve operational suitability. Continuous risk reduction activities to include Air System Integration, preplanning for subsequent Block 4 Modernization events, and investments to deliver the full Block 4 Air System capabilities as needed. C2D2 capability planning includes an efficient transition from F-35 SDD to C2D2. As SDD development activities ramp down C2D2 will assume responsibility for improvements and modernization efforts.

Beginning in FY 2020, the USAF unique ALIS User Information Data Exchange Service (UIDES) requirement will be broken out separately from the remaining systems engineering. USAF F-35 UIDES provides for Air Force development of a F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) - User IT Data Exchange Service (UIDES) that supports current and future Information Exchange Requirement (IER) data transfer capability from the F-35 ALIS into data reports and configurable tables to receive, store and integrate F-35 operations, maintenance, training and financial data within existing Air Force enterprise views and systems to support the growing fleet of AF F-35 aircraft, the ability to feed F-35 training and operations data to ALIS, and support modification of an enhanced data sharing capability (ability to consume increased volume and variety of ALIS IER data) to support operations planning, pilot and maintainer training, and depot data configuration and integration requirements. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program/project planning and execution and future program/project planning.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Description>Integrated Test activities in support of Block 4, to include Lockheed Martin and Pratt &amp; Whitney support at all test sites. Non-recurring engineering required to plan for the service life extension of existing DT aircraft and modification necessary to bring DT aircraft fleet to a more production representative and sustainable configuration, and to develop flight test instrumentation and release test software to meet Block 4 requirements. Additional upgrades required to support development and evaluation of improvements driven by changes in the threat environment and as identified in the Electronic Warfare ICD, the Fifth Generation Fighter Modernization ICS, and the Block 4 Capability Development Document (CDD). Efforts include non-recurring engineering and procurement of a test article to evaluate service life of F-35B STOVL Aircraft.

Beginning in FY 2020, the USAF will support Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) wiring and weapons integration tasks related to SEEK EAGLE requests. These tasks include, but are not limited to, envelope expansion, mixed loads testing and additional stores.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Autonomic Logistics Inforamtion System (ALIS) Development</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) continues to deliver the core logistics and maintenance infrastructure requirements for the F-35 enterprise. ALIS includes features such as aircraft scheduling, training delivery, record keeping, technical data delivery, supply chain management, maintenance management, pilot and maintenance debriefing, and mission planning. The ALIS development program is focused on two primary lines of effort: supporting the F-35 enterprise Data Transformation effort and continuously integrating and delivering new capability.

ALIS is focused on continuously integrating and delivering new software for current and the F-35 enterprise's next generation logistics and maintenance configuration. The required new capabilities have been defined by the US Services and include cybersecurity updates, decentralized maintenance, Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM), Training Management System upgrades, Personnel Flight Equipment (PFE), Low Observable Health Assessment System (LOHAS), Corrosion Management System, squadron resource sharing, and new propulsion capabilities.  All aspects of ALIS software are included in current ALIS development. The software development will have applicability to the Standard Operating Units (SOU), Central Points of Entry (CPE), and the Autonomic Logistics Operating Unit (ALOU) for both classified and unclassified hardware. Under the umbrella of current ALIS, an Agile DevOps pilot is working to rapidly deliver capability updates to the fleet and change the way that current ALIS delivers software.

ALIS re-architecture effort that began in FY 2019 will deliver its first next-generation configuration in Sep 2020, and complete fielding in FY 2023. ALIS will redesign its software, data, and hardware architecture with a focus on cybersecurity, affordability, resiliency, and supportability.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>This is a joint program with no executive service. Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) authority alternates between the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force and currently resides with the Navy. 

Program Element 0604800N/0604800M continues USN development efforts budgeted in 0603800N prior to FY2002. The United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway are participants in the SDD phase of JSF.

PE 0604810M/N ends in FY18 and continues in PE 0604840M/N as budget moves from BA05 to BA07.

PE 0207142F common Block 4 requirements moved in FY20 to PE 0604840F to separate USAF unique requirements.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The C2D2 acquisition strategy is to employ both Cost and Fixed Price Incentive contracts for the Block 4 engineering and development efforts. A new modernization contract structure will be established for all post SDD Block 4 efforts. In addition, a separate Basic Ordering Agreement or Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract is planned to provide a long term approach to upgrading and maintaining laboratories and test aircraft and supporting technology maturation for future C2D2 capabilities.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:Remarks>The Project information shown here reflects USN, USMC, USAF and International Partner funding total for each contract.  By agreement, USN and USMC funding shares are approximately equal and when combined are equal to the USAF share. Partner funding share is based upon future aircraft procurement numbers updated annually in accordance with the Production, Sustainment, Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) (formerly Follow-on Modernization (FoM)) Memorandum of Agreement. 

Subtotals and totals may not add due to rounding.

FY 2019 reflects $414.998M USAF/$215.366M USN/$222.644M USMC/$209.763M International/Total $1,062.771M
FY 2020 reflects $11.850M USAF only; remaining efforts continue in PEs 0604840F/M/N

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Hybrid Product Support Integrator's (HPSI's) primary role is to integrate support across the supply chain, maintenance, sustainment engineering, logistics information technology and training disciplines. It will deliver enduring, global support for fielded F-35s while preparing for future force expansion.  USAF only will fund additional PMA to transition to a final HPSI, which will support sustainment analysis with product support managers, focused on long-term strategic planning and transition to a final integrated support plan.

Funding for HPSI was previously programmed for in PE 27142F/BPAC 675346.  This is not a new start.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls for the F-35A variant to have the capabilities and provisions for Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) operations in the first post SDD block upgrade.  DCA refers to the capability to carry and deliver conventional and non-conventional weapons. DCA operation for the F-35A is internal carriage of either one or two B-61-12 weapons.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>This effort provides for the assessment of Dual Capable Aircraft (DCA) weapon integration and certification impacts on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. It identifies and mitigates potential technical and cost risks, as well as defines the integration and certification trade-space to field the DCA capability with the B61-12 weapon. This effort also supports follow-on risk reduction efforts that will ensure future integration alignment with the earliest feasible post-SDD block upgrade, and is expected to include full integration efforts pending Service decisions.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>The total F-15EX RTD&amp;E funding for FY20 in the amount of $431.8M resides in Program 0207134F Project 670131 ($67.4M) and Project 676020 ($364.4M).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>A refresh of the F-15C/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C/Ds are beyond their service life and have serious structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure. 

Funds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/ Material Shortages (DMSMS) and/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>The total F-15EX RTD&amp;E funding for FY20 in the amount of $431.8M resides in Program 0207134F Project 670131 ($67.4M) and Project 676020 ($364.4M).</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>A refresh of the F-15C/D fleet is critical to maintaining combat viability (lethality, survivability, and supportability) in support of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Older F-15C/D aircraft will be replaced to maintain a viable mix of 4th and 5th-generation fighters for the next 20+ years. The F-15EX will be based on the 2-seat F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF only capabilities, including the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. With two seats, it will be multirole-capable and operable by one or two aircrew. Many F-15C/Ds are beyond their service life and have serious structural risks, wire chafing issues, and obsolete parts. Readiness goals are unachievable due to continuous structural inspections, time-consuming repairs, and on-going modernization efforts. The average F-15C/D is 36 years old with over 8,400 flight hours; the oldest F-15C was delivered in 1979. Logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.

Funds may be used to manufacture aircraft, support equipment, and initial spares to support test activities; integrate hardware and software subsystems; upgrade training systems and systems integration labs; develop training materials and technical manuals; pursue other non-recurring engineering activities to reduce integration risks, ramp up the production line capacity, prepare for flight testing, and investigate technology insertion opportunities; resolve Diminishing Manufacturing Sources/Material Shortages (DMSMS) and/or obsolescence issues; fulfill FAA or other mandates necessary to ensure continued aircrew safety and mission effectiveness; and cover other related requirements to manufacture and sustain the test aircraft.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver F-15 weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The F-15EX design will be based on the F-15QA (Qatar) configuration upgraded with USAF-only capabilities like the Eagle Passive Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) and the Suite 9.1 Operational Flight Program (OFP) software. Since most subsystems are projected to be mature when required for integration into the F-15EX, the acquisition strategy is deemed low risk. To rapidly field the F-15EX, the USAF plans to focus engineering activities on integrating existing systems and ramping up the production line capacity. Test activities will likewise be tailored to focus on integration of F-15QA, EPAWSS, and the Suite 9.1 OFP, taking appropriate credit for previous USAF and FMS testing. Finally, logistics, maintenance, and training activities will heavily leverage existing the F-15 infrastructure.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>Funding in FY11 and beyond is for the Block II program only.  The AIM-9X Block I program costs for FY11 and prior are $233.583M.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AIM-9X Block II/II+ Sidewinder (AIM-9X Blk II/II+) continues the evolution of the AIM-9 series of missiles. This missile program delivers a launch and leave, air combat munition that uses passive Infrared (IR) energy to acquire and track enemy air targets and complements the radar guided Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The missile provides first shot, first kill opportunities while conducting basic fighter maneuvering (dogfighting) Within Visual Range (WVR) which is essential for aircrew survival. The AIM-9X provides these opportunities with unmatched offensive and defensive capabilities against threats WVR, even when IR countermeasures are employed.  The AIM-9X also provides air superiority in the Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air battle.  Anti-tamper features have been incorporated to protect improvements inherent in this design.  The AIM-9X Block II missile is critical for projecting power and winning decisively against threats identified in Defense Planning Guidance and the Air Force Strategic Master Plan.

AIM-9X is a Post Milestone C, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT-IC) joint service program led by the Department of the Navy.  The Block II program has completed independent operational testing and found to be operationally effective and operational/suitable.  The program achieved Air Force Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in September 2016 and received Full Rate Production decision in August 2015.  The first Full Rate Production Lot contract was awarded in September 2015.  This budget line will continue technical refresh of critical obsolete components, implement cost reduction initiatives, improve insensitive munitions performance, correct deficiencies, and increase capabilities through software enhancements, and conduct testing to ensure platform integration onto threshold US Air Force aircraft.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AIM-9X weapon system capabilities.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force and Navy continue to develop improvements to the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to counter existing and emerging air vehicle threats operating at high or low altitude, and having advanced Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities.  The development program also enables AMRAAM compatibility with advanced fighters, enhances AMRAAM capability and operational flexibility against current and projected threats, incorporates high payoff technology development, performs risk reduction activities, and investigates new variants and/or alternate missions that may use AMRAAM attributes.  The latest AMRAAM variant, the AIM-120D, delivers improved performance via Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided navigation; two-way datalink capability for enhanced aircrew survivability and improved network compatibility; and incorporates new guidance software that improves kinematic performance and weapon effectiveness.  Operational Testing (OT) was completed in Jul 14 and the Air Force and Navy authorized operational fielding in Jan 15.  The Navy declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in Jan 15 and the Air Force declared IOC in Jul 15.  The program continues to address aircraft integration efforts to maintain compatibility/performance of the missile with changes occurring on threshold AMRAAM platforms per the Capability Production Document (CPD).  To keep the existing inventory as effective as possible and address findings from the field, the Air Force and Navy also develop, test, and field improvements that are implemented via software upgrades reprogrammed into fielded AMRAAMs, and/or hardware upgrades inserted into production units.  AMRAAM is a joint Air Force/Navy, Acquisition Category IC (ACAT IC) program with Air Force as lead service.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AMRAAM weapon system capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Guardian Angel (GA) is an Air Force non-aircraft weapon system within the overarching Special Warfare Modernization program.  GA is a Family of Systems (FoS) based in both human and equipment capabilities formulated to execute Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) across the full spectrum of military operations.  Established by the Air Force Chief of Staff in 2003 and officially captured in AFPD 10-9, the GA FoS is employed by three distinct Air Force specialties: Pararescuemen (PJ), Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), and Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE).  The GA FoS is comprised of nine critical mission areas:  Precision Aerial Insertion, Information Management, Force Application, Visual Augmentation, Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Rescue, Medical, and SERE.  GA focus is on maintaining legacy weapon system capability while modernizing/improving subsystems for better mission effectiveness.

Funds will be used to obtain significant improvements in operational capability and develop items within the GA FoS to include but not limited to:  Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR), Maritime Recovery, Ground Mobility, Technical Recovery, Oxygen Systems, Medical Monitoring, Aerial Insertion, Information Management (including Preservation of the Force and Family (POTFF) Tracking System), and include GA requirements in the Battlefield Air Operations Kit. This may be conducted through industry technology demonstrations, prototypes and associated engineering support to posture the GA program for technology insertion. The Guardian Angel weapon system development activities also include studies, analysis, requirements development and developmental testing to support both current and future program planning and execution.  Funding will deliver enhanced capability for the dismounted Guardian Angel soldier in terms of dramatic weight reduction and increased mission effectiveness across the conflict spectrum.  This funding request will support potential DMS and obsolescence solutions,to include if optimal, life of type buys or bridge buys limited to the program of record quantity.  

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Guardian Angel weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Guardian Angel (GA) program will address warfighter immediate needs to standardize, modernize, and develop additional capability for the weapon system used by Combat Rescue Officers and Pararescuemen. The program will also address future requirements for the weapon system that will encompass the needs of all three GA career fields.  

The GA program is an incremental evolutionary acquisition effort in which requirements are fullfilled through further sub-system development and integration.  These are being identified through updates to the Core Function Support Plan and GA Concept of Employment by HQ Air Combat Command.  The program has been divided into phases to more rapidly meet the user's immediate need to standardize and modernize the weapon system.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>In FY2020, PE 1202247F, Air Force TENCAP efforts were transferred to PE 0207247F, Air Force TENCAP, in order to return program to the Major Force Program for General Purpose Forces.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Air Force TENCAP increases warfighter effectiveness through the exploitation of national capabilities and promotes cross-domain integration of these capabilities into military operations/training and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activities.

AF TENCAP exploits existing air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and Non-Traditional ISR (NTISR) for operational and tactical applications by rapidly prototyping and providing capability demonstrations. Projects are designed to transition to warfighters or national intelligence agencies for operational use, and to appropriate acquisition Programs of Record for sustainment and further development. AF TENCAP projects influence the design and operation of current and future air, space, cyber, national and global ISR, and NTISR systems while providing situational awareness to warfighters, national intelligence agency organizations, and units. AF TENCAP projects will begin an evolution to demonstrate prototype capabilities to accelerate multi-domain awareness data ingestion for Thresher Air/Maritime in a single common operational picture.

The program consists of multiple small projects supporting one of the Air Force Core Function Mission Areas (CFMAs). Projects are executed to provide continued support to Special Operations Forces and the warfighter, with impacts at the national, operational, and tactical levels.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AF TENCAP capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Projects are selected based upon needs identified by the program's customers - DOD Departments, Combatant Commands, Components, MAJCOMs, and/or National Intelligence Agencies. Many projects are executed via existing contracts maintained by other agencies; others are executed via AF TENCAP contracts established with vendors responding to annual Broad Agency Announcements. The U.S. Government organization sponsoring a project is responsible for assuming acquisition, deployment, logistics, sustainment and budgetary responsibilities for the developed capability after it has been successfully demonstrated by AF TENCAP.

AF TENCAP projects typically use an incremental acquisition strategy. AF TENCAP utilizes a disciplined systems engineering approach that allows program teams to solve problems through a series of segments. Each increment has to be successful to pursue the following segment which mitigates cost and schedule risk.

Contracts funded in this program element will be awarded using competitive procedures to the maximum extent possible.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) provide long-range target acquisition and expanded weapon delivery envelopes for greater aircraft survivability. ATPs feature an infrared (IR) sensor, charged coupled device television (CCD-TV), laser designator, eye-safe laser, laser spot tracker, infrared marker, and real-time video data link for connectivity with ground forces. As non-developmental items, the majority of improvements to ATPs are the result of investments made by industry Internal Research and Development (IRAD).  In addition to operational flight program (OFP) development, this funding provides for the development and integration of capabilities which are either above the capabilities of the industrial base or that require accelerated development timelines in order to meet operational requirements.  It also includes program management support, technical analysis, studies and assessments necessary to support the development and integration of future capabilities.  Data-linking is one such area where there is an identified gap between industrial capabilities and operational requirements. Additional development efforts will be structured to support the documented ATP requirements as well as urgent operational needs (UONs) as they become known.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver precision attack weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $1.826 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>COMPASS CALL is the Air Force's wide-area, Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) Command and Control Warfare/Information Operations (C2W/IO) weapon system. The employment of this weapon system interrupts adversary's use of the electronic battlespace and is a key active component in the information battlespace and prosecution of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). COMPASS CALL's sophisticated electronic attack system is capable of surgical denial and/or disruption of adversary Radio Frequency (RF) communications, radar and sensor systems. The system was fielded in 1983 and to date has evolved through a series of incremental upgrades. The Baseline 2 (BL2) configuration and the mid-Baseline 2 (MBL2) enhancements are the latest in a line of mission system upgrades to the EC-130H. The BL2 configuration and MBL2 enhancements currently fielded have advanced COMPASS CALL's electronic attack capabilities significantly over the two previously fielded baselines. Baseline 3 (BL3) activities address new target-specific techniques, selective capability against advanced commercial communications, digital voice recognition and digital mission crew systems. Due to the rapid advances in electronic attack techniques and technology, COMPASS CALL was designed to be adaptable and must continuously modernize and evolve to keep pace with adversary tactics and emerging technologies. Continuous system development is required to maintain battlespace superiority. The two COMPASS CALL Mission Crew Simulators (CCMCS #1 and CCMCS #2) are upgraded per the mission system Baseline schedule to ensure training capacity keeps pace and matches the operational and technological upgrades delivered in the fielded aircraft. The Weapons System Trainer (WST) mirrors the capabilities of the fielded aircraft's cockpit avionics and communications equipment as well to ensure training provides the worldwide operational proficiency needed to comply with evolving Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) enhancements, parameters, and guidance.

The COMPASS CALL program employs an incremental development and fielding strategy that puts capability into the warfighter's hands as soon as practical and ensures each iteration of the weapon system is effective against the highest priority threats. To sustain that process requires a steady stream of system development funds. Development funds are required to accomplish subsystem additions and improvements such as Counter Radar technologies, Counter Communications, new target-specific techniques, new modern communications receiver technologies, further weight reduction, repackaged transmit antennas, the next generation of Special Purpose Emitter Array (SPEAR), Human-to-Machine Interface (HMI), and other classified hardware, firmware and software developments necessary to counter military and commercial communications evolutions, command and control operations enhancements, and new/emerging sensor developments.

FY 2021 RDT&amp;E efforts will concentrate on Baseline 4 (BL4) and future baseline initiatives for Prime Mission Equipment (PME) upgrades and integration. The programmed BL4 upgrades will advance the PME capabilities as the FY 2021 development efforts address the evolving electronic attack requirement for the foreseeable future. Obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)/Vanishing Vendor Items (VVI) are addressed with each baseline upgrade/enhancement as well as annually as part of the sustainment responsibilities. FY 2021 RDT&amp;E efforts include studies and analyses to support current program planning and execution including, but not limited to development efforts for future baseline capability planning to include low-band transmit capability, transition to open architecture and increased Software-Defined Radio (SDR) capability, subsystem upgrades, power expansion, transmit and receive development, Size/Weight/Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) reductions and Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) clip-ins.

Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during COMPASS CALL's prolonged commitment to overseas operations, the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver COMPASS CALL capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>COMPASS CALL maintains operational relevancy through an incremental upgrade strategy in which a new "Baseline” mission system configuration fields approximately every 3-4 years.  Urgent upgrades between Baselines is accomplished via Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC).  These efforts are accomplished by the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group (645 AESG) in accordance with their Acquisition Strategy Plan (ASP), Program Management Directive (PMD), and Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) and cover the full spectrum of system life cycle management ("cradle to grave" support concept).  Due to the rapidly changing threat environment encountered during COMPASS CALL's prolonged commitment to Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), the acquisition program manager has the authority to redirect funding as necessary to meet current stated and emerging Combatant Commander (CCDR) requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) provides the only source of critical sustaining engineering support for in-service Air Force engines to maintain flight safety (highest priority) to correct deficiencies, improve system operational readiness (OR) and reliability &amp; maintainability (R&amp;M), reduce engine Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustain engines throughout their service life.  

Changes in aircraft operational parameters caused by changing missions and tasks accelerate new engine problems; Engine CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and spares costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP Program weapon system capability. The use of such
program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Engine CIP directly addresses engine related causes to aircraft Non-Mission-Capability rates.

Changes in aircraft operational parameters and/or missions and task missions and tasks accelerating the discovery of new engine issues and the need to resolve issues; Engine CIP provides the only means to develop fixes for these problems. Engine CIP funding is driven by field events and types/maturity of engines, not by the total engine quantity. The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the engine's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational. Engine CIP testing identifies and fixes engine-related problems ahead of operational impacts. R&amp;M related Engine CIP efforts significantly reduce out year Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and replacement spares costs.

Service-related engine deficiencies occur throughout the engine lifecycle. Given the uncertainty with regard to the number and timing of engine-related deficiencies, it is essential for the USAF to have adequate engineering capability, test capacity to rapidly respond to problems as they occur and absolutely paramount to reach SecDef directed 80% mission capability rate for F-35, F-22, F-16, and F-15 aircraft. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the CIP Program weapon system capability. The use of such

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The F135 Aircraft Engine Component Improvement Program (CIP) supports F-35 single-engine fighter propulsion system.  It provides the only source of critical developmental engineering support for the F135 propulsion system.  F135 CIP maintains flight safety (highest priority), corrects service revealed deficiencies, improves system Operational Readiness (OR) and Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M), reduces propulsion system Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and sustains the propulsion system throughout its service life. Historically, aircraft systems change missions, tactics, and environment (including new fuels) and meet changing threats throughout their lives.  New technical problems can develop in the propulsion system through actual use and the F135 CIP provides the means to develop fixes for these problems.  F135 CIP funding is driven by field events and type/maturity of the propulsion system, not by the total quantity of engines.  The program starts with government acceptance of the first procurement-funded engine and continues over the propulsion system's life, gradually decreasing to a minimum level (safety/depot repairs) sufficient to keep older engines operational.  F135 CIP, through "Lead the Fleet" operational use and accelerated mission testing, identifies and fixes propulsion-related problems ahead of operational impacts.    F135 CIP ensures continued improvements in R&amp;M, which reduce out year support costs.  Historically, R&amp;M related CIP efforts significantly reduce out year O&amp;M and spares costs.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CIP Program weapon system capability. The use of such
program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This program, BA 7, PE 0207325F, project 675356, Weapon Data Link (WDL), is a new start.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family of missiles includes: JASSM Baseline (JASSM-BL/AGM-158A) and JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER/AGM-158B and JASSM-ER/AGM-158D). JASSM-ER provides a long range (over twice the range of JASSM-BL), conventional air-to-surface, autonomous, precision-guided, low observable, standoff cruise missile compatible with fighter and bomber aircraft. JASSM-ER provides the capability to attack a variety of high value fixed or relocatable targets with precision, through preplanned missions or target-of-opportunity, deeper into enemy territory than JASSM-BL, all while minimizing the threat to launch aircraft. The Air Force developed JASSM-ER based on a contractor-developed, government-approved System Performance Specification (SPS). The requirement is in the JASSM-ER Capability Production Document (CPD), dated 16 April 2010. Aircraft integration of JASSM-ER/AGM-158B is complete on the B-1, F-15E, and B-52. Objective aircraft are B-52, F-16, B-2, and F-15E. JASSM-ER/AGM-158D is an upgrade to the existing JASSM-ER/AGM-158B, incorporating multiple development initiatives into a single, system-level update to respond to rapidly changing threats and parts obsolescence issues. The program continues development and integration efforts to improve lethality, lengthen operational life and adjust/incorporate emerging technologies.  The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) increased the JASSM inventory objective by 48% which resulted in the monitoring/resolution of obsolescence on 13 subsystems. The program is also evaluating Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JASSM weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS), AN/USQ-163 Falconer, the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS), is the weapon system that the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) provides the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) for planning, executing, and assessing theater-wide air and space operations. The C/JFACC provides air, space and cyber support to the Combined/Joint Forces Commander (C/JFC) by coordinating, deconflicting and assessing the progress of various weapon systems to advance the C/JFC's campaign. The AOC WS develops operations strategy and planning documents. The weapon system also disseminates tasking orders; executes day-to-day peacetime and combat air, space and cyber operations; and provides rapid reaction to immediate situations by exercising positive control of friendly forces.

In FY 2021, funding supports continued software engineering capacity required for AOC WS Modifications to enable the retirement of Theater Battle Management Core System - Force Level (TBMCS FL) and AOC 10.1 while enabling an extensible cloud-based Infrastructure and Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) hosting platform. Additionally, the continued software engineering capacity delivers air operations capabilities improving speed and automation of the full air tasking cycle, including unit-level sortie generation capabilities that feed friendly order of battle information to the Master Air Attack Plan process. AOC WS Modifications are required for the AOC to keep pace with evolving COTS/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through software engineering solutions, integration, testing, fielding, training, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades to the AOC WS. This includes utilization of managed cloud IaaS/PaaS hosting platform. Also in FY 2021, AOC WS Modifications activities evolve the AOC utilizing Agile Methodologies, including User Centered Design, and embracing DevOps practices to deliver improved capabilities in support of mission requirements at Geographic and Global (formerly Functional) AOCs, as well as Support and Manpower Augmentation units, keeping the AOC current and interoperable with the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), cyber requirements, and next generation weapon systems/weapons.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AOC weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy builds on agile software engineering solutions and modification of existing capabilities using evolutionary acquisition to standardize and modify the AOC WS. The initial capability was AOC WS Increment 10.0, which fielded the 10.0 configuration to five operational sites, plus a Help Desk and a Formal Training Unit. The second increment, Increment 10.1, upgraded these locations to an integrated baseline and fielded the baseline to additional operational and reserve units worldwide. The AOC 10.2 sought to evolve the AOC to a Net-Centric environment compliant with DoD Services Oriented Architecture standards but proved late to need using legacy approaches, so the contract was terminated in July 2017 and Program of Record was canceled in January 2018. AOC WS Modifications will utilize FY16 NDAA Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisition for Rapid Prototyping and Rapid Fielding, leveraging commercial best practices of Agile DevOps to scale out a modern virtual private cloud to the AOCs and scale up additional software product teams in support of retiring TBMCS FL and other legacy mission critical applications allowing for eventual disposal of the AOC 10.1 infrastructure. Using Sec 804 authority, time lines are reduced by modularizing both the development work and the associated contracting and funding strategies. This enables dynamic resource allocation based on current warfighter needs. The desired end state is continuous delivery of all AOC WS software.

AOC WS Modifications will leverage the AOC WS Long-Term Modification and Sustainment (LTM&amp;S) contract which will provide support to government led integration of the AOC WS enterprise. AOC WS Modifications will also use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to adopt commercial best practices for software development and to scale out a modern Infrastructure as a Service/Platform as a Service (IaaS/PaaS) solution. Activities are also accomplished via Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR). Additionally, significant technical expertise will be sought after via modular contracting approach and provided by Government Agencies, DoD Laboratory, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Academia, and Engineering &amp; Professional Acquisition Support Services contractors as well as commercial industry partners.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER (CRC)

The CRC is a mobile, ground-based theater air control system (TACS) surveillance and battle management command and control (BMC2) element. It is a customizable, modular, transportable, and persistent weapon system employed at the tactical level to support air and surface operations to provide direct command and control to all air assets in an assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR) and to report back to the Joint Force Air Combat Commander (JFACC). The CRC is a family of systems which include: AN/TYQ-23A(V)1 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), AN/TSC-147, AN/TRC-213/214 Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS), and the AN/TPS-75 radar, CRC's organic radar. Air Combat Command (ACC) CRC Capability Road map provides for the modernization of this family of systems and will be programmed into phased updates through 2037.

CRC is part of the AF's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) initiative, to which CRC will provide a tactical C2 capability. A CRC Bridge to ABMS strategy in FY21 will consolidate previous modernization efforts into a larger initiative that continues the upgrading of battle management command and control, sensors, and communications systems. These continuing modernization efforts will allow CRC to update and improve software, ingest and disseminate Ground Moving Target Indicator feeds and tracks, enable efforts for OMS/UCI compliance, and integrate Top Secret hardware and software capability solutions. 

CRC development efforts support CRC Bridge to ABMS include, but are not limited to:  AN/TRC-213/214 RRSVS radio modernization upgrades (Saturn/MUOS/EOIP), continuous software development, Mode 5 Implementation, Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) tracker, Top Secret (TS)/Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS) and Talon Thresher, continue to pursue emerging technology for Open Mission System(OMS)/Open System Architecture (OSA) advancements, TPS-75 modernization, along with possible hardware changes to support ABMS architecture and L/V/C Operations capability. Also, CRC modifications are required for the system to keep pace with evolving COTS/GOTS components, DoD directives, changes in the underlying IT environment, and to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through the development, integrations, testing, fielding, training and related equipment of new capabilities and upgrades to the CRC.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission: E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) is the premier airborne platform providing Battle Management (BM)/Command and Control (C2) for Commander In Chief and combatant commander tasking in joint, allied, and coalition operations, humanitarian relief, and homeland defense. AWACS provides a real-time picture of friendly, neutral, and hostile air activity. Its capabilities include all-altitude/all-weather surveillance of the battle space; early warning of enemy actions; a real-time ability to find, fix, track, and assess airborne or maritime threats; and detection, location, and identification of electronic emitters.

1. E-3 DMS Replacement of Avionics for Global Operations and Navigation (DRAGON):  DRAGON completes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) air traffic control mandated safety of flight capabilities. This program will provide the E-3 fleet with the flight instruments and other avionics for the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), and the surveillance and communication capabilities necessary to maintain continued critical unrestricted access to global airspace. Non-compliance will result in airspace restrictions and denials that will impact AWACS ability to support worldwide responses to situations requiring immediate on-scene BM/C2. DRAGON replaces the existing Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) Global Positioning System (GPS) Integrated Navigation System (GINS) with a modern Flight Management System (FMS) that will accommodate new capabilities including Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). Also included as part of the modification is the addition of data link communications, voice and data link digital radios, and improved visual displays. Additionally, the acquisition of DRAGON flight simulators also contains DMS efforts which include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulator systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber resilient. The simulator effort also implements requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative. Emphasis on employment of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) avionics is expected to lower cost, reduce the tech refresh cycle, and enhance life cycle management. DRAGON will provide development of support and test equipment needed for DRAGON production; DRAGON will also provide initial DMS and Initial Contractor Support (ICS) needed to support the first US developmental test aircraft (i.e., D-1) prior to the contract award of the DRAGON production effort. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase of DRAGON was being executed as a Cooperative Program between the US and NATO.

2. E-3 Electronic Protection (EP): EP will provide improved radar processing in a specific flight environment to meet a classified requirement. EP will replace the radar controller, exciter, receiver, and data processor in the current Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) system. The EP-processed radar picture will appear on the battle manager's display and is intended to provide APY-2 radar quality to the entire U.S. AWACS fleet. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver EP's weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.
  

3. E-3 Training, Support, and Infrastructure (TSI): TSI provides continuing lab operations and maintenance support for AWACS modernization and enhancement across the enterprise. These activities include managing the AWACS Development Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) infrastructure and tracking and monitoring the AWACS support equipment and program Government Furnished Property. The overall DT&amp;E test infrastructure supports development and production projects and maintains facilities to support AWACS aircraft during system and sub-system testing in Seattle, WA, Baltimore, MD, and Oklahoma City, OK. The TSI assets also support multiple Foreign Military Sales (FMS) projects on a maintenance fee basis, not limited to projects for France, Saudi Arabia and Japan efforts. Key programs include contractual management of the AWACS Avionics Integration Laboratory (AIL) integrated with the Block 40/45 Functional Group configured lab and the AWACS Radar Systems Integration Lab/Software Development Facility (SIL/SDF). These labs provide US, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales customers with a configured development and qualification system and subsystem environment supporting all AWACS system and radar programs. TSI efforts allow new support equipment technologies and test strategies to be analyzed to ensure concurrent capability to sustain existing, modified, and upgraded E-3 equipment. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TSI's weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

4. E-3 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR):  C2ISR system improvements investigate and develop future capabilities of the AWACS weapon system. These efforts also include but are not limited to investigation, analysis, and development to ensure that AWACS successfully integrates with joint and coalition forces in a net-centric environment. C2ISR primarily supports pre-systems acquisition in the areas of materiel solution analysis and technology development. This is accomplished by prototyping and demonstrating capabilities required by the warfighter but also includes developing an E-3 Modernization &amp; Sustainment Roadmap that projects user capability needs, as well as materiel solutions for the user needs.  C2ISR will also support an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, and life-cycle cost of alternative materiel solutions beyond the current AWACS that satisfy an established capability need identified in an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD).

5. E-3 Internet Protocol Enabled Communication (IPEC):  IPEC will provide the Block 40/45 E-3 with a medium-bandwidth Internet Protocol (IP) communications capability to connect to the Global Information Grid and will support net-centric operations/warfare. IPEC will provide a reliable IP-enabled communication capability to support a shortened digitized kill-chain of time-sensitive targets. The modification will provide a permanent Inmarsat-based IP-enabled communications package supporting warfighter identified requirements for increased bandwidth Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and multi-domain networks. 

6. E-3 Combat Identification (CID) DMS:  AWACS' current CID capability is based upon 1960's era technology that has become unsustainable, and requires an update to retain a significant part of AWACS overall mission capability.  AWACS will address C2 CID shortfalls with a modern, persistent Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) BM/C2 combat ID.  CID DMS supports the kill chain and decision superiority. 

7. E-3 Communication Network Upgrade (CNU):  CNU will provide a Link 16 capability with high-jam-resistance, high-speed, crypto-secure computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.  The current 20 year old Class 2 terminal has sustainability/DMS issues and does not support mandated Crypto Mod (CM) &amp; Freq. Remap (FR).  CNU resolves DMS issues, provides CM &amp; FR, Link 16 enhancements &amp; growth for Next Gen Tactical Data Link (TDL).  Risk reduction activities are being executed in cooperation with foreign partners.

8. E-3 Mode 5 Acceleration: Updates flight deck to address known Air Traffic Management restrictions; upgrades the current flight deck transponder to include the Mode 5 capability since DRAGON's IOC 2022/FOC 2028 does not meet the Mode 5 mandate. This subset accelerates the Mode 5 transponder FOC independent of DRAGON. 

9. E-3 AWACS Communications Integration Program (ACIP): ACIP will provide Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Second Generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO (SATURN) capability by replacing the existing Have Quick II and DAMA SATCOM radios with new radios capable of communicating via the existing and additional military waveforms as a combined integration program on AWACS. Provides continued compatibility with US and Allied forces using frequency hopping UHF in support of airborne AMTI &amp; BMC2 to COCOMs for Joint, Allied &amp; Coalition ops by maintaining compatibility with CAF / Sister service C2 nodes and theater assets.

10. E-3 GPS Upgrade (M-Code):  The GPS upgrade provides E-3G AWACS with robust capability to operate in evolving GPS jamming environment. It incorporates M-Code capability into E-3G. As well as provides continued capabilities in GPS jamming environment in support of airborne AMTI &amp; BMC2 to COCOMs for Joint, Allied &amp; Coalition ops. We are compliant with OSD/NII mandate (2006), Public Law 111-383 and FY11 National Defense Authorization Act. 

11. E-3 Fifth to Fourth (5th to 4th): 5th generation connectivity on E-3G will be fielded in two phases: 1)  The first phase fields the capability for E-3G AWACS to operate on 5th generation Link 16 networks that include data from F-22 and F-35 aircraft participants.  This phase will also include the security domain required to integrate the 5th generation data into Mission Computing Software.  2)  The second phase fields the full ability to receive/transmit, ingest and process 5th generation sensory data, combining it with onboard sensor data to create the most accurate air-picture, shortening the kill chain.  This is not a New Start; in FY 2020 program 0604281F, TDNE, project 655262 efforts were transferred to program 0207417F, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), project 67411L in order to properly align requirement with the correct Weapon System.
  
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver E-3 AWACS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $55.2 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>E-3 Fifth to Fourth (5th to 4th): 5th generation connectivity on E-3G will be fielded in two phases: 1)  The first phase fields the capability for E-3G AWACS to operate on 5th generation Link 16 networks that include data from F-22 and F-35 aircraft participants.  This phase will also include the security domain required to integrate the 5th generation data into Mission Computing Software.  2)  The second phase fields the full ability to receive/transmit, ingest and process 5th generation sensory data, combining it with onboard sensor data to create the most accurate air-picture, shortening the kill chain.  This is not a New Start; in FY 2020 PE 0604281F, TDNE, BPAC 655262 efforts were transferred to PE 0207417F, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), BPAC 67411L in order to properly align requirement with the correct Weapon System.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The modernization of the AWACS weapon system consists of multiple capability upgrades that are developed and fielded on competitive and sole source contracts. Full and open competition is explored for all new efforts where market research indicates opportunities exist.  

Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for PEO Digital (AFLCMC HB) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all AWACS Programs, with the exception of the E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade. The E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade MDA is the Secretary of the Air Force, with authority delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) [SAF/AQ]. Of note, E-3 Block 40/45 Upgrade has completed development activities, so it has no 3600 funding and thus not otherwise referenced in this document. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AWACS portfolio and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller Support.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal (JTC TRS) Program, under the Tactical Airborne Control System, funds development necessary to provide a Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable, high-fidelity simulator for Battlefield Airmen, to include Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) operations, Special Tactics Combat Control Team (CCT), and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) operations.

JTC TRS is essential to provide initial training, mission qualification training, continuation training, and currency control requirements to JTACs and Special Tactics personnel. JTAC control training requirements exceed the ability of live-fly aircraft to meet, and JTC TRS is the only capability enabling JTACs to achieve and maintain minimum required training for both qualification and proficiency in accordance with the U.S and Partner Nation Memorandum of Agreement for JTAC certification and qualification.

The JTC TRS Program provides research and development to facilitate interoperability with joint and sister Service air-ground simulation using industry standards. JTC TRS will provide the capability to network aircrew full mission trainers and training centers in a live-virtual-constructive network. This development effort will also integrate ASOCs with the Joint Theater Air Ground Simulation System (JTAGSS) trainer for Joint Fires integration. The simulator will supplement live field training and live-fly sorties to provide realistic introductory, proficiency, currency, and upgrade training in a simulated battlefield, disaster, or humanitarian relief environment.

b. JTAGSS is a continuation of the ASOC simulation trainer initially funded in 2009 and complements the JTC TRS trainer by providing a total air-ground constructive simulation environment for integrated networked training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop JTAC/CCT and ASOC/Special Operations Forces (SOF) Command and Control (C2) battle staff skills.  JTAGSS will provide the ASOC, SOF, and TACP (Tactical Air Control Party) with the vertical and horizontal C2 communications and coordination training and mission rehearsal required for mission effectiveness.   There are insufficient exercises and live training events available to meet mandated readiness requirements.  The system will include a secure network connection, a constructive simulation environment generator with sharable databases, computer work stations that have synthetic reflex agent applications for each ASOC/SOF crew position to execute the air tasking order.  

Funds may be used to address emerging and short-notice Diminishing Manufacturing and Material Shortage (DMSMS) issues.  DMS efforts to include removal of end-of-life software/hardware within simulators systems and move to a modular, common open system architecture that is sustainable and cyber-resilient.  Implement requirements and standards defined under the Simulator Common Architecture Requirements and Standards (SCARS) initiative.  This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the JTC TRS weapon system capability.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>a. The JTC TRS acquisition is a single step to full capability as defined in the CPD. A small business set-aside competitive lowest price technically acceptable source selection was conducted and resulted in the award of a single contract to produce and sustain JTC TRS.  The contract includes pre-priced production options for additional JTC TRS production, Emulated Military Equipment (EME) program management, cybersecurity support, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS), Training System Support Center (TSSC), training, relocation, a legacy system compatibility study.  The pre-price production options include credit to the government for use of existing equipment when updating current fielded active duty immersive JTAC training systems (Air National Guard (ANG) Advanced JTAC Training System (AAJTS)) to the JTC TRS baseline. The contract structure allows for maintaining concurrency, implementing system improvements/technical refresh, and other modifications as required.  JTC TRS awarded a competitive contract in January 2016 to procure up to 32 devices.  The JTC TRS received a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision in February 2017 and is currently fielding production units.  . Development will be required for engineering changes related to Legacy System Compatibility, TACP-Close Air Support System (TACP-CASS).

b. The acquisition strategy for the JTAGSS trainer will be to field advance technology demonstration units to continue to perform proof of concept and technology validation of mission simulations for all ASOC crew positions including detailed communications planning, asset deconfliction, integration of joint fires, and other critical mission areas required for integrated TACP/ASOC C2 mission success.  At the completion of the technology validation, a contract will be competitively awarded to complete JTAGSS development, deployment and integration. Current software is Government or Commercial Off-the-Shelf technologies (GOTS/COTS) allowing almost any training technology development company to compete, which lowers technical risk, schedule risk, and cost.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The mission of Combat Air Intelligence Systems (CAIS) is to process, analyze, and disseminate intelligence for air component and unit operations worldwide by providing key intelligence infrastructure and production capabilities for the supported and supporting forces with true backbone type of intelligence support for air operations and air support to joint operations. CAIS is focused on providing the intelligence infrastructure and funding to Air Force Major Commands, Intelligence, Cyber and Space Squadrons, Field Operating Agencies, and subordinate units.

Modernizations utilize Section 804, Middle Tier of Acquisitions as a rapid fielding effort to provide required modernization to remain interoperable, certified, supportable, and compliant through software engineering solutions, integration, testing, fielding, and sustainment of new capabilities and upgrades. This includes the utilization of Agile software engineering methodologies and managed cloud infrastructure and platform services. Modernizations are required for the CAIS enterprise capabilities, inside and outside AOCs to keep pace with evolving Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) components, integrated Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) components, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and changes in the underlying Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as to deliver effective operational capabilities for the user.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Provides support to personnel using Geospatial resources utilized in Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) databasing applications, technology exploration and refresh initiatives, geospatial imagery data management and dissemination architecture, geospatial information and services modernization, and enablers for intel and targeting capabilities. Provides support to the MAJCOMs to ensure requisite and available target intelligence and GEOINT tools for information directly available to warfighters.

The GEOINT information and service software program funds the Air Force Enhanced Geospatial Product Library (EGPL) which is currently fielded to all combatant command air components and subordinate units supporting global air operations. The EGPL provides digital GEOINT data to support mission planning, targeting &amp; intelligence in support of mission objectives.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Geospatial Intelligence weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is not a new start.

In FY 2021, PE 0207438F, Theater Battle Management (TBM) C4I, Project 675218, Applications Development, was transferred from PE 0305015F, C2 Air Operations Suite - C2 Information Services (C2AOS-C2IS), Project 675218, Applications Development, in order to improve transparency of development programs.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project funds software development capacity necessary to deliver Air Force's (AF) Command and Control (C2) capabilities and services. Applications Development is executed under the Air Operations Center (AOC) Block 20 Modification effort. Applications Development provides worldwide operational capabilities for AF C2 in support of DoD, Coalition Partners, and other government agencies. These efforts focus on support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) that provides air, space and cyber support as presented to the AOC and to other AF and Joint Services C2 systems. Applications Development efforts deliver capabilities identified in the Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability Development Document (CDD) (2013).

In FY 2021, C2 Applications Development will focus on providing software capabilities for the combat plans and operations divisions to build, disseminate and execute the Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP). C2 Applications Development also provides an Airspace Management tool used for building airspaces, evaluating requests and instantaneously generating the Airspace Control Order (ACO). These efforts deliver modern software for inclusion to the AOC Weapon System Modifications to replace the Master Air Attack Plan-Toolkit (MAAPTK) and components of Theater Battle Management Core System - Force Level (TBMCS FL). Additionally in FY 2021, this effort will investigate and develop a solution to address joint partner and non-AOC usage of C2 Applications in TBMCS FL use cases.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Applications Development weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control Strike aircraft, Joint fires, airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from ASOCs and Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.

The purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness/management capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage using networked data communication.

The TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments. The TACP-M program works with the Special Warfare (SW) program office to procure dismounted equipment and software. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities.

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC/TOC systems (used in fixed and mobile operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles) and semi-mobile operations, (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software.

CASS software provides required advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by vehicle-mounted systems and stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, strike aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices, interoperability across the Dismounted, vehicle-mounted systems, and ASOC/TOC mission sets.  It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces. The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF); along with emerging waveform technologies.


ASOC provides management and integration with fires systems, utilizes Air Operations Center (AOC) inputs and archives data, provides a visual depiction of battlespace in coordination with DOD, non-governmental and international partners, house and share TACP planning documents, provides server capability for battlespace, integrates ISR management and video feeds, managing Air Tasking real time, modernizing Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) capability. The ASOC will provide C2 capabilities that will be leader-centric, network enabled, and ready to operate in complex and degraded information environments.

Dismounted and ASOC/TOC/Mounted (ATM) software meets the technical needs of implementing TACP C2 capabilities in operational environments. Software supports a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN/ PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/ PRC-148, AN/PRC-152A, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-161, AN/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN/PRC-150C, AN/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future). Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms. Software upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new end user devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements.

Funding supports Dismount, ATM, and ASOC software to address: interfaces with new dismount requirements, ASOC modernization (interoperability and hardware/software interfaces), changes to Army fires support systems, changes to AOC Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, technical support to operators employing the software, and system prototyping for required future ASOC/TOC/Mounted system capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CASS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development, because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) are Air Force units manned by airmen who advise Army Ground Commanders and plan, request and control air power in support of army ground maneuver operations. These capabilities are employed at all echelons of Army organizations by: Air Support Operation Center (ASOC) TACPs, Division TACPs, Brigade TACPs, Battalion TACPs, and dismounted Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) deployed with Army companies or scout teams on the front lines. TACPs coordinate, request, and control Strike aircraft, Joint fires, airlift support and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support for Army combat operations, and they provide ground communications support for federal disaster response and Homeland Defense operations. TACPs deploy with their aligned Army units and operate in a variety of environments including fixed operations from ASOCs and Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), mobile operations in tactical vehicles, and dismounted (on foot) operations with Army infantry patrols.

The purpose of the Tactical Air Control Party - Modernization (TACP-M) program is to provide TACPs voice, data and video communications, targeting and battlefield awareness/management capabilities. Improved targeting and data communications capabilities provide more accurate target coordinates, reduce Close Air Support (CAS) response times, and reduce the probability of fratricide or collateral damage using networked data communication.

The TACP-M program support includes addressing frequent TACP combat deployments that sometimes lead users to change equipment procurement priorities to support urgent operational needs and respond to evolving threat environments. The TACP-M program works with the Special Warfare (SW) program office to procure dismounted equipment and software. This teaming arrangement helps standardize battlefield airmen equipment, improve efficiency by consolidating acquisition efforts, and often reduces unit costs by increasing procurement quantities.

The TACP-M program provides and modernizes capabilities in the following four major areas: (1) ASOC/TOC systems (used in fixed and mobile operations centers), (2) Vehicle Mounted Systems (used in TACP tactical vehicles) and semi-mobile operations, (3) Dismounted Systems (used by JTACs during dismounted infantry operations), and (4) Close Air Support System (CASS) software.

CASS software provides required advanced communication, advanced targeting capability, and significant interoperability improvements for mobile computing devices used by vehicle-mounted systems and stationary systems used in operations centers. TACP CASS software enables digital data communications with joint Command and Control (C2) nodes, other TACPs, strike aircraft, and Army C2 and Fire Support systems. It includes interfaces with TOC, ASOC, and JTAC radios, and targeting devices, interoperability across the Dismounted, vehicle-mounted systems, and ASOC/TOC mission sets.  It also provides battlespace awareness capabilities needed to plan, request, coordinate, and control CAS in support of ground maneuver forces. The CASS software interfaces with all TACP-M components and provides interoperability with joint strike aircraft (F-35, A-10, F-16, F-15, F/A-18, AV-8B, B-52, etc.), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), artillery fire support systems, network-enabled weapons, and C2 nodes. To enable data communications with those systems / nodes, CASS incorporates several communications protocols including Variable Message Format (VMF), Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Marine Tactical System (MTS), and U.S. Message Text Format (USMTF); along with emerging waveform technologies.


ASOC provides management and integration with fires systems, utilizes Air Operations Center (AOC) inputs and archives data, provides a visual depiction of battlespace in coordination with DOD, non-governmental and international partners, house and share TACP planning documents, provides server capability for battlespace, integrates ISR management and video feeds, managing Air Tasking real time, modernizing Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) capability. The ASOC will provide C2 capabilities that will be leader-centric, network enabled, and ready to operate in complex and degraded information environments.

Dismounted and ASOC/TOC/Mounted (ATM) software meets the technical needs of implementing TACP C2 capabilities in operational environments. Software supports a wide variety of radio systems (including but not limited to AN/ PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/ PRC-148, AN/PRC-152A, AN/PRC-154, AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-161, AN/PRC-163, Harris RF-335M-HH, AN/PRC-150C, AN/PRC-160 and other emerging systems that are expected to be employed by TACPs in the future). Future upgrades are necessary to maintain interoperability with strike aircraft, joint fire support systems, and emerging data networking waveforms. Software upgrades provide a modular architecture for digital communications, messaging, data handling, hardware management, and targeting, and battle space awareness capabilities. The key characteristic of the software will be the Open System, Modular architecture that will enable rapid integration with new end user devices (such as laser range finders and radios) and rapid development, testing and fielding of new mission capability modules to meet future requirements.

Funding supports Dismount, ATM, and ASOC software to address: interfaces with new dismount requirements, ASOC modernization (interoperability and hardware/software interfaces), changes to Army fires support systems, changes to AOC Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), updates for fielded versions, new joint Digitally-Aided CAS (DACAS) standards, technical support to operators employing the software, and system prototyping for required future ASOC/TOC/Mounted system capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver CASS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Tactical Data Links (TDL), as a subset of the broader airborne network, are used in a combat environment to exchange information such as messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs provide a jam-resistant; secure digital data transfer network capability with new and standardized waveforms and data formats allowing Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Beyond-Line- of-Sight (BLOS) intra- and inter-flight communications. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, provide positive identification of aircraft in the network, correlate on and off-board sensor data sharing, target, and threat information, and provide the data link to accomplish time critical targeting and other mission update functions. TDLs are used by all service theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. 

TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situation Awareness Data Link (SADL), Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL) Variable Message Format (VMF), Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT). TDL efforts include incorporating changes and additions to the Link-16 message standard (MIL-STD-6016F) and applicable Interface Change Proposals (ICPs), assisting with Air Force and joint interoperability certification testing with the Air Combat Command (ACC) and Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC); future development, integration, and verification of Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrades due to TDL integration; support of data gathering processes; studying and incorporating data link technologies to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the Global Strike and Global Persistent Attack CONOPS.

This effort provides critical capability and enhancements to the airborne network by creating common development, integration and interoperability among ground and C2 platforms and responds to quick reaction capability integration and demonstration including, but not limited to, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), Global Hawk, Predator, Reaper, Rivet Joint, Combat Sent, and Cobra Ball. TDLs keep all Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) platforms and data linked weapons current/interoperable in the airborne network to enable Global Strike, Global Persistent Attack, Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA / DCA) and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. Due to new/evolving Link 16 User identified Interface Changes Proposals (ICPs), studies and analysis will be performed to identify impacts to current and future systems, and to identify the required changes and impacts of implementing these new capabilities. The activities will include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution, as well as future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver TDL weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

PEO C3I&amp;N manages activities for the common development, integration, and interoperability across the entire airborne network. These actions ensure TDLs are procured and maintained as a joint, end-to-end C2 system. This program executes various types of contract types to provide technical expertise necessary to test, evaluate and provide recommended solutions to modernize C2 platform data links. The program delivers annual lab-tested software implementations of AWACS Link 16 ICPs. Additionally, the program participates in annual lab demonstrations that produce reports as required to assist with platform integration of Link 16 modernization efforts.

The E-3 Platform architecture utilizes a JTIDS Class 2H Link 16 radio with defined environmental and physical cabinet constraints. An Investigation Report (IR) was initiated to investigate the integration of an Ethernet-enabled CMN4 MIDS JTRS variant into the E-3 platform. A separate IR was issued to understand the dynamics of the L-16 enhancements and facilitate integration of new Link 16 capabilities onto the E-3 platform to ensure cross-service interoperability.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY 2019, Project 674802 (Increment 2A) efforts were transferred to Project 674801 (Increment 2B) in order to correctly align funding to activity.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is the USAF system used to project air expeditionary forces (includes weapon systems, logistics, and personnel). It enables the USAF to posture mission ready and equipped forces (organized in effects-based operational capability packages) to deliver air, space and cyberspace capabilities to Joint commanders worldwide. Technical requirements planned for Increment 2B include enabling the system to support Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key enabling as well as elimination of Social Security Account Numbers as the primary key for identifying Air Force military and civilian members by replacing it with the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier.

DCAPES funding will be executed against capabilities packaged into agile development projects for multiple releases based on the warfighter's priorities. Additionally,funding will be used to cover downward directed federal mandates.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the DCAPES system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) is the USAF system used to project air expeditionary forces (includes weapon systems, logistics, and personnel). It enables the USAF to posture mission ready and equipped forces (organized in effects-based operational capability packages) to deliver air, space and cyberspace capabilities to Joint commanders worldwide. DCAPES stores planning and execution information for Air Force (AF) functional users in the four (4) main AF disciplines: 1) operations, 2) logistics, 3) manpower, and 4) personnel. These disciplines support joint, combined, and AF military operations worldwide.  Technical requirements planned for Increment 2B include enabling the system to support Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key enabling as well as elimination of Social Security Account Numbers as the primary key for identifying Air Force military and civilian members by replacing it with the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the DCAPES system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

Funds will be used to perform studies and innovative integration efforts for common technology capabilities such as cloud migration, technology development and mobile application.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DCAPES program successfully awarded the DCAPES Increment 2B Development Task Order for a one-year Base Period and four one-year Option Periods using the NETCENTS 2 Application Services Small Business Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The period of performance started on 6 April 2015 and ended on 5 April 2020. 

DCAPES is an Evolutionary Acquisition Program using an incremental development approach (DoDI 5000.02 Model 3) to develop capabilities over several increments. To support the rapid development and delivery of capabilities, DCAPES employs a hybrid agile acquisition strategy in which capabilities are incrementally delivered in time-phased stages based on warfighter priorities and adoption of key architecture and technology requirements as a trade-off for accelerated delivery and risk reduction.

The DCAPES Program Management Office (PMO) uses a mix of agreements (Service Level Agreements and Memorandums) with DCAPES interface partners. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Capabilities Integration Environment (AFLCMC/HNIZ) to provide the infrastructure used to conduct software development and testing. Memorandums of Agreement with Joint Interoperability Test Command, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Command, and the 45th Test Squadron are in place and outline the test support required before fielding the system. 

The DCAPES Increment 2B requirements have been packaged into multiple discreet capabilities which will be developed in multiple releases. Each capability will be developed using several Sprints and with one or more fieldings to satisfy the approved requirements within each package.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCAPES Increment 2A delivered Air Force functional specific capabilities as well as technical changes necessary for the Air Force to migrate from a directly connected architectural relationship with the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) to one utilizing data services across the Wide Area Network (WAN).  This ‘Loose Coupling' solution enabled DCAPES to be interoperable with JOPES and at the same time significantly reduced interoperability costs.

This program element may have included necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver the DCAPES system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) is the collection, analysis and evaluation of pre- and post-detonation radiological and nuclear materials, devices, and debris as well as the immediate effects created by a nuclear detonation.  
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver National Technical Nuclear Forensics weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develop diagnostic detection systems to immediately record signals resulting from a nuclear detonation.  These event signature elements support weapon and event characterization analysis for the purposes of identifying the weapon classification, magnitude of the detonation (yield), and Reaction Time History (RTH) of the device.  The combination of these elements with radiochemical analysis enables analysts to distinguish between wide ranges of nuclear weapon designs and origin, supporting the national attribution assessment process.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Air Force operates a variety of combat aircraft that carry numerous and varied stores (munitions, missiles, fuel tanks, targeting pods, range pods, electronic countermeasures pods, etc.). Stores are carried in many different loading combinations determined by operational and training scenarios, missions, tactics, and weapon development programs. Aircraft-store configurations/carriage and employment requirements change as operational plans and tactics change and as new stores are developed and fielded. Before operational, training, or test use, the Air Force must certify these configurations for safe loading, carriage, and separation (jettison and normal release), as well as verify ballistics accuracy under the user-certified carriage and employment parameters. The Air Force SEEK EAGLE program completes certification recommendations and recommended flight clearances through any combination of engineering analysis, wind tunnel testing, modeling and simulation, and ground/flight test and evaluation. The SEEK EAGLE effort encompasses eight disciplines: Fit and Function, Flutter, Structural Integrity, Stability and Control, Electromagnetic Compatibility/Interference (EMC/EMI), Separations, Ballistics, and Safe Escape.

In support of certification, the program recommends approximately 1000 aircraft/store combinations for flight each year with analysis and testing, requiring from weeks to years depending on the complexity. Integrated solutions for combat aircrew weapon delivery planning problems are developed and provided to combat forces via Combat Weapons Delivery Software (CWDS) and Joint Safe Escape Analysis Solution (JSEAS). SEEK EAGLE works in coordination with the Air Force Safety Center to provide Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) analysis and certification recommendations of ordnance systems containing electro-explosive devices. The program is also responsible for inserting new and emerging technologies into the SEEK EAGLE process as well as providing resources for the sustainment of a viable Air Force aircraft/store certification capability.

SEEK EAGLE funds are currently budgeted to support certification testing and analysis for new and inventory stores including, but not limited to: Small Diameter Bomb I and II (SDB), Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (LJDAM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Air Intercept Missile (AIM-9X), Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AIM-120D), Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD), BRU-57 (Smart Bomb Rack), BRU-61 (SDB Bomb Rack), Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), Sniper Targeting Pod with video data link, LITENING Targeting Pod with video data link, laser guided bombs, B61 (Mod 12), penetrator warhead upgrades, practice bombs, and aircraft instrumentation pod modifications. SEEK EAGLE funds are also used to support certification of other inventory stores on Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) aircraft. In addition, these funds further support capability development and weapons certification efforts required by Air Combat Command to achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC) for the F-35A. Likewise, these funds also support F-22A weapons certification efforts for emerging weapons and B-21 development for critical Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) milestones. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver SEEK EAGLE capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in Program Element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commanders'.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  Project 675135, Warfighter Readiness, includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command &amp; Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). 

The program element also contains Project 674567, M&amp;S Foundations, the Air, Space and Cyberspace Collaborative Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS).  ACE-IOS is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests, and experiments. The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS weapon system capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation Foundations (MSF) focuses on integrating foundational capabilities needed to improve the usefulness of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) capabilities derived from the Warfighter Readiness (WR) thrust.  The efforts supporting the MSF thrust include both concept exploration and development.  MSF provides the capability to rapidly and efficiently create realistic and accurate synthetic operational battlespaces to support the full spectrum of activities associated
with concept development to acquisition and testing through composite training and mission rehearsals.

Air, Space and Cyberspace Constructive Environment - Information Operations Suite (ACE-IOS) project is a federation of constructive models for the authoritative representation of Air Force information operations.  ACE-IOS is developed and operated by the Air Force Cyber Simulation Center (CSC) to support training and mission rehearsal for the Air Force, Joint Task Force commanders, and Combatant Commands battle staffs during Joint and Service exercises, tests and experiments.  

The CSC provides cyber live-virtual-constructive (LVC) environments to support the development and fielding of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities for the AF, DoD, and national agencies.  The CSC is managed by the 90th Cyberspace Operations Squadron, a unit of the 318th Cyberspace Operations Group, 67th Cyberspace Wing, 24th Air Force (AFCYBER).  The Distributed Mission Operations Center for Cyberspace (DMOC-C) is a subset of the CSC focused on training and exercising tactical cyber mission forces (CMF) and cyber service providers (CSP) and operational-level command and control, intelligence, and cyber planners and operators.  DMOC-C provides the ACE-IOS to support Air Force information operations.  DMOC-C, using ACE-IOS, directly supports Air Force, Joint, Coalition composite training and rehearsal, concept development, and acquisition and testing for use by Major and Combatant Commands.  DMOC-C thrust areas develop and modernize models and simulations covering cyberspace, intelligence and command and control activities as part of the constructive backbone of Air Force capabilities within DOD and coalition LVC environments. 

DMOC-C's development and integration efforts on ACE-IOS are imperative to ensure that air, space, and cyberspace training and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available tools, data, and services.  LVC environments today are used as one of the most cost effective and practical means to meet mission needs.  These efforts enable more efficient delivery of effective capabilities to the warfighter while reducing the time and resources required for design, development, test and evaluation, maintainability and sustainment.

Authorization and Accreditation and Networthiness is maintained via the Information Technology (IT) systems Risk Management Framework (RMF) for seven classified systems and five supported cross domain solutions, which includes code and ruleset development, testing, and fielding, and meets AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and AF Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) net worthiness standards and evaluations.

This program also supports the DoD Training Transformation Initiative.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Modeling and Simulation support to our Warfighter's Readiness is a United States Air Force (USAF) corporate imperative to ensure air, space, cyberspace training, and mission rehearsal activities are supported with realistic, interoperable, and readily available, tools, data, services and environments.  Warfighter Readiness supports Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2) and Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) along with the USAF priorities and core functions.  Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning, execution, and future program planning.  

It includes several complimentary programs, initiatives and areas for investment:  Warfighter and Joint Training Integration supports the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) directed Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) integration efforts and is a critical piece to the USAF's implementation of the Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training.  The goal of LVC training and mission rehearsal is to prepare our warfighters for the full range of military operations and maintain the combat readiness levels required by the Combatant Commands.  This can only be accomplished by training and rehearsing in realistic operational environments.  These environments include live training ranges and virtual simulators enhanced with constructive entities.  Specific training and mission rehearsal events can include some or all of these simultaneously; making the ability to integrate LVC capabilities a necessity.  

The Air, Space, and Cyberspace Constructive Environment (ASCCE) is the USAF's authoritative federation of constructive training models and tools realistically representing the tactical and operational capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight.  This presently includes the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) and its follow on program Command &amp; Control Simulation Environment for Training (C2SET), which provides the authoritative representation of AF and joint theater-level air and space power and is used to train Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) personnel and Combatant Commanders' battle staffs.  The primary models in the AFMSTT are the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM) and Air Base Simulation (ABS). 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver AFMSTT and ACE-IOS capability.  The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Synthetic, and Blended (LSB) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force, joint service, and coalition partners.  The DMOC training capabilities reach 31 geographically separated Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) locations across 17 time zones representing such assets as real-world weapon systems, operator-in-the-loop, and constructive or computer-driven simulations.  It is responsible for development and integration of scenarios, models, and databases and the integration of participating sites into Virtual Flag (VF) training events via numerous network connections, DMOC-developed interoperability tools, and controlled interfaces in support of Air Force, joint, and coalition warfighter readiness.  In addition, activities include Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) technology and capability studies/analyses which support both current and future program planning and execution by:
 
1. Distributed Mission Operations Capability/Battlespace Systems Development:  The DMOC upgrades and enhances the capabilities of various systems, tools, and simulators to incorporate ever-changing technology and emerging training requirements into DMO events, such as Virtual Flag (VF) and Coalition VF (CVF), to enhance the quality of warfighter training.  Activities include Environment Generator development, DMO Tool Development, and Simulator Enhancement.  DMOC is in partnership with the US Naval Air Warfare Center-Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) to enhance the capabilities of the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).  The NGTS is the primary environment generator for both Blue and Red Air in DMOC White Force.  DMO Tool development includes: a)  DMOC Replay Tool (DRT) facilitates a more complete mission review and debrief capability of the exercises as more sites and systems are added to events;  b) enhancement &amp; improvement of the The Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC) provides comprehensive Live, Synthetic, and Blended (LSB) simulation capabilities which prepare warfighters to conduct dominant operations in air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains for theater-level, full spectrum combat training for Air Force, joint service, and coalition partners.

2. Assessment &amp; Authorization (A&amp;A)/Software Certification:  The DMOC supports cybersecurity requirements definition, integration/test support, analysis, systems engineering support, A&amp;A of core systems, and support software certification.  The DMOC implements cybersecurity requirements and is working towards the application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Continuous Monitoring.  Efforts include Cross-Domain Information Sharing / Multi-national Information Sharing (CDIS/MNIS) ruleset development, load sharing, and testing; integration and testing of various newly developed / updated systems such as the DMOC Replay Tool, Dr. J, DIS Filter, and the DMOC Battlespace; and support of Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) software certification.

3. Distributed Training Sites &amp; Systems Integration:  DMOC integrates up to 31 geographically separated LVC training locations and 50+ systems into LSB DMO training events such as VF and CVF by resolving interoperability issues between disparate systems and networks so that all exercise participants can interact in the DMO environment.  New sites and systems are incorporated into LSB DMO events each year based on higher headquarters and Combatant Commander's (CCDRs) emerging requirements.

The FY 2020 funding request was reduced by $1.940 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Distributed Mission Operations Center capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DMOC supports AF/Joint/Coalition DMO and the Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) through the development and integration of DMO training and test events, networks, scenarios, and databases. Due to evolving modeling &amp; simulation technology, the DMOC is an on-going, evolutionary effort to keep pace with those changes by continuously developing/upgrading DMO environment generators, systems, and tools and ensuring integration/interoperability of new systems into DMO to provide the best warfighter training possible.

DMOC has the following two primary contracts that manage the acquisition, development, testing, and integration of DMO standards, training, modeling and simulation, cross-domain information sharing testbed, and exercises on AF/Joint/Coalition DMO networks.  Additionally, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) are sent to other external organizations (i.e. NAWCAD and DMOC-S) to fund development of DMO tools that support DMOC efforts.

Infrastructure, Development, and Engineering (IDE) Contract: Develops/upgrades various DMOC tools, systems, and simulators that are needed to conduct DMO training events. Develops, implements, and tests technical solutions for the integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events.  IDE is a firm-fixed-price contract.

Command and Control Technical Support Contract (C2TSC): Supports government by assisting with development of technical requirements for upgrades to various systems and tools that will be developed by the IDE contractor and then performs acceptance testing of the those products. Develops requirements for site/system integration of sites/systems into VF, CVF, and other DMO events. C2TSC is a firm-fixed-price contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) enables tactical edge Joint and Coalition information interoperability via air, space, and surface systems, to include a Backbone Network for high capacity data transfer.  As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies. Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Survivability Urgent Operational Need (UON) Military Global Positioning System (GPS) and other system enhancements, development and integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, ground support capabilities and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems. Survivability UON is required for BACN Fleet to fly in increasingly contested Area of Responsibility (AOR). Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues, the development of simulators/trainers, development of training materials, and technical publications.

Execute risk reduction activities for development of future capabilities on BACN payload/aircraft efforts. 


Beginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the EQ-4B (a variant of the RQ-4 Block 20/30 aircraft) efforts will taper accordingly, to include BACN payload sustainment &amp; other BACN specific efforts.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) enables tactical edge Joint and Coalition information interoperability via air, space, and surface systems, to include a Backbone Network for high capacity data transfer.  As requirements emerge, BACN will integrate new hardware and software capabilities that improve system performance, interoperability, availability and open mission system technologies.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, expansion of external time reference capabilities, Military GPS enhancements, integration of advanced antennas and waveforms, and assimilation of mandates levied on the BACN systems.   Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs. Safety of flight considerations, including performance, aircraft structural integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements will be addressed.  Efforts will include required non-recurring engineering and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.

This effort will include the development and integration of Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform.

Acquire Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) Payload Trainers/Simulators, to include design of all trainers, training materials, operations and maintenance technical manuals.

Beginning in FY21, to support the divestiture of the EQ-4B (a variant of the RQ-4 Block 20/30 aircraft) efforts will taper accordingly, to include BACN payload sustainment &amp; other BACN specific efforts.

This effort will include the development of a Rapidly Deployable PCE.
This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver BACN weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Military GPS is required for BACN fleet to fly in increasingly contested AORs.  Safety of flight considerations, including performance, integrity, availability, and continuity of service requirements for long range reference, local area reference, and landing/terminal reference, are directly affected by how GPS sensors are used. 

This effort will include the development and integration of Military GPS on the E-11A BACN platform.

Rapidly Deployable Program Control Elements (PCEs) are required to provide agile deployment support to establish remote and full ground control locations in a timely manner to shorten the kill-chain.

This effort will include the development and integration of Rapidly Deployable PCE.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Funding supports the CSAF Title 10 wargaming efforts to test concepts, capabilities, programming choices, and plans using simulation and other techniques, otherwise known as wargaming.  Based on the Department and Air Force direction, there is a concerted effort in these periods of fiscal restraint to reinvigorate, institutionalize, and systematize wargaming across the Department.  This effort requires continued funding to maintain the level of effort to most effectively pursue an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources.  The Air Force continues to refine the wargame process and design to better integrate and synergize those efforts in support of the new Air Force Strategy, Planning, and Programming (SP3) process.  Specifically, in addition to maintaining a robust Title 10 Wargame series, Global Engagement, servicing Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) objectives. The HAF Wargaming Enterprise is executing on-call Wargaming in support of the AF/A5, the Agile series, along with quick-turning wargame support to the USAF Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team (ECCT) requirements, the Enterprise series,  Plan Blue, and to service AF/A5S strategy and concept development objectives; all to better address the requirements of the SP3 process and cycles.  Additionally, HAF Wargaming provides and coordinates Air Force representation at other Service and Joint wargames as they execute across the department.  These efforts are providing decision support to senior Air Force leaders involving investment strategies and develop concepts to best employ U.S. forces in future conflicts.

The Wargame Information Environment (WIE) is a continually evolving system that provides an array of services to game players which enables the accomplishment of game objectives.  The backbone of the WIE is GameNet, a deployable, standalone, Local Area Network (LAN) with servers and laptops that host applications to support virtual battlespace collaboration, decision making, three-dimensional visualizations &amp; mapping, and services.  Behind these applications are cutting edge technologies and database architectures from both commercial off-the-shelf and government developed software that assures relevance to the wargame.  The modeling, simulation, and analysis applications allow participants, adjudicators, and control team members to effectively and efficiently collaborate, make decisions, present those decisions, and execute moves within the wargame; documenting each step in the process.  This information capture enables discovery during the wargame and permits postgame analysis.  These findings inform portfolio rebalancing exercises, concept and strategy development, and very senior leader decision making.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

HAF Wargaming will continue to design, develop models,research concepts, and conduct workshops for Global Engagement 22 including the Capstone event in the Spring of 2022 including its post-game analysis and report writing.(USAF Foundation wargame).  HAF Wargaming will continue to conduct quick-turn wargames in support of senior leaders (Agile, ECCT)as directed including support to other service wargames to advocate for Air Force equities.

From FY20 to FY21 significant has been shown.  From FY20 to FY21 substantial decrease due to change from typical obligation of funds on contract and transitioning to execution rates.  This significantly impacts the wargame 2-yr cycle, and circumvents the Oct 2019 SecDef memo to the Office of Net Assessment for the continuation of long term wargaming.  This PE supports a two year cycle using the NDS as the backbone to develop and execute the series and other supported MAJCOM games.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>In order to achieve an innovative strategy, avoid operational and technical surprise and make best use of limited resources, wargaming requires an evolutionary acquisition approach for every wargame. Contract support is required as wargame and IT specialized expertise resides with industry and is not available organically. The requirements constantly evolve and a challenge to be accurately defined at the outset of the contract; however, we will continue to pursue a firm fixed price (FFP) contract awarded under a full and open competition.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>- MPS software is a layered software, designed with open architected standards and modular construction. The core of the MPS software is the Framework software (FW) used by all MPS platforms and the Navy.  Common Components are distinct services that are used by a select number of platforms.  An example would be weapon specific capability that fighters share. The Unique Planning Component (UPC) is the platform specific software and associated software (install etc.) that is delivered to the users in the form of a mission planning environment. Traditionally, the MPS Systems Program Office allocates FW funding to other Platform Operational Flight program (OFP) development programs.   Beginning in FY20, FW is a separate program code within the MPS Modernization BPAC.

- As part of MPS Modernization, the Mission Planning program is updating the current JMPS architecture with an Open Mission Systems architecture to improve system extensibility, expand the suite of services to meet  operational requirements for the warfighter, improve the user interface and overall user experience, improve system performance, and address security vulnerabilities and cybersecurity mandates.    MPS is also transitioning its software development processes to incorporate best practice Agile DevOps methodologies which will speed the development and delivery of capabilities to the user as well as improve our ability to address changing threats and cybersecurity requirements.  This transition is likely to drive changes in organizational and programmatic structures in the future to align with the Agile DevOps processes and practices. As we integrate the agile development methodology, some program office organizational restructuring into Agile Release Trains (ARTs) will be required.  This is expected to commence in the FY21 timeframe.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print, and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

The Mission Planning Systems (MPS) program is a collaborative program with the Navy to leverage technical solutions and business practices for most Department of Defense (DoD) platforms. It provides automated mission planning tools and support for fixed- and rotary wing aircraft and guided munitions. It replaces two closed architecture legacy mission planning systems (UNIX-based MPS (UNIX-MPS) and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)), with a single multi-service, open architecture system, frequently referred to as the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). MPS will compress the mission planning cycle by providing an improved integrated planning environment, reducing the time required to respond to changing situations and urgent needs such as striking time sensitive/critical targets and conducting combat search and rescue. MPS products have the potential to support all DoD fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft and are shared with the selected programs in the Navy. MPS delivers significant benefits to command and control performance by enhancing information superiority for the warfighter and by providing unique capabilities in support of both precision engagement and dominant maneuver.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be used to supplement the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirement and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable.

This project continues the development of a Joint Precision Airdrop System-Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) capability in conjunction with the Army. JPADS provides a planning capability for DoD airdrop requirements. It is the primary airdrop mission planning system for all ballistic airdrop missions as well as precision guided airdrops that are required when the mission profile or surface-to-air threat assessment warrants a high-altitude and/ or standoff precision delivery.  It enables high-altitude, precise airdrop delivery to forward ground forces, while mitigating surface-to-air threats, reducing risk of exposure to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and insurgent attack on ground convoys. JPADS allows the warfighter to consider weather, terrain, aircraft capabilities, threat, and other data to accurately deliver payloads to U.S. and other friendly forces.

Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) is the key JPADS-MP software deliverable. It will increase the accuracy of airdrop mission planning by improving aircraft, payload, and chute specific calculations along with weather analysis visualization tools specifically adapted for airdrop. Future initiatives are designated to achieve automation of airdrop planning and execution to reduce task saturation in the cockpit and support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) objective of moving to a two-man cockpit. These
efforts include the ability to automatically receive and use real-time winds in any location, calculation of a release point and airdrop in a single pass, the ability to conduct real-time objective area analysis to calculate probable damage estimates and execute dynamic re-tasking, the ability to conduct post-drop assessments, and the implementation of new technologies (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Touch Screen environment).

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system. The use of such program funds would be used to supplement the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on multiple inputs including threats, targets, terrain, weather, aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any fixed- or rotary wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan weapon, cargo, passenger, and/or fuel delivery, calculate fuel requirements, and assess the route based on known enemy threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other aircraft; review, print and brief the plan; download pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft avionics; and, conduct dynamic/in-flight re-planning as applicable. This project focuses on modernizing MPS to support Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF), including the development, test and sustainment of Mission Planning Environments (MPEs) to support the B-1, C-5, C-17, C-130, HC-130, EC-130, E-3, E-8, F-15, , F-22A, KC-10, KC-46, KC-135, RC-135, HH-60 other platforms, Framework (FW) and all Common Component (CCs) software tools for mission requirements. Activities also include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.  MPS Modernization efforts are as follows:

1) CAF MPS Modernization: These development efforts modernize CAF Mission Planning Environments (MPEs).  The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP) requirements, such as new weapons, avionics upgrades, communications systems, etc.  The OFPs requiring MPE updates under the CAF modernization effort include, but are not limited to, B-1 (Sustainment Blocks 15, 16, 16a, 17, 17a and 18),
F-15 (Suites 7, 8, 9, 9.1 and 9.2) and F-22 Increments 3.2B, update Release One, Release Two, and Release Three. CAF modernization also includes updates to mission planning capabilities supporting associated weapons including, but not limited to, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-II), Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). Finally, CAF modernization will address required improvements to CAF related JMPS MPE CCs, including Weapon Planning Software (WPS), Electronic Warfare CC (EWCC), GPS Crypto (including GPS M-code), Weather CC, etc. CAF MPE Modernization includes, but is not limited to, the following platform efforts:

a. F-15 Modernization Phase II &amp; III:  This modernization program consists of multiple software development efforts driven by OFP updates for F-15 Suites 7,8,9,9.1, and 9.2. Suite 7-9 MPE capabilities include, but are not limited to, Data Transfer Device (DTD) improvements, updates for new features in weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb I and II (SDB I and II), AIM-9X, AIM-120D, and Network Enable Weapon support elements (e.g. key handling, weapon data link and Link 16). It will also include enhancements to the synthetic aperture radar planning tool (SAR-PT) and the global area reference tool as well as radar modernization updates (e.g. combat identification, radar planning tool enhancements).  Development efforts for F-15 Suite 8 include, but are not limited to, integration of B61 Life Extension Program (LEP), feature updates for several weapons, and the expansion of Link-16 messages sets. F-15 Suite 9 MPE will include a variety of updates and enhancements for weapons and aircraft systems to include, but are not limited to, Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a new Advanced Dual Core Process II (ADCP-II) computer as well as Digital Transfer Device/Modules (DTD/DTM) modernization.

b. F-22 Modernization Phase I: The F-22 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates v13.1, v14.0, v14.1, and v14.2. These enhancements include, but are not limited to, the addition of improved capabilities for the AIM-9X and AIM-120D, the incorporation of additional electronic protection tasks, combat identification improvements, addition of an Inter-flight Data Link Gateway, Mode 5 IFF and Combat ID updates, Link 16 updates, and incorporation of the synthetic aperture radar planning tool. Additionally, other new and emerging OFP-generated requirements will be addressed as identified by the operational user(s). Other Common Component (CC) updates will also be completed as required.

c. B-1 Modernization Phase I: The B-1 Modernization program includes OFP-driven software updates for Releases 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 11.0.  It will incrementally update the platform MPE and provide updates to the aircraft mission capabilities, including adding sensor anywhere on tactical display, updating threat range rings and route re- planning capabilities, improving Air Coordination Order (ACO) file loading and the memory utilization in the onboard avionics updates. Additionally, it will migrate the B-1 MPE to a native 64-bit environment and utilize Mission Planning Data Service Layers (MPDSL) to modernize the software architecture.

d. The platform efforts include work associated with updates to the framework and associated services. Beginning in FY20 the Framework will be broken out as a separate program with a separate funding line.

2) MAF MPS Modernization: These development efforts modernize MAF MPEs for the KC-46 aircraft as well as all Air Mobility Command platforms initially fielded under MPS Increment 5. The modernization effort will provide new and improved mission planning capability for individual Operational Flight Program (OFP), Global C2, and AMC fuel efficiency requirements.

3) The SMACC Modernization Program includes development, testing, and fielding of MP software for the E-3 DRAGON, E-3/E-8, RC-135 and EC-130. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) is providing a new JMPS capability to the HH-60G and MC/HC-130 aircraft. The follow-on versions continue that development.

4) MAF Modernization effort builds upon the fielded E-8 MPE to provide new and improved mission planning capabilities for the MAF fleet (e.g. C-5, C-130, KC-10, etc.) as required to meet OFP, fuel efficiency, and global planning net-centric requirements. It includes, but is not limited to, enhanced capabilities to accommodate avionics upgrades, improved communications systems, interfaces with command and control systems, new parachutes, etc. for various MAF platforms. Development efforts also include, but are not limited to, integrating improvements to MAF related Common Components (CCs). Examples of these CCs include, but are not limited to, MAF tools, such as Assault Zone CC and the Air Refueling Tool (ART) CC. CSAR Release 1.1 program began in FY17 modernizing the efforts begun with the CSAR products developed in MPS Inc 5. The CSAR effort will continue modernization via agile development for evolving CSAR requirements.

5) Mobility Air Forces Automated Flight Planning Service (MAFPS) Phase Two began in FY17. This effort modernizes the MAFPS products developed in Increment 5. This effort completes the development of a centralized/net-centric global mobility flight planning capability, which will provide significant fuel savings through automated flight route, airspeed, and altitude optimization utilizing aircraft performance, air traffic management, weather, and other data.  Additional development includes streamlining the support structure for flight planning to reduce mission planning and execution time while maximizing the time available for enroute aircrew support.  Also a , Web-based Global Flight Planning (Web-GFP) modernizes a second MAFPS client, the Global Flight Planning Common Component (GFPCC) which integrates into the Global Mobility Mission Planning Environment (GM MPE) aimed at Unit-level mission and flight planning operations.  This client enables GM MPE users with access to the same MAFPS capabilities in order to facilitate fuel and cost efficiencies across the MAF.

6) In FY20 the MPS Framework will be established as an independent Program of Record (anticipated as an ACAT III).  MPS Framework will be used as a one year pathfinder effort that represents the basic corefunctions of the JMPS software. It rides on SDC compliant Windows OS. The basic services that all programs use (Falconview, Data Load, Route construction, flight planning etc.) are included in the MPS Framework architecture. The Navy utilizes the same basic core MPS Framework software. The funding for the MPS Framework has historically been accomplished through an allocation  to the platform mission planning budgets. The programs were based upon the platform OFPs and the fielded software packages (mission planning environments). The program office will segregate MPS Framework for future oversight. MPS FW Framework will be an agile development effort based on services developed in a common development environment.  Beginning with the FY21 efforts, MPS Framework will become Core Mission Planning (CMP).  This will be a follow-on Program of Record continuing the efforts of MPS Framework.

Test, Training, and Certification:  Continues all MPS-related integration, test, and certification activities for all CAF and MAF platforms.

Program Support: Continues all program office management operations and support activities to ensure the timely development, testing, and delivery of mission planning systems to the warfighter.

The platform efforts include work associated with updates to the Framework and associated services.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Mission Planning weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be used to supplement the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, and 0605898F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>MPS Modernization consists of multiple capability upgrades across multiple platforms that are developed and fielded using a variety of contracting instruments. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB AFLCMC/HB) competitively awarded multiple (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantities) (ID/IQ) contracts for software development. Currently there are five (5) contractors, one of which is Small Business set aside, who are qualified sources. Each Delivery Order (DO)
is competed among the five contractors. Efforts to accomplish program activities such as software development, systems engineering and integration, training, and support are competitively awarded using a variety of contract types (e.g. Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Fixed Price (FP), and Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)). Program Management Administration (PMA) contracts are awarded competitively and consist of various types of contracts at various locations. Mitre, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor provides technical support on a no fee for service contract.
Other efforts are accomplished via Purchase Orders (PO) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR). For the efforts listed above, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Hanscom AFB (AFLCMC/HB) provides the program management, contracts, legal, and financial management support. The Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Digital (AFPEO/HB) is the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for all MPS Modernization projects. Performance Metrics

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS) Mission Description: Provides the AFCYBER Commander with the tools necessary to effectively and efficiently plan, monitor, and execute missions in the cyber domain. This includes development and dissemination of Cyberspace Tasking Orders to ensure commander's intent is supported through the application of cyber forces using the latest intelligence. C3MS provides a common operational picture to maintain cyberspace threat activities and integrates cyberspace indications and warnings, analysis, and other actionable intelligence products into overall situational awareness, planning, and execution. 

C3MS will continue modernization efforts based on a backlog of validated requirements to automate battle management capabilities and provide comprehensive cyber situational awareness. Developmental Activities include: machine-to-machine interfaces to dynamically interoperate with Air Operations Center (AOC) systems in order to quickly facilitate collaboration and mutual situational awareness; capabilities to present weapon system operators with force location, mission, effect, and linked information including a standardized, dynamic, map-based, situational awareness interface to display, manipulate, and manage units, missions, network elements, and effects; and multi-level security capabilities to support full-spectrum operations. 

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver C3MS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F

In CY OPERATIONAL HQ - CYBER was a new start.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY2021, PE 0305251F, Cyberspace Operations Forces and Force Support, Project 646008, US Cyber Command Technology Development efforts were transferred to PE 0208087F, Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations, Project 674540, Cyber Tech Products - Payloads, to consolidate prototyping and development of cyber payload capabilities.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) provides advanced offensive cyber warfare capabilities to the 16th Air Force in direct support of US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs), unified commands, and national agency cyber warfighting requirements. DCWO efforts directly support the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, USCYBERCOM operational directives, MAJCOM directive and guidance documentation, and other formal requirements documents in the delivery of offensive cyber effects.

Activities within the DCWO deliver operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities through the research, development, testing, evaluation, accelerated prototyping, demonstration, and fielding of advanced offensive cyber technologies and capabilities. The ongoing development of peculiar support equipment, facilities, operations, fielding, maintenance, and logistical support of fielded systems permits the rapid adaptation of current cyber capabilities to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate adversary actions. This portfolio of capabilities permits Combatant Commanders the ability to operate in and through cyberspace to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy targeted computers, information systems, or networks, and actively gather information from computers, information systems, and networks.

DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing three modular and interoperable elements necessary for the successful presentation of offensive cyber capabilities: Platforms, Access/Infrastructure, and Payloads. When unified, these three elements combine to form a cyber mission thread capable of delivering cyber effects to Combatant Commanders,to include cyber operational preparation of the environment, offensive counter-cyber, cyber-attack, electronic warfare operations, mission planning, intelligence, cybersecurity products and services and Command and Control/Situational Awareness (C2SA) tools needed to attack enemy networks, telephony, Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), command and control systems, and create cyber effects through the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS).

Efforts within DCWO may include the expedited development of innovative solutions for existing and emerging technologies required for the continued superiority within the cyber domain.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $3.215 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Mission Platform (CMP) program is an ACAT III program of record that provides a modular, configurable framework for Cyber Operations. The CMP framework is currently being applied to offensive cyber operations and may also be applied to defensive cyber operations in the future as prioritized by CMP stakeholders. CMP uses an Agile acquisition strategy that allows the USAF to dynamically prioritize the delivery of operational capabilities. CMP develops capability enhancements on a regular cadence and delivers them to operations based on operational need and acceptance timelines. The platform major thrust also includes platform integration development activities necessary to integrate CMP into DCWO mission threads.

All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations.  These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

In FY2021, PE 0305251F, Cyberspace Operations Forces and Force Support, Project 646008, US Cyber Command Technology Development efforts were transferred to PE 0208087F, Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations, Project 674540, Cyber Tech Products - Payloads, to consolidate prototyping and development of cyber payload capabilities.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities by combining these three areas to provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber payload capabilities and foundational tools are required to deliver cyber effects through the DCWO platform and access.

The payloads capability develops and fields cyber tools and payloads leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partnered applications and programs.

Some aspects of the effort are classified and will be provided on a need to know basis. For further information please contact AFLCMC/HNCO, 210-925-6614.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DCWO conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities by combining  these three areas to provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber platforms serve as the primary operator interface in the DCWO portfolio and projects encompass hardware and software development.

The platform capability provides user interface and controls by leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partners' applications and programs.

Some aspects of the effort are classified and will be provided on a need to know basis. For further information please contact AFLCMC/HNCO, 210-925-6614.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>The Cyber Mission Platform (CMP) program is an ACAT III program of record that provides a modular, configurable framework for Cyber Operations. The CMP framework is currently being applied to offensive cyber operations and may also be applied to defensive cyber operations in the future as prioritized by CMP stakeholders. CMP uses an Agile acquisition strategy that allows the USAF to dynamically prioritize the delivery of operational capabilities. CMP develops capability enhancements on a regular cadence and delivers them to operations based on operational need and acceptance timelines. The platform project also includes platform integration development activities necessary to integrate CMP into DCWO mission threads.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations (DCWO) conducts Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) leading to operations-ready cyberspace superiority capabilities including the transition of efforts from laboratory, industry, and academia via studies, accelerated prototyping, and technology demonstrations. DCWO consists of a portfolio of programs and projects providing the rapid acquisition of operational cyber capabilities. DCWO effectiveness comes from balancing funding among three capability thrust areas required for cyber warfare operations: Air Force Platforms, Access and Payloads. The DCWO portfolio provides capabilities by combining these three areas to provide cyber effects to Combatant Commanders. Cyber access capabilities enables a variety of DCWO missions and projects encompass hardware and software development.

The Access capability provides connectivity and required infrastructure by leveraging industry and other Government/non-Government mission partners' applications and programs.

Some aspects of the effort are classified and will be provided on a need to know basis. For further information please contact AFLCMC/HNCO, 210-925-6614.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations program office will utilize Concept, Development, Risk Management, Production, or Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to acquisition planning. All plans will contain sufficient information for the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process. Distributed Cyber Warfare Operations will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV)), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules and a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that should be able to meet many requirements related to Offensive Cyberspace Operations. These multiple-award contractual vehicles have already met the statutory requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), which requires a fair opportunity to all contract holders, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505, unless an exception to fair opportunity applies.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>AF Defensive Cyberspace Operations (AF DCO) provides defensive cyber capabilities that protect the AFNET and DoD network enclaves, to include their associated computer systems, software applications and sensitive operational information against unauthorized intrusion, corruption, and/or destruction. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities, computer and network systems security, damage assessment and recovery, cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation, and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics.

Firestarter utilizes cyber and Information Assurance (IA) technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 16th AF, as AF component to US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide IA &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements. 

Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/ Hunter Team (CVA/H)weapon system develops new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions of AF and DoD networks and systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds the development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet the scope and scale of USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams and AF Mission Defense Teams.

Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA) is an assessment of non-secure telecommunications to determine type and amount of sensitive and/or classified information that may have been disclosed to our adversaries and encompasses the following mission subsets: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, Email Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA).  CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.  FY21 funding is essential in developing new capabilities to combat the rapidly evolving cyber threat.

The AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Force CyberWorx and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with Research and Development funding, can be taken to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capability to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT Funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.

Activities include studies and analysis to support both current program planning and execution and future program planning.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.

The FY 2021 funding request was reduced by $1.654 million to account for the availability of prior year execution balances.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Firestarter program provides newly improved capabilities and technical transition opportunities for Cyber Defense and Information Assurance (IA) technologies and tools needed to defend Air Force Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems from cyber attacks, while ensuring recovery in the event of an attack. The emphasis of the program is directed toward defensive cyberspace capabilities; computer and network systems security; damage assessment and recovery; cyber threat recognition, attribution, and mitigation; and active response methodologies in response to evolving threats and changes to cyber environment. These areas of emphasis are realized through research and development, test and acquisition in the areas of proactive defense, defensive counter cyberspace, cyberspace intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance &amp; situational awareness, persistent network operations, as well as decision support, recovery, and digital forensics. Current Air Force systems, such as the AFNET NIPRNet Gateways, SIPRNet Modernization program, and Host Based Security System leverage this technology to meet their information assurance and defensive cyberspace needs/requirements.

Firestarter utilizes cyber and IA technology investments by US Cyber Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA), Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various government research laboratories, to jump-start its development of solutions to existing Air Force cyber and IA requirements. This program supports AF Cyberspace strategic direction in support of Cyber Defense which provides capabilities to 16th AF, as AF component to US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other services to ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) cyber and IA requirements are being met. Activities performed include those designed to identify, analyze, test, rapidly acquire, and integrate emerging IA and cyber technology and defensive cyberspace weapons systems and capabilities into all regions of the GIG - terrestrial, airborne, and space systems. In addition, this effort will support implementation of DoD Enterprise-wide Information Assurance (IA) &amp; Computer Network Defense (CND) Solutions Steering Group (ESSG) solutions.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This requirement supports the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment / Hunter Team (CVA/H) weapon system development of new capabilities to provide Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) and Combatant Commanders additional mobile precision in addition to currently fielded protection capabilities to identify, pursue, and mitigate cyberspace threats.  The CVA/H weapon system performs defensive sorties world-wide via remote or on-site access.  CVA/H executes vulnerability, compliance, defense and non-technical assessments, best practice reviews, penetration testing and Hunter missions on AF and DoD networks &amp; systems.  Hunter operations characterize and then eliminate threats for the purpose of mission assurance.  The Hunter mission focuses on the capability to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess (F2T2EA) the advanced persistent threat (APT).  This effort funds development efforts to enhance command and control situational awareness and to expand the capability of the current weapon system to meet scope and scale of the USCYBERCOM directed Cyber Protection Teams and AF Mission Defense Teams.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Cyberspace Defense Analysis (CDA): The CDA Weapon System conducts Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) and network defense by monitoring, collecting, analyzing, and reporting sensitive information transiting or residing on the AFNet.  Without proper funding the CDA Operators will not be able to determine potential impacts and operational adjustments resulting from information disclosures or identify compromised information from network intrusions.  There will be a decreased assurance of network defense and an increase in the amount of lost PII, OPSEC, and other sensitive information.  The CDA mission subsets include: Telephony Communications, Radio Frequency (RF) Communications, Email Communications, Internet based Capabilities (IbC), and Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA).  CDA is the cyberspace weapon system that is used to conduct assessments during peace time and contingency operations.  CDA shows its true capability in the force protection realm and helps ensure our adversaries are not provided early warning of our plans, capabilities, or limitations.  FY21 funding is essential in developing new capabilities to combat the rapidly evolving cyber threats.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AF Cyberspace Defense (ACD) weapon system and is designed to prevent, detect, and respond to adversarial penetration into AF unclassified and classified networks. ACD supports Air Force and Combatant Commanders by conducting synchronized Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and providing 24/7/365 monitoring and defense of USAF and US Central Command Secure/Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET/NIPRNET) systems against hostile attack. Daily intrusions to the AF network are analyzed in a forensics manner to identify a multitude of counter defensive and defensive tools and techniques that are required to truly strengthen cyber security. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Air Force CyberWorx, and other Federal R&amp;D entities often have cutting edge solutions, that, with Research and Development funding, take them to the technology readiness level (TRL) needed for rapid deployment as new capabilities to counter critical cyber weapon system vulnerabilities. AFCERT funding for this effort will focus on development of capability, capacity, and potential modifications to increase the utility of the ACD weapon system to the warfighter as well as testing requirements for new capabilities.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Air Force Defensive Cyberspace Operations weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>In FY20, PE 0306250F, Cyber Operations Technology Development efforts were transferred to PE 0208097F, Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) efforts in order to enable Executive Agent oversight and management and to provide adequate oversight and Service stakeholder transparency.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) provides Combatant Commanders, Joint Force Commanders and Service Component Commanders with enhanced situational awareness and battle management for cyberspace operations missions and forces. JCC2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated JCC2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands (CCMD).

It will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations, reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Capabilities will be developed to address the Cyber Mission Forces used to conduct cyber operations.  Additionally, it will leverage and utilize the Continuous Infrastructure/Continuous Development (CI/CD) Framework (a cyber factory) to pace development with warfighter need. JCC2 development activities include, but are not limited to: rapid prototyping, development of software/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations; risk reduction for emerging technologies; and development and assessment of operational systems for inclusion into JCC2 to meet capability requirements.  The increase in funds will enable greater capacity to react to emerging requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605831F.

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) provides Combatant Commanders, Joint Force Commanders and Service Component Commanders with enhanced situational awareness and battle management for cyberspace operations missions and forces. JCC2 establishes congressionally directed focal point to provide integrated JCC2 solutions to all echelons for execution of cyberspace operations to enable and accelerate planning/collaboration between Cyber Mission Forces and Combatant Commands (CCMD).

It will integrate Cyber C2 with Joint, Coalition and inter-agency C2 to enhance multi-domain operations, reduce planning time, improve decision quality and speed resulting in a shorter kill chain. Capabilities will be developed to address the Cyber Mission Forces used to conduct cyber operations.  Additionally, it will leverage and utilize the Continuous Infrastructure/Continuous Development (CI/CD) Framework (a cyber factory) to pace development with warfighter need. JCC2 development activities include, but are not limited to: rapid prototyping, development of software/hardware systems; integration and transition of lab developed cyber capabilities to the warfighter; testing and evaluation; program management administration, studies, analysis, pilots, demonstrations; risk reduction for emerging technologies; and development and assessment of operational systems for inclusion into JCC2 to meet capability requirements.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver JCC2 capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, 0605832F, 0605898F, and 0605833F.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>JCC2 is pre-Material Development Decision (MDD). JCC2 will apply agile acquisition tenets to the programmatic, design/engineering, test and delivery aspects to provide an ability to deliver Situational Awareness/C2 capabilities to the warfighter in a rapid manner. JCC2 will transition from a collection of distinct, special-purpose tools to an integrated joint capability to reduce overall lifecycle costs, improve interoperability, and increase information sharing across the CCMDs. JCC2 PMO will seek the new Software Acquisition Pathway as a long-term acquisition strategy. The IT-Box approach instills rigor for capability deployments and documentation for JCC2 while utilizing multiple middle tier acquisition designations allow the program to proceed with the DevSecOps pace. The JCC2 program office will utilize new and existing contract vehicles and concept, development, risk management, production, or deployment plans as part of a streamlined approach. The JCC2 program office will establish continuous integration/continuous development pipeline to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements. The JCC2 program will execute the agile development requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service JCC2 governance structure. The initial JCC2 capability will deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use. Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities incrementally building the JCC2 capability to match warfighter needs. The JCC2 baseline capability relies on extensive development and evaluation efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities. The decision to develop joint capabilities moved from FY22 to FY21.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Unified Platform provides the Cyber Mission Forces, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), AF Major Commands, and Service cyber components a Joint cyber operations infrastructure enabling full spectrum cyberspace operations at the operational through tactical levels of warfare as part of USCYBERCOM (JCWA) Joint Cyber Warfare Architecture.  The DoD, AF, and the Cyber Mission Force require an interconnected and interoperable cyber infrastructure to conduct integrated planning and execution of cyberspace operations to meet Combatant Commander requirements.  Unified Platform delivers this capability through the integration of disparate firing platforms, existing or evolving systems, infrastructure, mission capabilities, data analytics, and programs used for military cyber operations to build interoperable and scalable network for cyber capabilities.  A common, Unified Platform allows the DoD to achieve and maintain decision and operational superiority, the key to successful cyber operations within the highly dynamic cyberspace domain.

Foundational Efforts provide for the research, development, prototype maturation, integration, enhancement, delivery, and enduring product support of the Unified Platform capability to ensure responsiveness to warfighter requirements within operationally relevant timeframes.  With the government as the lead integrator, Unified Platform Foundational Efforts provide a flexible—yet disciplined—agile development/security/operations (DevSecOps) capability to generate new capabilities, integrate existing and emerging technologies, incorporate rapid prototyping efforts, and evolve the Unified Platform baseline on an agile basis.  Foundational efforts include both the management of the DevSecOps capabilities including systems engineering, risk management, contracting, test, and program management as well as the active research and capability development to be conducted for the Unified Platform baseline.  Foundational efforts are informed in part by Unified Platform prototyping efforts (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, BPACs 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBERCOM Prototyping.

The Secretary of the Air Force leads the Unified Platform effort as Executive Agent on behalf of the Department of Defense.  Unified Platform directly supports the Joint Network Attack Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO), USCYBERCOM operational directives, the latest MAJCOM Offensive Cyberspace Operations System Flight Plan, and other formal requirements documents.

This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver Unified Platform weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F

This program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Foundational Efforts ensure the perpetual capability development, integration, and delivery of the Unified Platform capability through the rapid and agile development of requirements via a DevSecOps pipeline.  Unified Platform requirements are warfighter-derived under the framework of validated Unified Platform requirement documents and met using agile development teams, integration of Service and U.S. Cyber Command capabilities, or external prototyping activities.

Unified Platform capabilities are developed within the government-lead Unified Platform Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment DevSecOps pipeline, leveraging a common pipeline baseline maintained by Platform One.  This pipeline provides a common system development, integration, and staging environment to permit collaborative development.  Developmental efforts will be continuously verified for security compliance and continually tested to ensure development meets established security and performance criteria.

Foundational Efforts also include program office expertise at multiple operating locations in the areas of cyberspace, systems engineering, risk management framework, scaled agile framework, contracting, and program management to ensure that agile acquisition development planning and frequent customer engagement is accomplished.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Unified Platform represents a flexible, interoperable, and scalable warfighter capability to be employed by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in conjunction with U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).  In order to match the speed of need of the highly dynamic cyberspace domain, the Service-agnostic Unified Platform implements an agile development framework to facilitate the rapid development, integration, and fielding of capabilities to remain responsive to evolving warfighter requirements.  The Unified Platform program develops capability in response to requirements provided by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and USCYBERCOM stakeholders in accordance with the prioritization provided by the multi-Service Unified Platform governance structure.

The initial Unified Platform capability delivered a minimum viable product (MVP) for immediate deployment and operational use by the Cyber Mission Force.  Subsequent build iterations will continue to deliver enhanced capabilities, incrementally building the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter needs and requirements to achieve cyberspace dominance.  Early development of the Unified Platform baseline capability relies on extensive rapid prototyping efforts to analyze integration constraints and opportunities of Service-specific cyber capabilities to realize the Unified Platform MVP and inform the future Unified Platform baseline (BA 4, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 646504 AF Prototyping and 646505 USCYBEROM Prototyping).  In parallel, an enduring foundational Unified Platform thrust area supports the development and maturation of Unified Platform baseline, integrates successful prototyping activities, and implements an agile development/security/operations (DevSecOps) construct to rapidly evolve and enhance the Unified Platform capability to match warfighter requirements (BA 7, PE 0208099F Unified Platform, 672281 Foundational Efforts).

The Unified Platform program office utilizes Concept, Development, Risk management, Production, and Deployment Plans as part of a streamlined approach to agile acquisition planning.   All plans contain sufficient information to inform acquisition decisions (i.e., authorities to proceed), within the agile framework, to determine readiness to enter into the applicable phase of the acquisition process.  Unified Platform will utilize both new and existing contractual vehicles, such as Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) vehicles (Alliant, Encore II, Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV (SEWP IV), and General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules, a Cyber Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, Other Transaction Authority (OTA), DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI), Commercial Solution Openings (CSO), Partnership Intermediary Agreements (PIA), Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts, and Small Disadvantaged Business 8(a) contracts. The use of multiple-award contractual vehicles will provide a wide range of commercially-available products and services that will meet any future requirements related to Unified Platform.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

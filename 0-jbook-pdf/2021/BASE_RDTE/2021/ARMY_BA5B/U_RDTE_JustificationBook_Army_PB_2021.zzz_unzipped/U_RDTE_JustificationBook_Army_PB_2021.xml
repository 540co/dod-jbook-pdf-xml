            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (CATT) represent a family of combined arms simulation systems designed to support the Army's simulation-based, Combined Arms Training Strategy. The CATT program portfolio directly supports the Army's Training Strategy and progressive training model by providing realistic training events and comprehensive After Action Reviews (AAR). CATT enables units, from crew to the battalion task force level, to conduct a wide variety of combat tasks on a realistic, interactive, synthetic battlefield.  CATT's combination of manned simulators and staff officer workstations enables units to train as a combined arms team in a cost effective manner.  The primary CATT system is the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) which provides the underlying baseline architecture and AAR for CATT expansions, Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and system enhancements.  The Reconfigurable Vehicle Simulator (RVS) supports combat convoy operations and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) tasks.  Synthetic Environment (SE) Core provides for the expansion of the synthetic environment baseline to include enhanced interoperability and the products and infrastructure to support current and future combat operations and mission rehearsal.  The first synthetic environments expanded were in the Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) and the CCTT for both the Active and Reserve components.  Gaming Technology provides an application to train and rehearse convoy-operations, platoon level, mounted infantry tactics, dismounted operations, rules-of-engagement training, cross-cultural communications training, IED defeat training, route clearance, ground-air coordination, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) integration, and other small unit and individual training and mission rehearsal requirements.  Soldiers can train in a common environment on geotypical or geospecific virtual terrain.  It is also possible to link Gaming technology to actual communication, command, control, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems and other CATT simulation systems to increase the utility and realism of the training.  By practicing skills in CATT, units are able to effectively prepare for costly live fire and maneuver exercises, as well as training tasks deemed too hazardous to conduct in a live training environment. Fielded in both fixed site and mobile versions, CATT enables both Active and Reserve component units to prepare for real world contingency missions.  By being able to use a wide array of training terrain databases and modify the behavior of the computer generated opposing forces, CATT offers an unlimited array of training options to support the Army's many regional combat missions.  The combination of tough field and live fire training, and realistic simulation training in CATT, is the formula to prepare Soldiers and their Leaders for the uncertainties they face in combat operations.

FY 2021 base funding of $3.568 million for SE Core will continue the development of the Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC) to ensure that the process remains Army Geospatial Center (AGC) certified, in addition to, ensuring that the terrain data remains concurrent with supported training systems in fulfilling its synthetic terrain requirements.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Games for Training (GFT) Program prepares Soldiers and Leaders for executing Unified Land Operations by delivering robust training and mission rehearsal capabilities. The GFT program satisfies the Active, National Guard, and Army Reserves' educational requirements in the Operational, Institutional, and Self-Development Training Domains with a low-overhead, flexible, persistent training capability on geo-specific and geo-typical terrain that is relevant with all military platforms and weapon systems. This gaming capability allows units and commanders to train individual and collective tasks at the company and below level with minimal amount of resourcing required (land, ammunition, transportation, etc.) in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) 2028. Through the use of GFT systems, commanders are able to refine and rehearse unit Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) prior to executing live, large-scale training events. GFT trains higher echelon units and staffs by facilitating Tactical Exercises Without Troops (TEWT).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>OPA funding provides concurrency of the Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) software that provides the Army enterprise use rights. Additionally, OPA funding conducts the procurement and fielding of the Stryker Virtual Collective Trainers (SVCT), new gaming hardware suites, and gaming system refreshes to meet Army Risk Management Framework (RMF) requirements. The GFT program will also provide other commercial off the-shelf (COTS) and Government off the-shelf (GOTS) software applications used to train Active, Reserve, and Army National Guard soldiers in a PC based, shared environment.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The acquisition strategy supports Army-wide gaming software for a commercial game based training system with government data rights, Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3), and associated Games for Training system cyber compliant hardware. The GFT RMF compliant hardware system consists of a common desktop or laptop computer, headset, and peripherals; this hardware is configured as gaming suites and is fielded to 88 various Army locations. In support of its fielding efforts, the GFT program acquires fielding support to provide logistical provisioning for the de-confliction and coordination with receiving locations as well as oversight for meeting network and cyber requirements. Additionally, program acquires technical support to provide system monitoring of the GFT hardware and software configuration to ensure compliance with Army's RMF requirements.

In FY 2018, the GFT Program was directed to complete divestment by the end of FY 2023, due to the requirement for training at the company echelon and below using gaming technologies being provided by the Synthetic Training Environment (STE) starting in FY 2021.  In order to meet this desired end state, the program conducted the following contractual efforts in FY 2019: (1) Awarded a hardware procurement contract in 2nd quarter of FY 2019 through the ARMY Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solution (CHESS) program for the planned GFT Classroom Suites and Technical Refreshes scheduled in FY 2019 and FY 2020. (2) Awarded an IT Services Contract in 2nd quarter of FY 2019 to provide network technical support, and to facilitate the program's cybersecurity strategy for its fielded systems through FY 2023. (3) Issued a Task Order award in 3rd quarter of FY 2019 to acquire fielding and logistics support for planned GFT Classroom Fieldings slated in FY 2019 and FY 2020.  The aforementioned contractual efforts will support the program achieving Full Operational Capability (FOC) in FY 2020 (all 115 BOIP Cyber Compliant Classroom Suites will be installed). After FOC, the program will commence sustainment of all fielded GFT Systems through FY 2022, followed by a Divestment Period beginning in FY 2023 and completing by the end of the fiscal year.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the Synthetic Environment Core (SE Core) Program. The SE Core Program is a foundational element and the only provider of correlated terrain for the Army's Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Training Environment (LVC ITE) that links Army training systems and simulators into an integrated and interoperable environment.  SE Core's mission is to ensure that Army systems and simulators support U.S. Army Readiness by providing visual models (buildings and vehicles), terrain (over which the simulator moves), and entity behaviors (models performing realistic and appropriate actions such as movement and weapon effects) that are relevant and realistic in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) 2028. As the exclusive provider of correlated terrain, SE Core ensures that all Army simulators/operators receive terrain that allows for a "Fair Fight" capability; that is, no one will have an inherent advantage over another because training did not occur on a "level playing field".  Fair Fight allows air and ground forces to hold coordinated and integrated training events that accurately replicate combat operations for a train-as-we-fight capability.  

A major component of the program is the SE Core-developed Standard Terrain Database Generation Capability (STDGC), the process used to build the terrain and models that the simulators and simulations employ. The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) gave SE Core its highest rating, the "Gold Standard", based on the quality of the STDGC process and the geospatial data generated by it.  The program has been a certified, AGC co-producer of geospatial data since 2014.  In addition to the correlated terrain databases and common visual models, SE Core components include Virtual One Semi-Automated Forces (Virtual OneSAF) (the computer generated force behaviors for virtual systems); the virtual systems architecture; and mission command development. 

FY 2021 base funding of $3.568 million for SE Core will continue the development of the STDGC to ensure that the process remains AGC certified, in addition to, ensuring that the terrain data remains concurrent with supported training systems in fulfilling its synthetic terrain requirements.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The SE Core program is post Milestone B and will remain in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase for the remainder of its lifecycle. SE Core is a "software only" program that continuously develops terrain, virtual models and other software products for integration into existing training systems. It does not field products to the end user, therefore the program will not require a Milestone C decision or go into the Production phase. The SE Core program is developing the software tools and processes to develop the Army's common virtual environment to link simulation devices [to include: Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Aviation Close Combat tactical Trainer (AVCATT) , Games for Training (GFT), Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC), Fires Simulation (FIRESIM), One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)] into an interoperable environment and maintaining the synthetic terrain, models, and virtual OneSAF for the Army's Integrated Training Environment (ITE) concept.

The government awarded Increment 2 as a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Leidos in August 2011 with a period of performance start date of December 2011. Leidos was formerly known as Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). This contract has a one-year base with four one-year options. The government exercised the first option in December 2012, the second option in December 2013, the third option in December 2014 and the fourth option in December 2015. The government awarded a final delivery order in December 2016 that extended the period of performance of the Increment 2 contract into December 2017.  The contract was extended an additional six months to June 2018 while the Increment 3 contract was competed.

In April 2018, in keeping with the original SE Core acquisition strategy of continuous development, the government awarded the Increment 3 contract as a single award, CPFF, IDIQ with a one year base and four one-year options and a target end date of FY 2023.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The government awarded a single award, cost plus fixed fee (CPFF), indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Applied Visual Technologies, a minority owned, small disadvantaged business, in December 2012. The period of performance of the base contract is through December 2017. Additional tasks are exercised through delivery orders which each have multiple options for development. The most recently awarded RDTE effort was on the fourth delivery order, awarded in September 2014, which included options for gunnery enhancements, integrated data modem development, training environment virtualization, aviation mission planning software development, maintenance tool kit development, manned unmanned teaming, and AH-64E concurrency development.

The government awarded a single award, CPFF, IDIQ services contract to Cole Engineering Services, Inc, a small business, in September 2015.  The period of performance of the base contract is through September 2020.   The third task order, awarded in June 2016, included hardware modernization development and Windows 10 research and testing.  

AVCATT utilizes small business competitively awarded contract vehicles when able. Currently small businesses are conducting development for dynamic terrain enhancements, NCM3 development, and training effectiveness analysis.

The AVCATT program is post Milestone C. Although the system is in the production phase, continuous research, development, testing, and engineering is required in order to maintain concurrency with the real world aircraft and systems that the AVCATT simulates in the virtual training environment. The AVCATT program has fielded the full base order of issue of 23 suites but continues to release incremental hardware and software upgrades at approximate semiannual intervals.  RDTE efforts will not continue in FY 2020, as system begins its transition into sustainment.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Project FG7 Emerging Technology Initiatives was created in support of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). This project was realigned to PE 0605054A (PROJECT FI3) Emerging Technologies Initiatives in FY 2019 for greater transparency of the Army RCO efforts.  

System of Systems Engineering and Integration (SoSE&amp;I) Directorate will be changing names to the Office of the Chief Systems Engineer in FY19.

Network Integration Exercise (NIE) activity will be referred to as Enduring Assessments starting in FY20 (to include events like the Joint Warfighter Assessments (JWAs).</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This program element is comprised of five projects: Enduring Assessments (Joint Warfighter Assessment (JWA); Production/Field Coordination for Capability Sets; Army Systems Engineering, Architecture &amp; Analysis; Army Integration Management &amp; Coordination; and Emerging Technology Initiatives. The specific evaluation requirements will support Mission Command Network (MCN) 2020, the Force 2025 objectives, and emerging technology insertion.

Project DY3: Enduring Assessments Test &amp; Evaluation, synchronizes, integrates, and manages system and System of Systems (SoS) network capability evaluations in laboratory and operational environments in order to inform Army force modernization decisions that impact network improvements, interoperability compliance, operational readiness, and exploitable technology opportunities.

Project DY5: Production/Fielding Coordination for Capability Sets, provides for the development of a synchronized Brigade/Division level plan for the Production equipment delivery and Fielding (hand-off logistics and new equipment training) of Capability Set (CS) components (both hardware/software in A and/or B Kits) upon completion of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Army CS fielding decision.

Project DY7: Army System Engineering, Architecture &amp; Analysis, provides the Army's leadership and materiel developers with the necessary modernization planning, System of Systems (SoS) engineering, technical analysis, architectural products, critical path analysis, and risk analysis and mitigation planning to influence the Army's materiel portfolio. This project also explicitly funds Cyber Security engineering, architecture and development tasks necessary to create effective, affordable and secure network capabilities that address critical gaps, meet Mission Command Network (MCN) 2020 objectives and/or Force 2025 and Beyond (F2025B) initiatives. Integration of Army defensive/offensive cyber and Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) capabilities into the overall CS design, Multinational/Mission Partner Environments architecture development at both the tactical and enterprise levels, network modernization risks/gaps for Corps level units and below, and Army spectrum strategy.

Project DZ6: Army Integration Management &amp; Coordination funds resources that support the technical and management (i.e. headquarters, resource management, acquisition, human resources, and operations) aspects of the Army Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO).

Project FG7: Emerging Technology Initiatives, will fund prototyping and demonstration of selected technology enabled capabilities to defeat emerging threats against ground, aviation, command, control, communications &amp; reconnaissance systems and equipment, precision weapons, and Soldier equipment. Funding facilitates maturation and demonstration of emerging technologies and systems in relevant varied environments and tactical/operational scenarios. The focus is to mature technologies with a goal of initial production, limited fielding, and transition to a Program of Record in an Army or DoD Program Management Office.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Coordinating, conducting, and analyzing system and system of systems network and non-network specific requirements through use of various information session conducted through the Bull Pen process, Initial Planning Conference, Mid Planning Session and Final Planning Conferences. Information sessions assisted in establishing and confirming JWA requirements with various stakeholders to include multi-national participation to establish and lock network architecture and resource management to ensure successful execution of the various phases associated with JWA 19 being conducted at unit?s home station.  

Development of Unit specific network architecture diagrams through use of various network critical designs reviews with PMs, Vendors, and Unit personnel. Architecture products developed and captured network standards, routing schemes, processes and protocols required to establish, configure and validate the various system and system of system network connections associated with building and maintaining the JWA network. Architecture products allowed positive control of network system configurations to inform and maintain through JWA.   

Developing a Validation Exercise (VALEX) plan that configures and checks out the system of systems prior to the exercise; assigning unit locations within the VALEX location; identifying and resolving security and cyber assurance issues associated with running classified and/ or coalition network operations; validating all Information Assurance Accreditations for networked C4ISR systems, and developing of technical mission threads used to validate the capabilities.

These funds also supported defining the network system configurations and routing schemes for each event.

Preparation:
These funds supported efforts leading up to the execution of the assessment exercise, to include Risk Reductions Events(s), vehicle integration design and build, safety release, and conducting of VALEX.

The Risk Reduction Events (RRE(s)) efforts were conducted in controlled home station environment (JBLM) to identify and resolve integration, configuration and interoperability issues prior to assessments. RRE1 was the stage sitter for initial network functional testing, routing, and thread testing.  RRE2 was the stage sitter for initial integration of the coalition partner?s networks and the PORs.  The development of technical threads assisted in validating network functionality prior to VALEX and allowed modification of network and routing schemes. 

These funds provided for integration efforts such as design of installation kits on tactical platforms; fabrication of specialized cables, metal plates, racks, and brackets to enable platform installation/integration; and safety release testing. The scope of the integration effort also included planning for Field Service Representatives (FSRs) and other technical support personnel, coordination and movement of the Fleet vehicles, and inventory management of systems.  Following completion of platform integration efforts, these funds supported a structured network VALEX consisting of four subordinate efforts: Load Exercise (LOADEX), ESTABLISH, INTEGRATE, and VALIDATE.

In FY 2020 the Joint Warfighter Assessment (JWA), a key component of the Army's Force 2025 Maneuvers, will occur in Europe in support of US Army Europe and US European Command. The JWA is used to assess interim solutions to Army Warfighting Challenges. The JWA concept maximizes collective resources to advance joint and multinational interoperability, future force development, and unit training readiness priorities. Concepts and capabilities are embedded in a live, virtual, and constructive Multinational Division (MND) exercise that is representative of current and future operational environments. The JWA provides a unique opportunity to increase innovation, improve interoperability, and enhance unit readiness. JWA offers the triple pay-off with future force development, training readiness, and Joint / Multinational interoperability assessment opportunities. These funds support the following major efforts associated with an assessment:

- Planning: Coordination with multiple stakeholders on the participation and resourcing of personnel, services, equipment and prototypes, and other deliverables needed for risk reduction events, capability and platform integration, training, field support and logistics, event battle rhythm/schedule, and developing network data products.
- Preparation: Conduct risk reduction, complete system integrated designs and builds, build prototype vehicles for safety release, conduct system installation and checkout, validate the network, and obtain Information Assurance certifications. A key preparation task is the full scale live network validation event, which includes Cyber Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment of the network. This ensures the technical architecture and security procedures are place to support an exercise of this scale and complexity. Additionally, preparation efforts will supports new system user training.
- Execution: Technical and logistics support during soldier-led assessments, trouble ticket management and closeout, and field support management.
- Close-out: Inventorying platforms/systems, de-installing equipment, returning platforms to their original configurations. All unit equipment will be returned to original configuration following the exercise to ensure unit is fully prepared to execute wartime mission. The final close out task is conduct of After Action Review (AAR) and capture of lessons learned both for systems and architecture, as well as process and procedures for support exercises. 

These funds may also be used for procuring limited equipment and materials (to include prototypes, when required), event infrastructure, field services, personnel support (government and contractor), and travel. These funds may also support similar activities for smaller assessment events leading up to the Joint Warfighter Assessment. Additionally, these funds will support initial planning for the Joint Warfighter 21, scheduled to support US Pacific Command and US Army Pacific. Planning events may occur at home station or require travel to support unit locations. Planning activities will include things such as concept and capability solicitation, initial architecture considerations, and logistics planning.</r2:Text>

Fielding/Integration Coordination for CS/ITN/SFAB:

Developed, coordinated, and managed execution of the CS Fielding plan needed to produce, integrate, and field NIE tested Brigade improvements to the BCTs. Synchronized the integration and coordinated CS Fielding including CS18 closeout, CS19 execution, and detail plan for CS20 along with initial planning for CS21/22. This effort funded government and contractor personnel and travel to unit location and fielding sites for planning and coordination of resources, integrated schedule, training and fielding across CS Programs of Record (PoR).  It does not fund the production, physical integration, or fielding of the CS.

Production/Fielding Coordination for CS18 Products and Services:

Completed training and fielding of CS 18 units.  These efforts had a start date in FY 2018 and continued into FY 2019.  This included two (2) IBCTs (one (1) OCONUS), and one (1) SFAB. Final close out of CS 18 units including Materiel Fielding documentation and After Action Reports (AARs). 

Production/Fielding Coordination for CS19 Products and Services:

Synchronized the integration of the CS package into the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) consisting of multiple network systems mounted on the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle (MATV) and various configurations of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) platforms, at multiple locations. Completed synchronization, coordination, integration, new equipment training and new equipment fielding of Capability Set Systems for the following CS19 Units (two (2) total OCONUS IBCTs; and two (2) SFABs. Coordinated the integrated designs by platform, role, echelon, and BCT for CS19 including LTI. Finalized CS18 fielding requirements that carried over into FY19. Conducted Synchronization Conferences and New Material Introductory Briefings.  Planning included both Capability Set Systems, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle and Ground Mobility Vehicle.  Developed and managed the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for CS19. Developed Master Schedule to ensure that fielding/integrations schedules were executable with A-Kit design, development and production and B-Kit's Integration Kit (IK) design, between system and platform Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) for CS19. Coordinated the delivery of prototype and production builds for CS19. Supported Configuration Management (CM) of platform configuration implementations, designs, A-Kits, and B-Kits. Supported fielding integration of Program of Record (PoR) assets in accordance with the defined BCT network architecture. Coordinated planning and execution of unit meetings, site inventories, A/B kit deliveries, vehicle installation schedules, assessment vehicles to ensure Fully Mission Capable condition and integration of vehicle schedules (both component and complete vehicle installations). Coordinated and published a synchronized New Equipment Training /New Equipment Fielding (NET/NEF) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for CS19 gaining units.

Production/Fielding Coordination for CS20 Products and Services:

Conducted synchronization and coordination of CS Fielding for the following CS20 Units (two (2) total): field Capability Set systems to two (2) OCONUS SBCTs.  Conducted Synchronization Conferences and New Material Introductory Briefings with respective CS BCTs.  Synchronized the New Equipment Training and New Equipment Fielding schedule with each unit?s Long Range Training Schedule.  Executed a synchronized New Equipment Training /New Equipment Fielding (NET/NEF) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for fielding of CS20 to all gaining units. Began CS20-21 NET/NEF requirements definition finalization and development of the NET/NEF integrated master schedule.  Planned and participated in the synchronization and coordination of vehicle integration for three (3) SFABs during FY20.  Developed vehicle integration schedule and began vehicle tracking documentation for the future SFAB builds.  This includes scheduling Program of Record unique NET, System of Systems NET (Capability Set holistic classes), and property accountability handoffs as an integrated process to enhance efficiency of the brigade modernization events.

Engineering and Integration coordination/planning efforts to develop and maintain CS unit-specific Network Basis of Issue (NBOI) architecture and Integrated Master Schedule (IMS):

Developed and maintained unit-specific NBOI and IMS for the Army?s Capability Set ? Synchronized Fielding (CSSF) efforts.  Prepared ?as-built? NBOI and final IMS for units fielded during FY19, maintained unit-specific NBOI and IMS for units designated to undergo CS integration in FY 2020-2021, and developed initial (draft-level) NBOI and IMS for planned units in FY 2022 thru FY 2023.  Organized, prepared, and conducted incremental technical reviews to examine and assess key/crucial planning activities and associated data product development supporting CS integration at specific fielded locations.  Collected and analyzed sub-schedule performance against the baseline IMS to identify schedule risks for the Army?s CSSF efforts. Validated that established incremental integration points were achievable and, if not, identified the risk to schedule.  Analyzed schedule and cost performance against established baselines, identified variances and their causes, and identified risks and/or impacts to critical path. Performed ?what if? schedule and cost analyses of alternative program courses of action to determine impact on schedule critical path and mission requirements. Updated and posted schedules on SharePoint for visibility and increased collaboration across the entire CS community to include ASA(ALT). Led or participated in other key technical reviews to include: After Action Reviews, Lessons Learned, Synchronized Fielding Technical Exchange Meetings (TEMs) and mini-TEMs.  Provided reports and briefings to key CS stakeholders to support mutual programmatic goals and objectives and to help resolve issues and concerns affecting the CS community at-large.  Identified key program risks as well as specific risk mitigation plans.  Coordinated, prepared, and published a synchronized New Equipment Training / New Equipment Fielding (NET/NEF) Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for CS fielding to all gaining units.

Developed NBOI and horse blankets for 2 SFABs executed during FY 2019 and one for FY 2020.  Developed initial draft documents for remaining FY 2020 SFABs.  Coordinated with ASA(ALT), TCMs, FORSCOM and SFAC to align vehicles to specific locations with the formation and further led the effort to identify roles to support the data product builds.</r2:Text>

Developed and maintained unit-specific NBOI and IMS for the Army?s Capability Set ? Synchronized Fielding (CSSF) efforts.  Prepared ?as-built? NBOI and final IMS for units fielded during FY 2019, maintained unit-specific NBOI and IMS for units designated to undergo CS integration in FY 2020-2021, and developed initial (draft-level) NBOI and IMS for planned units in FY 2021 thru FY 2023.  Organized, prepared, and conducted incremental technical reviews to examine and assess key/crucial planning activities and associated data product development supporting CS integration at specific fielded locations.  Collected and analyzed sub-schedule performance against the baseline IMS to identify schedule risks for the Army?s CS SF efforts. Validated that established incremental integration points were achievable and, if not, identified the risk to schedule.  Analyzed schedule and cost performance against schedule established baselines, identified variances and their causes, and identified risks and/or impacts to critical path. Performed ?what if? schedule and cost analyses of alternative program courses of action to determine impact on schedule critical path and mission requirements. Updated and posted schedules on SharePoint for visibility and increased collaboration across the entire CS community to include ASA (ALT). Led or participated in other key technical reviews to include: After Action Reviews, Lessons Learned, Synchronized Fielding Technical Exchange Meetings (TEMs) and mini-TEMs.  Provided reports and briefings to key CS stakeholders to support mutual programmatic goals and objectives and to help resolve issues and concerns affecting the CS community at-large.  Identified key program risks as well as specific risk mitigation plans.

                                        <r2:Text>Army Formation Reference Architecture products:

Delivered an integrated Network Basis of Issue (NBOI) and associated System of Systems (SoS) Views and Platform Interconnectivity Diagrams (PID) to drive engineering and integration activities across the Program Executive Offices (PEO) and Program Managers (PM) for the fielding of equipment to Security Forces Assistance Brigade 2, the Capability Set 19 Integrated Tactical Network fielding for 1-82nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and Special Forces Group mobile radio fielding. These products enabled the ASA (ALT) community to determine integrated Basis of Issue planning, subnet design, spectrum allocation, network initialization, logistics planning for fielding activity, and non-recurring engineering planning and design as part of the overall ASA (ALT) engineering, integration and fielding of the Army Capability Sets.

Developed and delivered Capability Set 21 Integrated Tactical Network reference NBOI, SoS View, and PIDs for the Infantry, Armored, and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams. The ITN is the Army's priority for tactical network modernization and OCSE's architecture products continued to establish the organization as a subject matter experts in system of systems engineering, design and architecture. These efforts have directly informed Joint Warfighter Assessment (JWA) 19, 1-82nd DevOps, and Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) planning as well as identify early engineering design and integration planning and issues with PEO Ground Combat Systems (GCS) and PEO Combat Support and Combat Service Support (CS&amp;CSS) platforms and enabling the Network Cross Functional Team?s (CFT) Cyber Table Top Exercise.

Developed and delivered the Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) End to End (E2E) Systems Architecture, a system of systems architecture model that took the work originating from the CFT Horizontal Integration Pilot and expanded to include the current-force and legacy baseline system of systems. The model served as a foundational baseline for PEOs and CFTs to reference off of to identify dependencies, interfaces, gaps, and potential network requirements. This product was explicitly shared, collaborated with, and requested by action officers at PEO Command Control Communication-Tactical (C3T), PEO Soldier, PEO Missiles and Space (M&amp;S), PEO GCS, PEO CS&amp;CSS, Network CFT, Assured Position, Navigation, and Timing (APNT) CFT, Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) CFT, and Future Vertical Lift (FVL) CFT stakeholders involved in the Army's Army Modernization Eco-system (i.e. Future Force Modernization Enterprise). The result was an initial baseline end to end architecture representing all Army Futures Command (AFC) priority modernization initiatives that could be used by each CFT to begin identifying gaps. The End to End Architecture was provided to ASA (ALT) and AFC leadership up to the 4-star level as well as each CFT Director.

Developed and delivered Sensor to Shooter (S2S) reference network architecture proposal to Sensor Task Force, CFT APNT, and other key organizations to address the Army Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance platforms and tactical sensors' lack of ability to sense and understand across the depth and breadth of the multi-domain battlespace. Facilitated acceptance from the S2S community for the proposed plan for a S2S reference architecture as a guide for the integration of current and future sensing and effects systems into a single interconnected, automated, agile and resilient system of systems to be demonstrated JWA 20 and Defender Pacific 20.

Engineering Design &amp; Analysis:

Conducted the engineering and integration activities across CFT emerging capabilities that resulted in the identification of forty-seven critical findings with associated risks and mitigation strategies for Army leadership. Provided a briefing on the findings to the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE), AFC Commander, CFT Directors, PEOs, and PMs leading the way across the CFTs, PEOs, and PMs for further work and analysis on the findings.

Framed and developed an approach for conducting a quick-turn analysis.  Resultant analyses were developed on the Army network resiliency detailing the requirement to invest Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) waveforms to support redundant, resilient links that span the entire Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) kill-chain, automated Primary-Alternate-Contingency-Emergency (PACE) radio planning requirements and execution methods, and leveraging Secure Unclassified (SBU) communications methods to enable Joint and Partner interoperability. This resulted in three white papers on the overall Army Network Resiliency, Link-16 Scalability Challenges, and Security Classifications Challenges delivered to the Army community including PEO C3T, the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the ITN and CFT Network.

IMS:

In the 1st quarter of FY 2019, these funds provided a reliable IMS that synchronized engineering, architecture, PoRs, network evaluation, and CS fielding schedules that ensured their alignment to the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) cycles. Efforts included implementation of IMS tools for POR input, analyses of Platform schedules, and MCN 2020 network components schedules to identify issues and opportunities. These funds also provided for analysis of Program Executive Office (PEO) portfolios and their IMS which identified opportunities to incorporate capabilities earlier into CS configurations.

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>PE 0604802A Weapons and Munitions - Eng Dev funds multiple efforts for the engineering development of weapons and munitions systems.

Project 613, Mortar Systems: This Project supports Mortar System &amp; Fire Control Modernization (MS&amp;FCM) activities.  The Mortar System and Fire Control Modernization Project funds engineering development and demonstration of new technologies that will support modernized mortar weapon and mortar fire control systems.  This includes capabilities that provide commonality between current and future weapon and fire control systems to help mitigate technology shortfalls and critical capability gaps.  Future mortar systems that address these gaps include (but are not limited to) remote mortar turrets for mounted mortar systems, high-pressure capable cannons/components, and composite/lightweight components for dismounted systems.  Mortar Fire Control Systems capabilities include lightweight inertial measurement and navigation (IMU/INU) units for weapon pointing, simplified Ethernet/wireless-based digital communications interfaces, development of updated fire control software to enable commonality, integration with existing/future platform interfaces, and support for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)/modified commercial off-the-shelf (MCOTS) fire control components.  FY 2021 funding will support development and prototyping of new mortar weapon system and mortar fire control system technologies.     

Project BY1, Next Generation Combat Vehicle Ammunition:  50x228 millimeter (mm) family of ammunition is a critical technology development in response to the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Abbreviated Capability Development Document for weapon qualification, platform integration, and fielding of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle primary weapon system (XM913). This effort includes the development of three capabilities: The XM1202 Target Practice with Trace; the XM1203 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Trace; and the XM1204 High Explosive Airburst with Trace. The training cartridge will allow the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner and the tactical cartridges will provide enhanced lethality at increased ranges when engaging personnel threats in the open, defilade, and under the cover of urban structures, Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM) teams, and current and projected future peer armored materiel threats. This effort is operating under Middle Tier Acquisition authority for rapid prototyping to qualify the three munitions in order to support the NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT) timeline for First Unit Equipped (FUE). FY 2021 funding will support Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for all cartridges.

Project EC4, Non-Standard Simulator Munitions:  This Project will standardize various pyrotechnics that simulate battlefield effects. The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects. These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified or material released and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers. This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/ simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as: Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) simulators to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HiOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire. Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems and mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.  FY 2021 funding will support Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Artillery Airburst and Stinger, Black Smoke, Yellow Smoke, and Micro/Macro pyrotechnics.

Project ED7, Advanced Multipurpose (AMP) Cartridge: This Project supports the XM1147 Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program, a direct fire line of sight 120mm large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank. AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst. AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating ATGM teams from 50m to 2000m threshold and 50m to 4500m objective, a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition. In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles. The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in FY 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015. There is no funding requested in FY 2021.

Project EL9, Ammunition Logistics Prototyping: The Ammunition Logistics Prototyping Project supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This Project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter. FY 2021 funding will be used to continue integrating the munitions health monitoring system with additional ammunition items, improve health monitoring survivability, and conduct qualification tests and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification testing.

Project EP2, Shoulder-Launched Munitions:  The Individual Assault Munition (IAM) will be a lightweight Shoulder Launched Munition (SLM) capability for combat units at the individual Soldier level. As an improvement over existing Shoulder Launched Munitions, the solution will fit within the Soldier Lethality Modernization Priority, by reducing Soldier load, while providing tactical innovation capable of extending overmatch against near-peer adversaries in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict. The IAM will allow Soldiers to conduct Urban Operations with an ability to defeat targets in an open space or in defilade at extended ranges. It will also allow Soldiers to defeat adversaries protected by field expedient structures and light armored vehicles.

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>50x228 millimeter (mm) family of ammunition is a critical technology development in response to the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) Abbreviated Capability Development Document for weapon qualification, platform integration, and fielding of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle primary weapon system (XM913). This effort includes the development of three capabilities: The XM1202 Target Practice with Trace; the XM1203 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot withTrace; and the XM1204 High Explosive Airburst with Trace. The training cartridge will allow the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner and the tactical cartridges will provide enhanced lethality at increased ranges when engaging personnel threats in the open, defilade, and under the cover of urban structures, Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM) teams, and current and projected future peer armored materiel threats. This effort is operating under Middle Tier Acquisition authority for rapid prototyping to qualify the three munitions in order to support the NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT) timeline for First Unit Equipped (FUE).  FY 2021 funding will support Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for all cartridges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EC4 Non-Standard Simulator Munitions will standardize various pyrotechnics that simulate battlefield effects.  The Army's Combat Training Centers (CTCs) are currently using non-standard munitions to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield effects.  These modified commercial-off-the-shelf products have not been type classified or material released and are not safe or sustainable for use by Soldiers.  This effort will develop and demonstrate various pyrotechnics/simulators to replicate both conventional and asymmetric warfare battlefield affects such as:  Black smoke signature (burning vehicles, buildings, and equipment); Yellow smoke signature (chemical, biological or nuclear effects); Macro pyrotechnics to simulate hostile fire and small Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during mounted operations in urban terrain; Micro pyrotechnics to simulate indoor hostile fire and IED effects that are capable of being integrated into existing facilities; Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) simulators to replicate the flight of a Rocket Propelled Grenade; High Order Blast Effect (HiOBE) used to replicate a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), building explosions, and other significant explosive events; Artillery airburst simulator to replicate indirect fire; simulator to replicate a STINGER firing; Tracer Fire-back simulator to replicate enemy small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire.  Standardization will reduce training costs, eliminate redundancies between systems and mitigate environmental concerns and safety risks associated with realistic scenario based training.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The XM1147 Advanced Multi Purpose (AMP) program is a direct fire line of sight 120 millimeter (mm) large caliber munition under development for the Abrams Main Battle Tank.  AMP has three modes of operation including point detonate, point detonate delay, and airburst.  AMP is the materiel solution for breaching double reinforced concrete walls and defeating Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams from 50 Meter (m) to 2000m threshold and 50m to 4500m objective, a validated gap that cannot currently be met with existing stockpiled ammunition.  In addition to added capability, AMP will also consolidate the capabilities of four existing stockpiled 120mm munitions, thereby addressing the users' battlecarry dilemma by allowing them to load a single munition that is capable of defeating multiple targets including ATGM teams, reinforced walls, personnel, light armor, bunkers, and obstacles.  The full performance of the AMP is obtained with an Abrams equipped Ammunition Data Link breech modification, the same required by the 120mm M829A4 cartridge that achieved Milestone C in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and achieved Full Materiel Release in FY 2015.  In FY 2021 there is no funding request.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The XM1147 AMP Program achieved Milestone B and entered EMD in FY 2015.  EMD consists of two phases; Phase 1 awarded two contracts in FY 2015 to competitively prototype.  A cartridge demonstration test was conducted and was used to support down-select to a single contractor for EMD Phase 2, which will lead to Milestone C in 2020 followed by two Low Rate Initial Productions in FY 2020 and FY 2021 and one optional year of full procurement in FY 2022.  Explore options to increase future competition and facilitate effective training.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EL9 Ammunitions Logistics Prototyping supports the future force by improving the distribution, management, reliability and survivability of ammunition through the advanced development, integration, and demonstration of logistics system enablers. These enablers will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ammunition operations, to include retrograde, while reducing the logistics footprint on the battlefield. Technology areas addressed include handling, distribution, and management (strategic and tactical), prognostics, diagnostics, and asset visibility, explosives safety, and adaptive and environmentally friendly packaging and palletization. The efficient deployment and sustainment of reliable ammunition is vital to success on the battlefield. This project enhances the operational effectiveness of the ammunition logistics system to ensure the distribution of reliable ammunition to the warfighter.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will continue integrating the munitions health monitoring system with additional ammunition items, improve health monitoring survivability, and conduct qualification tests and continue to integrate passive time/temperature exposure sensors with additional ammunition items and conduct qualification testing.  All research and development initiatives will be supporting the cross functional teams and the multi domain operations modernization objectives through deployment of prototypes for user evaluation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Individual Assault Munition (IAM) will be a lightweight Shoulder Launched Munition (SLM) capability for combat units at the individual Soldier level. As an improvement over existing Shoulder Launched Munitions, the solution will fit within the Soldier Lethality Modernization Priority, by reducing Soldier load, while providing tactical innovation capable of extending overmatch against near-peer adversaries in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict.  The IAM will allow Soldiers to conduct Urban Operations with an ability to defeat targets in an open space or in defilade at extended ranges.  It will also allow Soldiers to defeat adversaries protected by field expedient structures and light armored vehicles. This solution will be effective day or night with the ability to safely engage targets from within enclosures using single hearing protection, increasing Soldier survivability. This solution will combine the capabilities of the existing Bunker Defeat Munition (BDM) and the AT4 Confined Space - Reduced Sensitivity (AT4CS-RS), which will allow for reduced Soldier load and training complexity, as well as reducing the logistics burden for Light Infantry, Combat Engineers, and Special Operations Forces. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will provide the Army the opportunity to evaluate various developmental munitions to achieve emerging increased capability as an Individual Assault Munition. The Individual Assault Munition Capabilities Development Document (CDD) was approved on 11 March 2016.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>As an improvement over existing Shoulder Launched Munitions, IAM will fit within the Soldier Lethality Modernization Priority, by reducing Soldier load, while providing tactical innovation capable of extending overmatch against near-peer adversaries in a joint, multi-domain, high-intensity conflict.  The IAM will allow Soldiers to conduct Urban Operations with an ability to defeat targets in an open space or in defilade at extended ranges.  It will also allow Soldiers to defeat adversaries protected by field expedient structures and light armored vehicles. This solution will be effective day or night with the ability to safely engage targets from within enclosures using single hearing protection, increasing Soldier survivability. This solution will combine the capabilities of the existing BDM and the AT4CS-RS, which will allow for reduced Soldier load and training complexity, as well as reducing the logistics burden for Light Infantry, Combat Engineers, and Special Operations Forces.</r2:Description>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The small caliber Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) Project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and .50 caliber Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). The overall objective of RRA is to provide training ammunition suitable for use on military installations with Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions. The relatively long maximum range of the 7.62mm and .50 caliber service ammunition poses challenges on training ranges in range restricted areas. RRA will mitigate a training gap on installations by providing a materiel solution that meets training needs while shortening and condensing the SDZ. This will allow soldiers to train with 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons on restricted ranges. The RRA cartridge design will be compatible with all Army 7.62mm and .50 caliber weapons, but specifically optimized to work in the M240 and M2 Machine Guns. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding supports continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts, performing a Technical Readiness Review (TRR), conducting Production Qualification Testing (PQT), and performing activities to prepare for ammunition production transition to the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) on the 7.62mm variant. FY 2021 also includes continuing the EMD effort, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), performing a User Evaluation / Soldier Touch Point (STP), and performing PQT on the 50 caliber variant. FY 2021 includes continuing activities to evaluate RRA ammunition prototypes and designs for the Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The One Way Luminescence (OWL) project is a critical technology development in response to the 7.62 millimeter (mm) and 5.56mm Families of Ammunition Capabilities Development Documents (CDD) and .50 Caliber Munitions CDD. Current small caliber ammunition tracer rounds are a pyrotechnic tracer mix which allows enemy forces to see the trace round and track its trajectory back to the shooter. The OWL projects objective is to develop and field a full tracer round, replace the current pyrotechnic cartridges with trace cartridges that are only visible to the shooter and soldiers in close proximity, increasing soldier survivability, and increasing lethality by incorporating Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) technology into the new tracer ammunition. 7.62mm and 5.56mm are the immediate focus; later followed by .50 Caliber cartridges and Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) ammunition. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support continuing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) efforts, performing Production Qualification Testing (PQT), performing Safety Release Tests, conducting Live-Fire Testing and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E), conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), conducting a Limited User Evaluation (LUE), and performing preparation activities for manufacturing at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP) for the 7.62mm variant. FY 2021 funding will also support EMD efforts, Design Verification Tests (DVT), and preparation for the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the 5.56mm variant. FY 2021 also supports concept development/evaluation of OWL tracer solutions for .50 Caliber weapons and NGSW.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>OWL is a new tracer technology that will be applied to multiple calibers.  The initial focus was on 7.62mm ammunition in FY 2015 followed by 5.56mm in FY 2018; and later followed by the .50 Caliber and NGSW ammunition.  As the technology matured the effort transitioned from BA4 PE 0603639A Tank and Medium Caliber Ammunition Project EB8 One Way Luminescence (OWL) to BA5 PE 0604802A One-Way Luminescence for Small Caliber Ammo Project EP4 One Way Luminescence (OWL) for Small Caliber Ammunition in FY 2019 for 7.62mm, and FY 2021 for 5.56mm.  The OWL cartridge will be compatible with all Army Small Caliber weapon systems, but optimized for Machine Guns and will provide improved lethality / target effects over the current tracer munition.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The OWL concept will be developed through Government and Industry prototyping efforts. Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) were conducted in FY 2017 and FY 2018 to evaluate the industry and Government concepts in order to proceed with the 7.62mm EMD. The 5.56mm, NGSW, and .50 Caliber cartridges will follow the 7.62mm schedule with EMD starting in FY 2021 for the 5.56mm variant. The new tracer cartridges will replace legacy tracers in each of the various small caliber configurations.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Aviation Airborne Expendable Countermeasures (AAECM) will support Integrated System Design (ISD), System Capability (SC) and Manufacturing Process Demonstrations (MPD) on current pyrotechnic munitions and tunable pyrotechnic aircraft countermeasures and decoys to include the XM215 Flare and Radio Frequency (RF) expendables. These expendable countermeasures systems are an essential part of survivability equipment for Army aircraft. Army Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) efforts are coordinated with Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation to address the AAECM capability, a critical enabler for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) - Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) Cross Functional Team (CFT) within Army's Top modernization priorities. 

These advanced decoys will address deficiencies in Army aircraft protection and the safety of its aircrews against advanced Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and shoulder launched Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) systems. The project will also support ISD, SC and MPD on new expendable countermeasure munitions that will protect Army aircraft from advanced and current guided missile threats. Activities include modeling and simulation, flight testing, qualification testing, environmental considerations, safety enhancements, manufacturing enhancements, qualification of other service and foreign munitions that could meet current requirements, product improvements, insertion of new technologies to increase performance, and enhancement of current flare solutions for new and existing aircraft. Systems include impulse cartridges and aircraft expendables (to include RF expendables).  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 will support continued modeling and simulation and developmental testing for RF countermeasures and verification testing for the XM215 design.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The 40mm HV HEDP-AB cartridge will be developed through a competitive EMD program. Milestone B approval was followed by a competitive award for the EMD phase which included DET 1 and DET 2 to enter into DT&amp;E. One contractor was awarded to develop an airburst capable fuze to be retrofitted onto the currently fielded, High Explosive Point Detonating cartridges and develop a Programming Unit.  Test results will support the documentation for Milestone C.  After Milestone C is achieved, a contract will be awarded for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) followed by two options.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 155 millimeter (mm) High Explosive (HE) Rocket Assisted Projectile, Extended Range Project supports the development of materiel solutions to meet the Army's long range precision fires modernization strategy. This Project supports projectile development efforts to achieve ranges of 40 kilometers (km) in current artillery weapon systems (39 caliber tube length) and characterize longer ranges in future artillery weapon systems (58 caliber tube length Extended Range Cannon Artillery, (ERCA).  These efforts will leverage enhanced lethality cannon munition technologies to compensate for increased rocket motor volume. The projectile body will be filled with an insensitive munition (IM) HE and a supplementary charge to improve soldier survivability.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding supports the Urgent Materiel Release (UMR) activities of XM1113 including fire control software integration and development and qualification testing for current artillery systems.  FY 2021 funding will also support the continuation of characterization activities required for a projectile concept compatible with the ERCA weapon systems to achieve the Army's requirement of extended range lethality with precision accuracy by FY 2023.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced Lethality Cannon Munitions (ELCM) Project will evaluate, develop, and qualify new lethality technologies for 155 millimeter (mm) cannon artillery munitions and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating evolving and derived capability gaps, and support transition to production.  The ELCM Project supports testing and assessment of the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Systems M999 advanced anti-personnel munition in support the Army Directed Requirement for a Rapid Bridging Solution for the replacement of the 155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM).   This Project also accelerates the qualification of the 155mm XM1128 High Explosive Projectile, which will replace the M795 Critical Munition once qualified.  Engineering efforts are ongoing and will support the evaluation of the XM1128 test data to determine that the Program is safe, suitable and operationally effective, as well as the gathering of all statutory and regulatory requirements in support of a Milestone C in FY 2021.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, this Project does not have an Research Development Technology &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) request.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 40 millimeter (mm) Low Velocity High Explosive Air Burst (HEAB) is a new capability identified as a Warfighter requirement in the Capability Development Document (CDD), 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Family of Ammunition Annex. The HEAB tactical cartridge allows the Warfighter to engage targets at increased effective ranges using the 40mm M320 Grenade Launcher. The HEAB cartridge provides the grenadier with a higher probability of achieving a first shot kill against enemy personnel, coupled with the ability to defeat personnel targets in defilade positions. When deployed against point and area targets, the cartridge inflicts incapacitating effects against personnel beyond those offered by the current M433 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge. The cartridge provides lethal effects against targets with improved accuracy and greater standoff ranges resulting in increased soldier survivability. Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 will support any remaining Design Engineering Test build; Soldier Touch Point (Limited User Evaluation), Critical Design Review, Test Readiness Reviews (TRRs) and Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) build and test.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The HEAB cartridge will be developed through a competitive EMD program.  Potential designs were evaluated as part of the pre-EMD activities using a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with contractors.  For EMD, the Government awarded two contracts utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through Department of Defense (DoD) Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC). The EMD phase will consist of a series of DETs to assess the Contractors' design progress and ability of achieving the program objectives. Any shortcomings and deficiencies will be addressed prior to final DT&amp;E. After DT&amp;E and a successful Milestone C, the Government will down-select to a single contractor for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and four production year options utilizing a follow-on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based contract.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 30 millimeter (mm) Lethality project funds the development of a suite of 30x173mm caliber cartridges, which includes a High Explosive Airburst with Trace (HEAB-T) cartridge, XM1182, for increased anti-personnel effects, an Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot with Trace (APFSDS-T) cartridge XM1170 for anti-material, and ballistically matched training cartridges; Target Practice with Trace (TP-T) and Target Practice Discarding Sabot with Trace (TPDS-T). A non-developmental airburst munition will be Urgent Materiel Released (UMR) as an interim solution prior to HEAB-T cartridge. The objective is to enhance the operational effectiveness and lethality of the Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV), and any Army Fighting Vehicles that are equipped with a 30x173mm weapon system. The tactical APFSDS-T cartridge will provide an organic direct fire capability to support infantry at a greater range and will improve lethality when engaging light-to-medium armored vehicles. The HEAB-T cartridge will provide the Warfighter with increased lethality against troops in the open, counter defilade, Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) teams, and troops behind urban structures. The training cartridges will be ballistically matched to the tactical cartridges, allowing the Warfighter to train in a cost effective manner. This project will leverage earlier efforts in support of the United States Army Europe (USAREUR) Operational Needs Statement (ONS) #15-20590 Stryker Increased Lethality for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (2CR).  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support the continuation of Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for all cartridges.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>30X173mm APFSDS-T and TPDS-T: Proposals were requested from Industry to develop a 30x173mm APFSDS-T anti-materiel tactical cartridge (XM1170) and a 30x173mm TPDS-T anti-materiel training cartridge (XM1172) that will meet Army Performance Specifications and Stryker Lethality Annex Requirements. Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through two DOTC contracts were awarded to contractors to support development, DET and DT&amp;E in support of Milestone C. The Government will award Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)- based contracts for production of each cartridge.

30x173mm HEAB-T and TP-T: In support of the 30mm Multi-Function Munition Capability Development Document (CDD), the 30x173mm HEAB-T cartridge (XM1182) and the ballistically matched TP-T cartridge (XM1173) will be developed to meet the requirements. The Government anticipates awarding two contracts utilizing an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) through DOTC to support development, DET and DT&amp;E in support of Milestone C. The Government will down-select and award a single FAR-based contract for production.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The C-DAEM Project will provide United States (U.S.) ground forces with the capability to engage area personnel through armored targets, while denying threat forces full operational freedom within the targeted area.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was completed in January 2018 to inform Army acquisition and investment decisions regarding replacement of the current stockpile of 155 millimeter (mm) Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) with Department of Defense (DoD) policy compliant munitions and address anti-armor and extended range capability requirements.  The Army validated two materiel solutions for C-DAEM to be pursued in parallel.  C-DAEM Armor (Increment 1) will destroy moved and moving infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and tanks.  C-DAEM DPICM Replacement (Increment 2) will destroy personnel to light-skinned vehicles.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding will support qualification of C-DAEM DPICM Replacement solution(s) for safety, performance, and DoD policy compliance verification testing to support the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

A Procurement of Ammunition, Army (PAA) funding line for C-DAEM DPICM Replacement, Standard Serial Number (SSN) E68604, PROJ, ARTY, 155MM C-DAEM INCREMENT 2, will be established in FY 2024 for this effort.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>C-DAEM will employ an evolutionary acquisition approach to efficiently transition the unique ammunition products as they become available.  The AoA completed on 31 January 2018 qualified a dramatic enhancement of operational Fires effectiveness, efficiency, and maneuver support when cannon artillery was equipped with a dedicated extended range, anti-armor projectile.  In FY 2021, C-DAEM will utilize Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) initiatives for DPICM Replacement in support of hardware qualification testing.  The U.S. Government will lead EMD efforts to complete qualification and meet Milestone C requirements by 4th Quarter (Q) FY 2024.  C-DAEM DPICM Replacement will transition to a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based production contract after Milestone C for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Small Caliber Ammo for Next Gen Squad Weapons project is a critical technology development in response to the Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team (SL CFT) Initial Capability Document (ICD) for the ammunition required to support the rapid prototyping, development, and fielding of the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) under the Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) authority for rapid prototyping/rapid fielding. The objective is to develop and Full Materiel Release (FMR) the new ammunition in parallel with the NGSW rifle and automatic rifle. The NGSW ammunition is split into two initial projectile variants, the General Purpose (GP) and the Special Purpose (SP). Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding supports continuing rapid prototyping/development of the GP projectile, building prototypes and delivering prototypes to the weapon system contractors for integration into the weapon system development, conducting prototype testing and engineering testing. FY 2021 also supports continuing rapid prototyping for the SP projectile, conducting a Critical Design Review (CDR), conducting prototype testing and engineering testing. FY 2021 supports development of prototype solutions for the Reduced Range Ammunition (RRA) variant; to include building and evaluating RRA concepts/designs, and conducting a Preliminary Design Review (PDR). FY 2021 also includes development efforts to evaluate competing concepts/solutions for the tracer ammunition variant required for the NGSW; including maturing/refining tracer ammunition designs and performing engineering tests. FY 2021 supports initial activities to evaluate potential solutions/prototypes and concepts to satisfy follow-on NGSW ammunition requirements. Follow-on NGSW ammunition types includes: Blank and Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) training ammunition. Development efforts on the follow-on NGSW ammunition variants will continue into FY 2022. This is a priority of the Secretary's Close Combat Lethality Task Force. Funding for this project aligns with the Army's priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) M1156 is a course correcting fuze that provides precision accuracy and efficiency for current and future 155 millimeter (mm) High Explosive (HE) projectiles by eliminating a portion of the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions, which effectively reduces the number of projectiles required to execute fire missions.  PGK utilizes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and internal Guidance and Navigation Computer to accomplish its mission with point detonating and height of burst fuzing functions.  The PGK M1156E1 development effort, Long Range-PGK (LR-PGK), will qualify state of the art technologies for operation in GPS degraded environments and compatibility with Army Modernization objectives under the Long Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team's (LRPF CFT) new long range cannon, Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA).  The ERCA and its new long range projectiles require the LR-PGK to meet lethality requirements, and will be fielded during the PGK Life Cycle.  LR-PGK supports the Army's modernization priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy and future 155mm projectiles and M777 Long Range Cannon (LRC) initiatives.  Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 funding supports the award of a follow-on Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for system design and prototype development for LR-PGK.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>Procurement of Ammunition, Army (PAA) funding for M1156 (NA36) through FY 2023 with transition to LR-PGK M1156E1 (NZ04) in FY 2024.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The PGK is a GPS guidance kit with fuzing functions for 155mm HE artillery projectiles.  PGK provides precision accuracy and effectiveness for 155mm HE projectiles.  The PGK corrects the inherent errors associated with ballistic firing solutions and reduces the number of artillery projectiles required to execute the mission.  The current PGK Increment has been qualified for the M795 and M549A1 HE projectiles.  This increment of PGK entered Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) at Milestone C in March 2013.  Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) was completed in FY 2015, Full Material Release (FMR) was approved in FY 2016, Full Rate Production (FRP) decision and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) occurred FY 2016.  Follow-on LR-PGK development efforts are focused on addressing performance in GPS degraded environments as well as ensuring compatibility with the Army's new long range 155mm cannon and projectiles, which are scheduled to be fielded in the same timeframe as the new increment of PGK.  The contracting strategy includes competitive DoD Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) concept development efforts with multiple contractors in FY 2017, followed by a DOTC Risk Reduction concept maturation phase in FY 2018 through FY 2019.  Down-select to one system contractor and EMD DOTC contract award will occur in FY 2020.  Demonstration efforts to support Milestone C will continue through 2023.  The Program will transition to a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) based production contract after Milestone C for LRIP in FY 2024 and FRP in FY 2025.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectNote>This is a new start in FY2021.

Project XT2 40 millimeter (mm) Door Breach (DB) is a new start in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.</r2:ProjectNote>
                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The 40mm Low Velocity (LV) Door Breach (DB), XM1167, cartridge allows the grenadier to conduct a ballistic breach of an existing door to create an entry point into a building or other structure. This capability is critical during Urban Operations, while having stand-off ability to conduct ballistic breach at ranges up to 50 meters away, with a single-shot, and without pause between actual breach and entry of initial force. The 40mm DB cartridge will provide the small unit with the capability to conduct efficient breaching operations; allowing the Warfighter to create an entry point into a structure for an assault element to enter and begin clearing operations, one of the most difficult types of operations that Soldiers may face in an urban environment. The 40mm DB cartridge will reduce collateral damage and friendly casualties associated with breaching operations.  The deployment of 40mm DB cartridges will enable the small unit to gain and maintain a tactical advantage through efficiency of combat power and momentum. FY 2021 will consist of Developmental Testing and Evaluation (DT&amp;E) efforts for the purpose of qualifying the Door Breach cartridge design.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The DB cartridge development consists of characterization testing of multiple designs provided by industry which will be used to further inform a future down-select to a single design that will be taken through DT&amp;E. Following DT&amp;E, the program will proceed to Milestone C. After Milestone C, the program will enter into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and conduct Final Hazard Classification (FHC) testing. The program will use the results of DT&amp;E, LRIP and FHC testing to achieve Type Classification and Full Materiel Release in FY 2023.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post. This line develops the capabilities to improve power generation and distribution within the Army Command Posts which in turn reduces Command Post sustainment requirements.

This project supports the Tactical Electric Power (TEP) programs (2kW-800kW Generators and Associated Equip) which is established to develop a modernized, standard family of Mobile Electric Power (MEP) systems to include MEP Generating Sources (MEPGS), and MEP Distribution Systems (MEPDS), MEP Storage Systems (MEPSS) and MEP Management Systems (MEPMS) for all Services throughout the Department of Defense IAW DoDI 4120.11. Building on the device/component evaluations conducted in PE 0603804A project G11, this project supports the system development and demonstration of a series of innovative mobile electric power systems that are essential to the development and eventual fielding of modernized MEPGS, MEPMS, MEPSS and MEPDS. This project also supports Army modernization priorities, specifically Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in Network / Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence (C3I), Soldier Lethality, Air/ Missile Defense and Precision Fires and reduces sustainment requirements. 

PDISE provides reliable, modular design power distribution equipment that is critical to deploying power networks. PDISE will add power distribution > 60kW.  The equipment developed will provide an interface for future Onboard Vehicle Power system and Hybrid power systems. 

FY 2021 funds will support the Prime Power Distribution System (PPDS) testing and development and STEP Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP) program is a modernization program that will provide a family of systems of improved mobile Tactical Electric Power (TEP) sources and will replace the legacy 2 kilowatt (kW) Military Tactical Generator (MTG) and the 3kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG).  STEP models will be lightweight, modular, reliable, and more logistically supportable power sources than their predecessors for the Department of Defense's (DoD) 21st Century digitized forces.  The acquisition for STEP will incorporate Joint service requirements to reduce cost, maximize interoperability and increase performance over existing generator systems.  STEP will implement 3 separate lines of effort.  Lightweight Tactical Power Source (TPS) will conduct an effort to incentivize the industry and foster competition for small power generator.  The intent is to streamline the development phase and to determine the entry point into the acquisition lifecycle.  Pending the result of the effort, two of the three systems (Lightweight Tactical Power Source (TPS) and Hybrid Augmentation System (HAS)) will start the development phase in FY 2021.  This will include systems integration, prototyping, Soldier evaluations, limited testing and systems demonstration to deliver a design to meet all performance requirements and to provide the technical, logistics documentation to support STEP under the Army's two level maintenance concept.  As these two Lines of Effort (LOE) end development phase in FY23, the 3kW hardened TPS effort will start development following a similar acquisition approach to the first two LOEs.


The Power Distribution Illumination Systems Electrical (PDISE) program will use a multi-phase acquisition strategy, continue to consolidate requirements and provide solutions to known power distribution capability gaps. The effort will include PDISE Medium, the current Army power distribution equipment (PDISE) and the microgrid feeder box; PDISE - Large, the multi-input Power Distribution Unit (PDU) being developed for use with large tactical electric power generators and PDISE Prime, the Prime Power Connection Kit (PPCK) and other products to provide the full range of power distribution equipment to support present and future power system requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

This project develops the tools and processes that will optimize recommendations for the materiel used to establish, operate, and maintain contingency bases. The project will increase the available knowledge at the base level and provide an analytical foundation for sound investment decision making. The continuous improvement modeling and simulation analysis tools will match the evolution of threats and technologies. Using a system of systems engineering approach, the Contingency Base Infrastructure (CBI) Product Directorate's focus ensures optimum integration of materiel across the base camp to facilitate the maximizing of Warfighter effectiveness.  CBI's analytical results will allow leadership to make data driven, informed decisions on the acquisition and employment/deployment of equipment. This enables contingency bases to be established, operated and managed as a system (system of systems) and the equipment acquired for the base to be compatible and efficient while providing the maximum overall support to the Warfighter. This approach supports Program(s) of Record (PORs) to maximize improvements in Operational Energy and ensures efficiencies across all Areas of Responsibility (AOR).</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Army's new Maneuver Support Vessels (MSVs) support Dynamic Force Repositioning (DFR) and provides the Combatant and Multi-Domain Task Force Commander with organic waterborne lift capability that can deliver today's Army maneuver platforms and equipment, and supply bulk fuel and water across the full spectrum of operations with increased speed and lower draft; and mitigates anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threat by providing access to shallow coastal waters, rivers, in narrow inland waterways in support of dispersed force elements in austere environments and where mature ports or road networks are unavailable.  The MSVs are critical modernization efforts in support of the Army's Watercraft Transformation Strategy (AWTS) and Army Force Package 2.0. 

The Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) - MSV(L) is the first modernization program which will displace the Army's aging Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8) class of vessels.  The LCM-8 does not have the speed, functional draft (shallow water capability), and maneuver capability to move today's Army Maneuver Platforms. 

The MSV-L provides upgraded capabilities such as higher operational speed, reduced draft and increased payload to conduct maneuver support missions including delivery of the Army's maneuver platforms such as a combat configured Abrams, Stryker and Bradley Fighting Vehicles along with critical sustainment missions including delivery of food, water, fuel, and ammunition.  The MSV(L) program is currently in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).  Specifically, FY 2021 funds the production of the single full scale MSV(L) prototype, contractor and government testing of the prototype and support for milestone documentation for Milestone C approval.

The Maneuver Support Vessel (Next) - MSV(N) is the second modernization program in the AWTS.  In FY 2021, the Army is initiating feasibility studies to determine if the Army can replace both the aging Logistics Support Vessel (LSV) and the Landing Craft Utility (LCU) class of vessels with one common vessel class.  Although the LSV and LCU vessels are the Army's Watercraft highest operational vessel classes, the Army must also evolve to meet the needs of the future Multi-Domain Task Force and Combatant Command missions.  Specifically, FY 2021 funds the start of the MSV(N) market research, affordability and feasibility studies to inform future watercraft modernization requirements and an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA).

In general, all Army Watercraft funding supports initiatives to enhance the seaworthiness, safety, and survivability while increasing the lethality, tactical mobility, and operational capability of the Army Mariner to preserve the Combatant Commanders requirement of "freedom of seas" access in all areas of the world particularly the littorals, to support maneuver operations in all Areas of Responsibility.

In FY 2021, $0.178 million in Reimbursable Manpower for this line has been realigned from Reimbursable Civilian Funding to Direct Operations and Maintenance. Program support costs have been accurately updated to reflect the realignments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>ULCANS provides increased survivability against multi-spectral visual, infrared and radar threats, thermal signature suppression and significant thermal/solar reduction capability. ULCANS is capable of use in all types of weather and climatic conditions except in heavy snow and winds.  ULCANS variants are integrated systems that are very lightweight, easily deployable, versatile, user friendly and tailored to the equipment meeting the requirements of operations for combat systems, command and control equipment, logistic support sites, tactical facilities, and fixed facilities. RDT&amp;E funding for ULCANS Increment I program supports formal development for necessary technology/signature enhancements of three ULCANS Increment I variants (Woodland, Arctic, Desert/Urban) to replace current legacy ULCANS variants (Woodland and Desert).

Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) provides Full Spectrum Signature Management for Vehicles from ground, aerial, and satellite. MCS enables combat vehicle protection and survivability against current peer and near-peer threats; defeats enemy targeting and surveillance systems through multi-spectral concealment (UV, VIS, NIR, SWIR, Thermal, Radar); enables multi-domain operations in A2/AD environment and provides operational units layered protection and concealment against long-range precision fires, drones, ground, aerial, and satellite threats.

Funding supports modernization of current camouflage net systems by investigating technology insertions that decrease Soldier and platform detection from threat sensors.  Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of operational requirements and early user feedback to maintain overmatch signature reduction against future threat sensors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports the engineering, manufacturing, and development of combat engineer equipment used in support of horizontal and vertical engineer construction missions, and to develop a variety of enabling systems that will support and improve mobility for Engineers in the Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Combat Support Brigade (CSB), and Multi-Roll Bridge Company (MRBC) forces. This project also supports the development of enabling systems to meet critical capabilities of joint interdependence through Air and Ground Line of Communication and Rapid Tactical Earthmoving repair and construction which increase the operational reach of modular forces. Systems that support BCT and CSB forces include: High Mobility Engineer Excavators, Scrapers, Scoop Loaders, Skid Steer Loaders, Dozers, Cranes (ATEC and Family of All Terrain Cranes), Graders and Engineer Rapid Airfield Construction Capability (ERACC).  Systems that support the MRBC included the Hydraulic Excavators (HYEX), Dozer, High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE), and The All Terrain Crane.

This project also supports the effort for Construction Equipment Virtual Trainers (CEVTs) first article of each variant. The CEVTs are commercial off the shelf virtual training devices with software modifications for military unique tasks.  These simulators enable the United States Army Engineer School with the capability to more effectively train Engineer Military Occupational Skill (MOS), while reducing maintenance of actual equipment and fuel costs during traditional training.  These simulators provide the Engineer Warfighter with a multitude of training scenarios and continuous hands on training on a variety of construction equipment and in various simulated conditions.  Use of CEVT increases skills and competency in the operation of equipment.The funding will be to perform integration, software development, contractor testing, contractor data gathering, and development of prototypes.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>These systems provide state-of-the-art deployable, combat engineer and construction equipment and critical life support along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment supporting the joint warfighter.  These programs enhance combat and military operations minimize transportation requirements and reduce the logistical footprint by eliminating obsolete equipment and reducing the number of programs. The Combat Engineer and Construction equipment consists of the Surveying, Firefighting Individual Requirements Equipment Support (FIRES), Fire Protection Equipment Type I, II and III, Tactical Fire Fighting Truck Tools (TFTT), Family of Power Utility Kits (FoPUK), and Soldier Portable Kits, Lineman's Tool Kit, Concrete and Masonry, Electricians, Plumbers, Pipefitters, Family of Light Sets (FoLS), Airfield Damage Repair Kit (ADRK), Diving Equipment, Surface Swimmer Support Sets, Surface Supplied Diving Set, procurement of new Technical/Special Tools, Pioneer Support Set, and the Pioneer Land Clearing and Building Erection Set. Project will explore Additive Manufacturing for Engineer systems. Funding will support the procurement of market samples and testing for Soldier Portable Sets, Kits, and Outfits (SKO), Special Tools initiative, and critical life support equipment such as the Deep Sea Set, Underwater Construction Set, Photo Support Set, Diver Supplemental Issue Set, Closed Circuit Scuba Set, Supervisor Propulsion Emergency and Recovery SCUBA (SPEaRS), Divers' Supplemental Issue Set(DSIS), Vertical Skills Engineer Construction Kit (VSECK), and Family of Boats and Motors (FOBAM).

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: This project supports development, demonstration, testing and evaluation within the Combat Engineer and Construction Support Equipment arena. These items include critical life support equipment such as diving, firefighting, fire suppression, urban and dense urban operations, subterranean operations, breathable air compressors, and emergency and recovery sets along with engineer safety and special unit support equipment and photo support sets. Funding shall allow for development of dual use systems that support wartime use by Soldiers to include Special Forces and peacetime operations that include national disaster relief and homeland security operations.  Much of this equipment has an inherent short Economic Useful Life (EUL). Investments used to revise, update and obtain equipment within this portfolio has resulted in increased readiness, safety, and effectiveness and reductions in footprint.

Funding supports modernization of the current Ordnance/Engineer equipment by investigating technology insertions due to but not limited to obsolescence and technology innovations. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement operating concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mobile Maintenance Equipment provides state of the art, deployable, vehicle-mounted, Soldier portable and containerized shelter tool systems supporting the readiness of the Joint warfighter directly supporting Soldier Lethality, Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) and Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF), as well as, addressing GAPs 10 and 17. These systems are equipped with industrial quality tools required for Two Level Maintenance that reduce common tool redundancy, provide tool standardization, minimize transportation requirements, reduce logistical footprint, and are backed by a Lifetime Warranty/Replacement Program which reduces sustainment costs. This is accomplished by employing a system of systems approach to maintenance acquisition. The System of Systems approach builds a maintenance capability upon each system, allowing a logical and natural approach to the Army's overall two level maintenance strategy. These inter-connected systems distributed throughout the Army at multiple levels and echelons provide a holistic repair capability in all scenarios and environments. These systems provide the Maintenance and Combat Commanders an unprecedented capability to repair wheeled, tracked, aviation, ground support and weapons systems on site at one location at one time. This approach to maintenance acquisition increases efficiencies and supports the current force while providing modular configurations designed to meet the specific needs of the Army maintainer in today's complex transforming environment. 

BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION:  The need to develop and maintain a System of System maintenance approach is critical for maintaining readiness due to the growing complexity of today's military equipment, operational tempo, modularity, and current and evolving Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The individual maintenance systems are comprehensive, interconnected and capable of solving and repairing any maintenance problems. The System of Systems approach does not advocate specific tools, methods or practices; instead it seeks to promote a streamlined comprehensive set of systems for solving maintenance challenges where the interactions of doctrine, technology, time and tactics techniques and procedures are the primary drivers.  Funding for projects shall include test article procurement and testing of Soldier portable maintenance Sets, Kits, and Outfits (SKOs), load banks and refrigeration tool kit; investigation of new technologies for next generation mobile maintenance equipment shop sets including the Shop Equipment Welding (SEW) and Shop Equipment Contact Maintenance (SECM); development of additional Standard Automotive Tool Set (SATS) maintenance modules, Armament Repair Shop Set (ARSS), Mobile Ammunition Processing Facility (MAPF), Forward Repair System (FRS), Special Tools initiatives, shelter mounted system development; packaging development; and technical support for emerging Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) materiel requirements documents. Additive Manufacturing increased capabilities to the Metal Working and Machining Shop Set (MWMSS) to include a polymer and metal printing and associated digital library capability. Modernization upgrades increase effectiveness while improving efficiency, reliability and maintainability while supporting emerging Army systems as well as using lower cost set components.

Funding supports modernization of the current Ordnance equipment by investigating technology insertions due to but not limited to obsolescence and technology innovations. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of Operational Requirements and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational movement concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort #4, Command Post.  Program develops/integrates IECUs supporting current and new requirements such as the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), a family of Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS), and other emerging requirements. In addition, supports critical Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) modifications required to support the Chemically Protected Deployable Medical System (CP DEPMEDS).  

The Improved Environmental Control Units (IECU) program will provide updates that support the new generation of Environmental Control Units (ECUs) that use environmentally approved refrigerants, with zero Ozone-Depleting Chemicals (ODCs) and low Global Warming potential refrigerants to replace the current Military Standard (MIL-STD) Family of ECUs. The IECUs will provide improved cooling, heating and dehumidification to Soldiers and critical equipment systems in combat, combat support, combat service support units, and combat support hospitals. The IECUs are required to replace currently fielded ECUs in order to comply with statutory and regulatory restrictions on the use of Class II ODCs (such as HCFC-22) and to improve the performance of military ECUs. They are form, fit, and function replacements to the current MIL-STD ECUs. Technical improvements over existing ECUs will yield significant fuel and weight savings, reduction in scheduled maintenance and increased reliability. The new family of IECUs utilizes a new refrigerant which complies with mandated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Funding supports the development of application specific variants, shelter system integration, as well as supporting the new ECU requirements coming from the Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) and Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS) Capabilities Development Documents (CDD). In addition, the field has identified an emerging requirement for cooling at intermediate capacities. These variants will further standardize cooling units in the field, enable cooling of larger shelters and structures, offer increased mobility, and may be used to cool multiple tents with one unit. Funding also supports developing initial prototypes to enable refinement of operational requirement and early user feedback to support future sustainment and operational energy concepts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of critical soldier support and sustainment systems that provide more endurance and agility to combat operations enabling success of Army Expeditionary Forces in future multi-domain scenarios.  Project includes highly mobile shelter systems (rigid and soft wall), expeditionary base camp subsystems, field service systems, mortuary affairs equipment, field heaters, and other combat service support equipment. These systems will fill identified theater capability gaps, improve safety, improve unit sustainability, improve resource and energy efficiency and increase combat effectiveness.  This project supports Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Prototyping, and testing of critical tactical support systems that support mobile Joint Service command and control, medical, force projection and maintenance platforms. This project develops critical enablers that support the Army Campaign Plan and Army Modernization Strategy by maintaining readiness through fielding and integrating new equipment.  This project also ensures Army Expeditionary Forces are capable of rapid deployment while reducing sustainment requirements, related Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) demands in lift, combat zone footprint, and costs for logistical support.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                <r2:Description>Develops an add-on ice making capability that automatically dispenses and seals 10 pound bags at a rate of a minimum of 3,600 pounds of ice per day. This capability is based upon current Army operational requirements for ice which is four pounds per Soldier per day. This capability enables support for up to 900 personnel. Current operations require external support to provide personnel with ice for cooling drinking water in extremely arid environments. This capability will reduce the sustainment risk and cost associated with transporting this commodity from external sources. The objective requirement enables stockage of ice to assist with surge operations.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:Title>Army Standard Family of Rigid Wall Shelters (ASF-RWS)</r2:Title>
                                <r2:Description>The ASF-RWS program will conduct formal development to incorporate the latest technologies into a fully supportable and modernized family. The intent is to eliminate the proliferation of non-standard shelters and their associated logistics burden, thereby reducing the lifecycle cost of RWS across the Services. The program will produce approved Technical Data Packages (TDPs) to support procurements by materiel developers and Program Managers (PMs) requiring RWS. Once developed and formally type-classified, ASF-RWS procurements are customer funded by PMs as a cost under their program(s). The ASF-RWS will consist of three variants: (1) Expandable/Non-Expandable; (2) Vehicle Mounted; and (3) Panelized/Collapsible with a focus on the following features and improvements: reduced cost, reduced weight, improved energy efficiency, improved corrosion resistance, and improved transportability.</r2:Description>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2, Common Operating Environment. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

JBC-P supports the LOE 2 by utilizing:
- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms
- Integration with Joint C5ISR and strike capabilities
- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains

The Joint Battle Command - Platform program is the cornerstone of Joint Forces Command and Control (C2) Situational Awareness (SA) and communications. JBC-P includes a network which enables the movement of data and provides secure Blue Force Tracking (BFT) capability in Platforms and Command Posts, providing soldiers and commanders a map-based Common Operating Picture of the battlefield, as a result, reducing fratricide.

PdM JBC-P, under PM Mission Command (MC), is collaborating with the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) on evolving the BFT network. Systems engineering/planning activities are underway to develop the evolution path of the BFT network, and the introduction of a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). In addition, there were two RDT&amp;E contractual efforts in FY18 (assess the feasibility of reusing existing BFT-2 transceivers (hardware) and replacing it third party or government owned waveforms), and FY 2019 (assess the feasibility of introducing BFT network resiliency components to existing BFT network). Those efforts are intended to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry in FY 2021.  

JBC-P RDT&amp;E resources are used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance, and network resiliency; while Mounted Computer Environment (MCE) RDT&amp;E is used to improve and add software applications.

FY 2021 funding has been increased to allow JBC-P to perform initial modular waveform audit and validation, prototype BFT-3 transceiver performance testing, and release of transceiver contract solicitation.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The JBC-P Capabilities Development Document in lieu of Capabilities Production Document (CDD ILO CPD) was Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved March 2013. Completed Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) as part of Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 in 3QFY13. The IOT&amp;E tested the JBC-P system software on existing FBCB2 hardware (non-dismountable vehicle systems) and future production-representative hardware. On completion of Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) and Joint Interoperability Test Certification (JITC), MDA authorized Full Rate Production (FRP) in 1QFY14. First unit equipped (FUE) was successfully conducted 3QFY15.

Developmental efforts are being performed through intra-government collaboration. System engineering efforts are being performed by C5ISR's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD); Command, Power and Integration (CP&amp;I) and the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD). Those efforts are intended to inform a BFT-3 full and open solicitation (RFP) to industry FY21.  Hardware along with fielding, training and field support efforts are obtained through existing competitively awarded contracts.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) funds advanced development of medical materiel within the System Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production portions of the acquisition life cycle using 6.5 (System Development and Demonstration) funding. It supports products successfully developed in the Systems Integration portion of the Systems Development and Demonstration phases through completion of the Milestone C Decision Review. Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) medical products are also tested and evaluated for military use, when available. This PE primarily includes pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials necessary for licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

Projects in this PE include the following:

Project 812 funds military relevant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medical countermeasures. These funds provide for engineering and manufacturing development of candidate vaccines and drugs to permit large-scale field testing. Development focused on military unique needs effecting manning, mobilization, and deployment. Products from this project will normally transition to Department of Defense (DoD) Health Programs or Other Procurement, Army (OPA) Funds.

Project 832 funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Mature COTS medical products are also evaluated for military use. Consideration will also be given to reduce the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. Products from this project will normally transition to OPA Funds. 

Project 849 funds development of candidate medical countermeasures for military relevant infectious diseases. These products fall in four major areas: vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices, and insect control measures to limit exposure and disease transmission. FDA approval is a mandatory obligation for all military products placed into the hands of medical providers or service members for human use. Products from this project will normally transition to DoD Health Programs or OPA funds. 

These Projects are managed by United States (U.S.) Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) and U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds the engineering and manufacturing development of medical products for enhanced combat casualty care and follow-on care, including rehabilitation. Mature COTS medical products are also evaluated for military use. Specifically funds pivotal (conclusive) human clinical trials or mechanical engineering evaluations for effectiveness of devices or biologics (products derived from living organisms) to fulfill unique military requirements. Consideration is also given to reducing the medical sustainment footprint through smaller weight and cube volume, or equipment independence from supporting materiel. This work is frequently completed through a laboratory/contractor team with the contractor obtaining the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for sale of the product.

Major contractors/intra-governmental agencies include: IGR Enterprises, Inc.; Army Medical Department Board Test Center; Se Qual Technologies, Inc.; Enginivity, Inc.; Ultrasound Diagnostician; HemCon Medical Technologies; Cerdak Ltd; Hemerus Medical, LLC; Fast Track Drugs &amp; Biologics, LLC; Integrated Medical Systems, Inc.; the National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI); and the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) and Institute of Surgical Research (ISR) for user evaluation. Other military agencies include Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, PEO Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS &amp; CSS), and Naval Undersea Warfare Center.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This Project funds development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCM: e.g., vaccines, drugs, diagnostic kits/devices) for militarily relevant infectious diseases. This also funds methods to determine if insects are infected with pathogenic organisms thereby posing a risk to service members' and control insect exposure/prevent Warfighters form being bitten by those insects. It funds research that supports conclusive human clinical trials to demonstrate MCM effectiveness safety and related manufacturing tests. This work, which is jointly performed by military laboratories, civilian contracted pharmaceutical firms and foreign research partners, is directed toward the prevention of disease, early diagnosis, and speeding recovery once diagnosed. Medical products approved for human use must meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before MCM can be used on Warfighters. Development priority is based upon four major factors: (1) the extent of the disease within the Combatant Commands' theater of operations, (2) the clinical severity of the disease, (3) the technical maturity of the proposed solution, and (4) the affordability of the solution (development, production, and sustainment). Malaria, dysentery, hepatitis, and Dengue diseases (a severe debilitating disease transmitted by mosquitoes), which are found in all Combatant Command areas and are at the top of the infectious diseases risks list.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This Program Element (PE) provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of networked munitions, countermine systems, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) render safe, and counter improvised explosive device capabilities. This PE also implements the National Landmine Policy to develop alternatives to the non-self-destructing counter mobility anti-personnel landmine systems. The PE contributes to area access and area denial (A2/AD) to support unified land operations and improve soldier survivability.

Project 016:  Funding in this program supports the Army's Cross Functional Teams (CFT) initiatives.  Project 016, Close Combat Capabilities, covers two programs: Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Render Safe (EOD RS). It provides for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and demonstration of capabilities needed for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams to Render Safe (RS) US and foreign ordnance and improvised explosive devices, enabling ground force commanders to retain freedom of maneuver and secure lines of communications.  NGABS directly contributes to Soldier lethality and ground force commander freedom of maneuver by providing next generation sensor and optics in the cutting-edge Heads-Up-Display (HUD) while integrating the Government's latest investments in protective material for the modular, scalable NGABS bomb suit fabrication.  EOD RS equips EOD teams with low light visual augmentation system, electronic countermeasures, buried IED detection, dismounted X-ray imager, X-ray generator, trace explosive, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN), and drug detection, unmanned aerial system, power management, gamma and neutron search and detection, and render safe initiation.  This project will continue to support cross-service initiatives to improve commonality.

NGABS will increase the Warfighter lethality and mobility by optimizing Soldier protection for EOD personnel, while effectively managing all life cycle aspects of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Warfighter lethality is increased through bomb suit weight reduction utilizing extensive investments in protective material research and development.  The result is material solutions that are lighter and are pieced together in a manner which increases Soldier mobility and longevity.  EOD Soldier situational awareness and exposure to ballistic threats is enhanced through the NGABS HUD which allows the Soldier increased visibility under various obscurants and low/no-light situations.

Project 415:  This Project provides for Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for the next generation of capabilities to detect, identify and neutralize hybrid threats and explosive hazards such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and landmines.  These capabilities are a Family of Systems (FOS) encompassing handheld, vehicle mounted, small robotic mounted, aerial platform mounted and area access, and neutralization systems operating in manned, remotely controlled, semi-autonomous or fully autonomous modes.  Continued development of this FOS is necessary to support Route Clearance Platoons located within both Engineer Companies and Brigade Engineering Battalion Brigade Combat Teams.

The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) is a counter-explosive device capability that provides standoff detection and marking of metallic encased caches and metallic and low-metallic antitank landmines, unexploded ordnance, trigger mechanisms, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of route and area-clearance operations. HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on the Husky route clearance vehicle. The program was restructured in September 2016 to align with emerging shallow buried Wire Detection (WD) capabilities integrated onto the HMDS Increment A1 configuration (includes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). These changes are necessary to adapt to changing IED threats. WD Technology will be fully integrated through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) at the end of FY20. Prototypes developed under the concluded HMDS Increment A2 effort may be leveraged in development of future capabilities. Future capabilities may include detection of deep buried IEDs and caches, and semi-autonomous control of the Husky vehicle and HMDS from inside a follow-on vehicle. 

Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type I consists of a semi-autonomous vehicle and includes designated control vehicles and Operator Control Units (OCUs) which provide a standoff capability to detect and neutralize the full spectrum of explosive hazards. Type I integrates a semi-autonomous kit onto a High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) for remote control from a Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV). RCIS Type I semi-autonomous kit will be integrated onto the HMEE and be capable of interrogating and classifying explosive hazards. An OCU will be integrated into a Buffalo MPCV for Type I. RCIS capabilities will be fielded to Route Clearance Squads and Engineer Platoons which includes Tele-operation, RADAR-based Follow-Me, LIDAR obstacle detection, onscreen predictive turning map, and customizable camera views in order to achieve the RCIS mission.  

Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), provides increased survivability through mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier.  It provides area access and freedom of movement for the Commander.  SREHD consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles.  The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards.  This capability allows a soldier to remain in a protective posture while detecting and neutralizing a wide variety of hybrid and conventional explosive threats.  SREHD conducted a successful Milestone (MS) C in April 2018 and initiated Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in June 2018.  Due to the realignment of funds FY 2020-2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed.  The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.

Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (REHDS) provides the warfighter with a robotic mounted capability to detect and mark buried landmines and IEDs from a safe standoff distance.  REHDS is an enabler for Soldier Lethality as it enables soldier maneuverability by enhancing the probability and speed of detection of buried landmines and IEDs allowing for increased speed of dismounted operations making the unit more efficient and lethal.  REHDS is a new start in FY 2021 and begins in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  REHDS will leverage developed SREHD capability and incorporate increased Rate of Advanced Downtrack (RoAD) and Integration to the Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) II platform. FY 2021 Total Base funding in the amount of $1.998 million supports EMD activities with REHDS.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) Program utilizes a competitive, developmental, innovative and efficient Other Transaction Authority (OTA) in EMD through the Fort Belvoir Sensor Communication and Electronic Consortium (SCEC) which will result in a production ready prototype leading to a competitive Production and Deployment (PD) phase for full capability while ensuring best value to the Army. Milestone (MS) B / Material Development Decision (MDD) occurred in FY 2018 and MS C is scheduled for FY 2022.

The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Render Safe (RS) program utilizes existing government contract vehicles to acquire prototype systems for testing and evaluation of the systems for down selection and inclusion in the capabilities package during Engineering and Manufacturing Development.  The program will continue to use the existing government contract vehicles for the production and deployment phase as well as to continue the development of capabilities during the 5 phase technical refresh.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project 415:  This Project provides for Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) for the next generation of capabilities to detect, identify and neutralize hybrid threats and explosive hazards such as Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and landmines.  These capabilities are a Family of Systems (FOS) encompassing handheld, vehicle mounted, small robotic mounted, aerial platform mounted and area access, and neutralization systems operating in manned, remotely controlled, semi-autonomous or fully autonomous modes.  Continued development of this FOS is necessary to support Route Clearance Platoons located within both Engineer Companies and Brigade Engineering Battalion Brigade Combat Teams.

The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) is a counter-explosive device capability that provides standoff detection and marking of metallic encased caches and metallic and low-metallic antitank landmines, unexploded ordnance, trigger mechanisms, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in support of route and area-clearance operations. HMDS is a mission equipment package mounted on the Husky route clearance vehicle. The program was restructured in September 2016 to align with emerging shallow buried Wire Detection (WD) capabilities integrated onto the HMDS Increment A1 configuration (includes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). These changes are necessary to adapt to changing IED threats. WD Technology will be fully integrated through Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) at the end of FY20. Prototypes developed under the concluded HMDS Increment A2 effort may be leveraged in development of future capabilities. Future capabilities may include detection of deep buried IEDs and caches, and semi-autonomous control of the Husky vehicle and HMDS from inside a follow-on vehicle. 

Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) Type I consists of a semi-autonomous vehicle and includes designated control vehicles and Operator Control Units (OCUs) which provide a standoff capability to detect and neutralize the full spectrum of explosive hazards. Type I integrates a semi-autonomous kit onto a High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) for remote control from a Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV). RCIS Type I semi-autonomous kit will be integrated onto the HMEE and be capable of interrogating and classifying explosive hazards. An OCU will be integrated into a Buffalo MPCV for Type I. RCIS capabilities will be fielded to Route Clearance Squads and Engineer Platoons which includes Tele-operation, RADAR-based Follow-Me, LIDAR obstacle detection, onscreen predictive turning map, and customizable camera views in order to achieve the RCIS mission.  

Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD), formerly known as the Autonomous Mine Detection System (AMDS), provides increased survivability through mine and explosive hazards stand-off detection, marking and neutralization capability for the dismounted soldier. It provides area access and freedom of movement for the Commander. SREHD consists of payload modules to be mounted on man-portable unmanned ground vehicles. The payloads are for surface laid and buried threats to include mines and explosive hazards. This capability allows a soldier to remain in a protective posture while detecting and neutralizing a wide variety of hybrid and conventional explosive threats. SREHD conducted a successful Milestone (MS) C in April 2018 and initiated Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) in June 2018. Due to the realignment of funds from FY 2020 through FY 2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed. The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.

Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (REHDS) provides the warfighter with a robotic mounted capability to detect and mark buried landmines and IEDs from a safe standoff distance. REHDS is an enabler for Soldier Lethality as it guarantees soldier maneuverability by enhancing the probability and speed of detection of buried landmines and IEDs allowing for increased speed of dismounted operations making the unit more efficient and lethal. REHDS is a new start in FY 2021 and begins in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. REHDS will leverage developed SREHD capability and incorporate increased Rate of Advanced Downtrack (RoAD) and Integration to the Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) II platform.  FY 2021 Total Base funding in the amount of $1.998 million supports EMD activities for REHDS.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) program is pursuing an acquisition approach that delivers capability increments - Increment A, Configuration 1 (A1) to the Warfighter by leveraging the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) currently deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). In FY 2020, the program will complete execution of an Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) to add a wire detection capability to address evolving threat, and Infrared illumination to enable nighttime operation, improve operational availability of the HMDS during inclement weather and address obsolescence and Cyber Security deficiencies.

The Route Clearance &amp; Interrogation System (RCIS) program executes an Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase for Type I systems with an OEM contract award for Delta High Mobility Engineering Excavator (HMEE) support and a contract award  in 4th quarter of FY 2018 to one EMD contractor for the Semi-Autonomous Control (SAC) Kit . The SAC Kit was awarded based on a source selection from full and open competition.  The SAC EMD contract awardee will execute Preliminary Design Review (PDR), design, integration, and build phase of seven Semi-Autonomous Capability (SAC) kits, integrated onto six vehicles, with one kit available for engineering and System Integration Lab (SIL) evaluations.  These assets enable the Government to execute a full Pre-Production Qualification Test (PPQT) and to evaluate against Capability Production Document (CPD) and performance specification requirements. Production and Technical Data Package (TDP) procurement options on the EMD contract take advantage of competition to assist in cost reduction. The RCIS Type I program Lifecycle Cost Estimate (LCCE), and associated budget request, was updated based on costs associated with modifying the base HMEE platform to accept the SAC kit, changes in the acquisition strategy and alignment of development and test activities in support of a production decision. To support EMD, ALUGS is funding Reset/Recap of four Buffalo Mine Protected Clearance Vehicle (MPCV) test assets at Letterkenny Army Depot. These will be provided to the SAC contractor for Operator Control Unit (OCU) integration.  

The Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) (formerly known as AMDS) is currently in the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase to provide standoff detection, marking, and neutralization of explosive hazards (e.g., landmines, improvised explosive devices (IED), booby-traps (explosive), and unexploded ordnance (UXO)) in complex and urban terrain, including confined areas and subterranean environments (e.g., buildings, bunkers, tunnels, etc.). Transition to Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) occurred 30 April 2018 under PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335, for the neutralization capability, as well under OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) for the detection and marking capabilities.  Due to the realignment of funds beginning FY 2020 through FY 2024 to higher Army priorities, the proponent withdrew support to the Standoff Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (SREHD) after Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) award.  Subsequently, the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) directed that FY 2019 funding will not be executed for this program.  Due to timing, funding is still reflected in FY 2019.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE) tasks will conclude in FY 2019 under FY 2018 PE 0654808A, Project 415, Landmine Warfare/Barrier - Eng Dev, once corrective action plans and trainer re-development are completed. The program will conclude in June 2020 under FY 2018 OPA R68260 / AREA MINE DETECTION SYSTEM (AMDS) and PAA E50510 / DEMO KIT, BLASTING: Munition Array Charge, XM335 for system qualification and production and receipt of LRIP quantities for an orderly program closeout.

Robotic Explosive Hazard Detection System (REHDS) is a new start in FY 2021 and begins in the Engineering Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase.  REHDS will develop the capability to detect and mark explosive hazards from a robotic platform to deliver standoff capability to the warfighter. REHDS will leverage developed SREHDS capability and incorporate the following two changes: Increased Rate of Advanced Downtrack (RoAD) and Integration to Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) II platform. REHDS has planned efforts in FY 2022 and FY 2023; dollar amounts are $6.000 million and $7.000 million respectively. Plan to execute a sole source strategy utilizing the SREHD contractor as they have the ability to develop similar systems.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network, LOE 2 - Common Operating Environment and LOE 4 - Command posts. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Project 323, the Common Hardware Systems (CHS), is an ACAT III program and is a mandated Army Strategic Source that acquires and sustains highly flexible, cost effective, and simplified non developmental C5ISR solutions that integrates the latest and emerging commercial technology onto the Converged Mission Command Network. This funding line supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2, Common Operating Environment. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy. CHS provides technical support, environmental and survivability testing, system design, end of life/configuration management, and strengthens cybersecurity/supply chain risk management across Army tactical programs to ensure interoperability and integration of hardware throughout the computing infrastructure. CHS continuously analyzes and tracks hardware from cradle-to-grave, from emerging technology until end-of-life. CHS conducts hardware evaluations that facilitate and simplify the selection of common hardware solutions across numerous Army programs and agencies including: Mission Command; Tactical Network; Tactical Radios; Distributed Common Ground Station Army; Aviation Systems; Counter Rocket, Artillery, Mortar; Communication Electronics Command; Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC), among others. CHS rapidly procures common hardware configurations across the Integrated Tactical Network (ITN), Common Operating Environment (COE), the sustainment community, and tactical programs that enables the continuous modernization in support of all four Network Modernization Lines of Effort and Network Cross Functional Team (CFT) requirements. CHS logistical services include worldwide 72 hour turnaround repair through strategically located support centers for tactical military units, tailorable supply chain and cybersecurity measures, manages customizable warranty, maintenance and failure rate reporting, and technical support services to support specific Army program requirements. CHS supports better buying power initiatives by creating efficiencies through economies of scale, price breaks, streamlined processes, reduced cycle times, and centralized contracting.
 
Project C29, the Central Technical Support Facility (CTSF), is the Army's single strategic facility responsible for executing Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) system of system verification/validation checkout, testing, and configuration management for the Army's LandWarNet Baseline. The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF) funding line supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort LOE 1B Network Enabling Functions.

Project C34, the Army Tac C2 Sys Eng project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) the System-of-Systems engineering, Enterprise and Integration efforts.  The system engineering efforts are to facilitate the overall network interoperability of all the various programs that must be able to seamlessly connect together while addressing their individual distinct requirements.  Efforts address continuing evolution of the network within the PEO C3T portfolio of technology across capability enhancement packages, in line with the Network CFT capability set strategy, to deliver efficient and effective cross-domain technical solution. 

Project EJ4, the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE), is one of the computing environments under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative, a major Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort of the Network Cross-Functional Team (N-CFT). CPCE provides a common software infrastructure framework (common interface, data, and services) upon which future Warfighter capabilities can be built. CPCE development efforts initially target Movement and Maneuver capability development at tactical echelons that span from Army Service Component Commands (ASCC) to Battalion level. The CPCE will be the central computing environment developed to support command posts and combat operations, and will be interoperable with Mounted and Mobile/Handheld systems.

Project EJ5, the Mounted Computing Environment (MCE), is one of the six computing environments (CEs) formalized by the AAE under the Common Operating Environment (COE) initiative. MCE standardizes end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new warfighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command - Platform program. Requirements for the MCE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the approved Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP). The MCE will provide incremental improvements with additional application capabilities over time, and will be interoperable with Command Post and Mobile/Handheld systems.


Project EJ6, Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Terrestrial Transmission (TRILOS) and Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TRILOS and TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current WIN-T SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to WIN-T Program of Record satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on WIN-T satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY 2028/2029). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. 
 
Project EK9, Tactical Networks Operational Management (TNOM)'s purpose is to create Unified Network Operations (UNO).  UNO is a software based, integrated NetOps capability being developed, as a rapid prototype - proceeding under Section 804, mid-tier acquisition (MTA) authority granted by the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE)'s 14 May 2019 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). Enabling common planning, configuration, monitoring, provisioning, management, and defense of the Network, UNO configures and integrates tactical and enterprise networks to allow delivery of information and communications among Soldiers at all echelons utilizing network resources prioritized according to the Commander's intent. In developing UNO, TNOM follows the Army's development operations (DevOps) approach - creating NetOps prototypes, gaining user feedback, making adjustments and ultimately delivering enhanced capabilities to the operational force in the shortest time possible. UNO development incorporates solutions available in industry and through government agencies - assessing them in an adapt and buy approach informed by experimentation, demonstration, and modernization.

Project EQ8, Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment, supports the Nett Warrior (NW) Program (named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Robert C. Nett), also known as the Ground Soldier System (GSS) Program.  The program leverages commercial smart devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness system for use during combat operations.  The NW system provides leaders electronic real-time information on friendly positions; information about enemy activity and movement; navigational data and map imagery; a collaborative planning tool; and other mission related graphics which effectively puts the power of the entire Army tactical network in the hands of the dismounted leader.  

Project ER9, Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2), fields mobile Command Post nodes by integrating mission command solutions to enhance the survivability and mobility of command post formations.  CPI2 will replace selected elements of the legacy command post to provide improved expeditionary capability, survivability, agility, and scalability for command post formations at all echelons. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move.  

Project EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR) funding line supports the Army Network Plan Framework objective to deliver a Standards Based Network Architecture. This will enable modernizing the Mission Command Network through the coordination of a common set of network operations tools and infrastructure development supporting the unit communication staff's ability to conduct Network Planning, Network Provisioning and Network Management. Network Planning efforts include the development of an integrated planning tool suite to improve Signal Soldiers ability to plan and develop configurations for upcoming operations and deployments. Network Provisioning efforts include development of tools and technology that provide a means to deliver configurations developed during the Network Planning with little to no manual involvement by the Soldier. Network Management efforts replace stove-piped management systems and replaces them with integrated tools that provide a consolidated, as well as detailed, view of the network and its components.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project C29, The Centralized Technical Support Facility (CTSF): The CTSF is the Army's premier test and certification facility for System of Systems interoperability, functioning as CIO/G6's designated independent test agent and Land/WarNet/Mission Command (LWN/MC) configuration manager. The Central Technical Support Facility's (CTSF) directed mission is to perform Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) testing and configuration management for all operational through tactical level Command, Computing, Control, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) systems (individual, family, and system of systems), applications, and hardware prior to release to the field.  The CTSF accomplishes this through the enforcement of a standards based architecture while supporting the development and implementation of an integrated computing infrastructure and a converged network.  The CTSF provides validated test data to the Department of the Army and Joint agencies to accredit interoperability certifications. The distributed test environment of the CTSF is accomplished through the Federation of Net-centric Sites (FaNS) construct. This FaNS construct addresses distributed integration development and testing using the core infrastructure of the CTSF to harness Army and Joint expertise/resources. Through these federated resources, the CTSF executes or supports interoperability development, integration and certification testing of the systems and system of systems in the Warfighter Mission Area, to include Network Evaluation spinouts, as they become part of the Army's LandWarNet. The cited work is consistent with Strategic Planning Guidance and the Army Modernization and Strategy Plan.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project C34, Army TAC C2 Sys Eng, supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Project C34 coordinates technical efforts across and outside of PEO C3T to ensure integration with the current and future Mission Command Network. Project C34 provides technical support for programs aligned and in support of LOEs 1 through 4 that informs the design and solutions with specific emphasis on the ability for the different efforts to be integrated and interoperable with one another.  Efforts support the Network CFT capability set strategy.

Project C34, Army Tactical Command and Control Systems Engineering: This project funds the PEO Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) System of Systems engineering and integration, experimentation, acquisition management, testing, fielding and sustainment support to ensure interoperability and affordability within the PEO C3T portfolio. The effort focuses on System-of-Systems (SoS) Engineering and Integration for the Mission Command Network with increased emphasis on immediate Warfighter needs as well as leveraging emerging technologies. 

Fiscal Year 2021 will focus on the continued development, implementation and integration of the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) network architectures. This includes maturing the technology enhancement roadmap for SoS capability evolution across the PEO C3T portfolio that incorporates Cross Functional Team initiatives; network integration support and design products for system validation through various N-CFT lead experimentation and integration testing; integration of tactical networked capabilities for all Mission Command Network systems and integration events; integration of tactical information assurance solutions and security measures for consistent cyber protection; and support to N-CFT evaluations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2, Common Operating Environment (COE). Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform).  The Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the movement and maneuver applications, common computing services such as Cyber tools and e-mail, and includes tactical server capabilities within Command Posts at all echelons (Battalion to Army Service Component Commander).

To mitigate potential misalignments with the requirements community, the program increment designations will align with validated requirement documents. Accordingly, the former Increment 2 is now designated as Increment 1 to align with Capability Drop 1. Increment 1, which was approved via Full Deployment Decision in July 2019 and currently fielded, is now designated Increment 0. CPCE Increment 0 requirements are detailed in the Minimum Essential Capabilities document.  

The CPCE implements an integrated, interoperable, cyber-secure, cost-effective software infrastructure that serves as the host for a unified set of multiple warfighting functional applications within the command post. This software infrastructure will be central to the COE, allowing interoperability between command posts, mounted platforms, and dismounted handheld devices while supporting collaboration using a common picture with Joint and Unified Action partners. CPCE will provide a core software infrastructure including a common operating picture (COP) tool, common look and feel (user interface), common data strategy, interoperable tactical messaging/chat, and essential movement and maneuver capabilities. CPCE software infrastructure and applications will reside on Tactical Server Infrastructure (TSI) hardware and previously fielded BCCS/TSI servers. The CPCE eliminates "stove-piped" legacy systems, duplicative or redundant implementations, simplifies future application development efforts, and enhances interoperability and data sharing across multiple echelons.  

CPCE employs an agile development approach, in two year increments, with capabilities being integrated to support the Army IS COE effort. Increment 0 includes core infrastructure and initial movement and maneuver capabilities.  Increment 1 of the program will meet the requirements of the CPCE Requirements Definition Package and Capability Drop 1, and bring enhancements to Increment 0 and initial system convergence. Increment 2 will bring additional warfighting function capabilities and enhancements to existing capability.  

FY 2021 funding will support the consolidation, adjudication, and codification of specific technical requirements for CPCE Increment 1 with focus on the support of legacy system infrastructure requirements and begin requirements planning and design phase of CPCE Increment 2.

In accordance with DoD direction that procurement and modification of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products is the preferred acquisition approach, CPCE procured a COTS battle management system to serve as the underlying core infrastructure, and is modifying that COTS product to meet additional Army requirements, including backwards compatibility with legacy systems.  For development of additional capabilities to be integrated into the COTS system, CPCE follows the Agile development approach (Epics, Iterations, and Sprints) that allows capabilities to be engineered, developed and tested rapidly. The Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) Armaments Center Weapons and Software Engineering Center (WSEC) and the Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Software Engineering Center (SEC) are prime Government partners in system development.  Commercial suppliers are assigned efforts through GSA Mission Command Engineering Services vehicles and Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts.

Hardware (server) platforms are COTS and procured under the Tactical Services Infrastructure (TSI) funding line through existing vehicles from GSA, Common Hardware Systems (CHS) and the Army Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS).

CPCE Inc 0 brings the core software infrastructure and initial movement and maneuver capabilities. Inc 1 will meet the requirements of the CPCE Requirements Definition Package and Capability Drop 1, and focuses on enhancements to Inc 0, and enabling legacy system convergence. Inc 2 will bring additional warfighting function capabilities and enhancements to existing capability.  

The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) approved the TSI Acquisition Strategy on 17 May 2019 and issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) approving a Full Deployment Decision (FDD) to field CPCE Increment 0 capability on the TSI.  CPCE Inc 0 underwent Initial Operational Test &amp; Evaluation in Nov 2018 and conditional authority to field the capability was granted on 15 Jul 19.  The CPCE Inc 1 Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 9 Sep 2019 authorizing entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase of the acquisition lifecycle.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments (i.e., server(s), client, mobile, sensors, and platform). The Mounted Computing Environment (MCE) is one of six computing environments under the COE, which provides standardization of end-user environments and enables streamlined deployment of new war-fighting applications while leveraging existing hardware under the Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) program.

The MCE supports LOE 2 by utilizing:
- Interoperable data, message, and waveforms
- Sensors and applications that enable operations across domains
- Integration with Joint C5ISR and strike capabilities
- Increased interoperability with the Command Post Computing Environment and Mobile Handheld Computing Environment 

Requirements for the MCE are established in the Army Requirements Oversight Council (AROC)-approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD) and the Mounted Computing Environment Requirements Definition Package (RDP). 

MCE's Materiel Development Decision (MDD) is scheduled for 2QFY20.

MCE employs a Developmental Operations (DevOps) process to incrementally develop capability over time to satisfy requirements and meet fielding decisions. FY 2021 funding will continue DevOps activities to incorporate new capability and enhancements based on user feedback, as well as lay the groundwork to support migration of third-party applications onto the MCE software baseline. Additionally, FY 2021 funding provides for initial test instrumentation and risk reduction events/preparation to support a v3.1 Operational Test (OT) and Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) scheduled for 1QFY22.

MCE's RDT&amp;E resources are used to improve and add software applications while JBC-P RDT&amp;E is used to improve JBC-P hardware, network performance and add network resiliency.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The Mounted Computing Environment (MCE) is the Army's initiative to provide simple and intuitive Mission Command on-the-Move (MCOTM) and situational awareness down to the platoon level. It is standards based, protected and supports incremental improvements with additional application capabilities over time. MCE will leverage the existing JBC-P hardware and network, and be deployed as a software upgrade to replace the legacy JBC-P software. It will support a common look and feel and is part of the solution enabling leaders to lead and fight their formations from anywhere they choose.

MCE is utilizing an incremental development approach, leveraging DevOps, to ensure capability satisfies requirements and addresses Warfighter feedback. This agile development process injects enhancements into the baseline software, making it easier to incorporate technological advances. The project office conducts commercial software assessments to determine applicability and suitability for inclusion in the MCE baseline.

Software development increments and fielding decisions will be implemented with an agile 2 year capability set tech insertion construct. Software development will be manageable, tailorable, and scalable in the Capability Assessment Package (CAP) format to enable better management of capability delivery. MCE's v3.1 First Unit Equipped (FUE) is scheduled for 4QFY22; subsequent SW versions are planned to implement over-the-air updates reducing the sustainment footprint necessary to deploy and maintain multiple software baselines.

MCE's Materiel Development Decision (MDD) is scheduled for 2QFY20.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Tactical Enhancement supports the evaluation and testing requirements for Troposcatter Transmission (TROPO) capabilities procured and fielded under the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) funding line, B00010. TROPO will provide redundancy communications in a Satellite denied environment by providing improved Line of Sight and beyond line of sight radio systems. 

In addition this funding will support development of Network Centric Waveform-Resilient (NCW-R). NCW-R is a critical, near-term set of modifications to the current Tactical Network SATCOM waveform that will provide limited protection against our adversaries' ability to jam tactical SATCOM Command and control communications on Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellites.   NCW-R will provide anti- jam capability and resiliency to Tactical Network satellite terminals in contested environments. The NCW-R waveform software will operate on Tactical Network satellite modems.  NCW-R will provide a bridging capability until the next generation protected satellite constellation is launched by the Air Force (projected FY 2028/2029). The current anti-jam protection is limited to two SMART-T terminals per BCT, division and Corps HQs, leaving battalions vulnerable to being isolated during jamming events. 

SIGMOD Capabilities: 

TROPO: Enables Mission Command in a Satellite Denied environment by providing Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability over longer ranges and at higher throughput than the current BLOS System.  TROPO extends the network by utilizing a significantly reduced SWaP radio verses the current system. TROPO will enable Army units to reduce reliance on costly satellite bandwidth.

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>These funds will be used to conduct System Evaluation and Formal Testing of the various Signal Mod capabilities, specifically the TROPO systems. This is in order to facilitate integration into the Tactical Networks. These test events will meet all mandatory testing requirements with full ATEC oversight. This Acquisition Strategy will integrate proven Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) capabilities into existing Tactical Network nodes to expand and enhance network capacity and user access. The TROPO capabilities are acquired as ACAT III programs to replace legacy equipment in the field while utilizing DoDI 5000.02 standard acquisition approaches, starting with Milestone C Determination for TROPO (4QFY18).</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EQ8 - The Common Operating Environment (COE) is an approved set of computing technologies and standards that enables secure and interoperable applications to be developed and executed rapidly across a variety of computing environments. The Mobile/Handheld Computing Environment (M/HHCE) is one of the six computing environments under the COE, which provides the standards for all Army hand held applications enabling the use of common End User Devices by Soldiers, thereby eliminating redundant devices and reducing the Soldiers' load.

The M/HHCE is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) 1 (Unified Network). M/HHCE also supports the Army Network Modernization Strategy LOE 2 (Common Operating Environment).  These efforts are aligned to the Army's Tactical Network Capability Set development and fielding plans by utilizing (1) interoperable data, message, and waveforms, (2) sensors and applications that enable operations across domains and (3) integration with Joint C4ISR and strike capabilities. Nett Warrior (NW) and Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) are the instantiation of the M/HHCE and comply with the technical standards documented by the M/HHCE and provide the dismounted common computational platform for other products relevant to dismounted Soldiers. Through compliance with the M/HHCE, software applications from other programs are integrated with the NW and IVAS systems, reducing the need for duplicate hardware resulting in reduced Soldier Load. NW leverages commercial smart phone devices and secure Army tactical radios to provide the dismounted leader an integrated mission command and situational awareness capability for use during combat operations. NW applied feedback from conventional and Special Operations units to procure and implement Secret and Secure But Unclassified (SBU) networking equipment for BCTs and the Security Force Assistance Brigades to enable faster, more flexible Mission Command data exchanges with Joint and Coalition forces while maintaining the existing integrated mission command capability with Mounted CE (e.g., JBCP) system. NW uses Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non Developmental (NDI) communications equipment to create a robust and flexible Integrated Tactical Network that enables faster and more accurate decision making in fights at the tactical level.

Requirements for the M/HH CE are established in the AROC approved COE Information Systems Initial Capability Document (IS ICD), the M/HHCE Requirements Definition Package (RDP), and the NW Capability Development Document in lieu of Capability Production Document.  This project is in the Army's Top 100 Modernization efforts.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>To capitalize on commercial industry's investment in advanced smart device technology as well as innovation and changes within Army, NW requires annual RDT&amp;E funding for integration and evaluation of new technology. Through this process and at low cost, the Army is able to integrate and evaluate for combat utility the hundreds of millions spent in product development by the major commercial device manufactures.  The Nett Warrior (NW) program provides situational awareness and mission command to dismounted combat leaders through a secure commercial smart device, power source, cables and the Integrated Tactical Network.  NW funds development and evaluation of new technology and software integration through a combination of competitively awarded contracts.  Various existing follow on procurement contracts are utilized to procure a combination of COTs and GOTs NW equipment to include supporting services.  NW program completed LRIP/MS C in 2012 followed by two LRIP decisions in 2013-14 in preparation for IOT&amp;E under DOT&amp;E oversight in 4QFY14- 1QFY15. This IOT&amp;E event led to an additional NW Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) decision in 2015 and a Full Rate Production Decision in FY17. Now in production, NW seeks operational feedback and uses the DevOps process to identify and implement new capabilities.  M/HHCE standards are updated annually under the M/HHCE governance process.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>This funding line is directly aligned to the Army Network Modernization Strategy Line of Effort (LOE) #4 Command Post.  Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

Program will implement capabilities in a two increment approach.  Increment 1 will implement prototype capabilities as identified in signed Directed Requirement and Increment 2 will execute the requirements identified in Capability Development Document (CDD) due for review/approval in 2QFY20.  These capabilities will enable the Army to employ command posts across the operational spectrum, from early entry to major combat operations that will resolve current command post issues with set up and tear down, survivability, mobility, suitability and footprint. 

The Command Post Integrated Infrastructure (CPI2) program addresses the requirements for more mobile, scalable, interoperable, and agile command posts. Currently fielded command posts are deemed too large and take too long to setup and teardown making them vulnerable to near peer detection and targeting technologies. By integrating mission command warfighting functions on to formation appropriate vehicle platforms, a dispersed command post construct will enable the battle staff to blend in with the overall maneuver formation while giving the commander the ability to synchronize the close fight on the move. This dispersed mobile command post consists of Mission Command Platforms (MCPs) and Command Post Support Vehicles (CPSVs). The MCP is a formation appropriate vehicle that provides digital workstations for all mission command warfighting functions. The CPSV is the hub of the dispersed command post; it hosts mission command servers, radios, local area network components and a secure wireless capability. Specific to CORPS/DIV, CPI2 will provide a Mobile Command Group (MCG) consisting of formation appropriate platforms that supports Corps/Div Commanders/Staff with high priority functions while on the move.  

FY 2021 initiates Inc 2 portion of the program to address design engineering and prototype development for formation-appropriate MCPs, MCGs, and CPSVs and includes design changes to platform shelters as required based on results of experimentation.  Funds will also support integration and testing for Increment 1 with 2 BCT's and a Division Main to obtain user feedback to drive future requirements.  Includes funding for engineering changes, test and training, CPI2 program management.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The CPI2 Materiel Development Decision (MDD) Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed on 21 June 2018 and directs CPI2 to be executed in a two increment approach. Increment 1 will develop capabilities to address needs identified in the signed Command Post (CP) Directed Requirement (DR) to field 5 Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) , a Division and a platform based  Mobile Command Group (MCG) to 1 Division and 1 Corps.  Using the buy, try, assess, and decide acquisition model which leverages user experimentation to inform follow-on program requirements.  Increment 1 will prototype and integrate available commercial off the shelf (COTS) as well as  government programs of record (PORs) equipment that provide mission command and communications functions within the command post. Increment 2 will execute requirements per the CPI2 Capability Development Document (CDD) to replace designated legacy command post systems at Corps, Division, Brigade combat Team's, their subordinate Battalion (BN) formations and select Multi-functional Support Brigades (MFSB).  

Increment 1 will work with the government and with industry to capitalize on their experiences with mobile Command Posts to perform risk reduction events on experimental solutions for the Command Post Support Vehicle and Mission Command Platform as outlined in the Command Post Directed Requirement (DR). 

CPI2 Inc 1 will develop the BCT #1 through experimentation conducted with Combat Capabilities Development Center (CCDC) via a Functional Support Agreement (FSA) for  BCT #1.  CPI2 will leverage industry advancements and innovation using full and open competition with the C5SIR Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to design and prototype the MCP/CPSV for the BCT #2.  CPI2 will experiment at the Division main executing an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  CPI2 will deliver a platform based Mobile Command Group (MCG) to 1 Division via an FSA with Project Manager (PM) Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT).  The integration efforts will culminate with test events on all prototype designs, leading to a Milestone in FY21 to select the Command Post (CP) solution set for fielding the remaining 3 BCTs and 1 MCG to a Corps identified in the CP DR.

The CPI2 CDD specifies Increment 2 requirements and is scheduled for AROC review/approval on 7 Feb 2020.  A Milestone B in 3QFY20 for Inc 2 will authorize RDTE efforts to focus on design/development of unit appropriate platforms which will be executed via FSA with platform Program of Record (POR) contracts.  A Milestone C for Increment 2 in FY23 will initiate the fielding of CPI2 to designated Army units.  Future editions of the CDD will incorporate feedback based on prototype experimentation, user feedback and advances in technology.  CPI2 plans to compete a contract with industry for the design, engineering, test and production of the CDD solution for CPI2.  Additionally, CPI2 will leverage existing contracts managed by Joint Program Office Light Tactical Vehicle (JPO JLTV), Product Manager (PdM) Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and PM SBCT for integration efforts associated with their respective platforms.  This will encompass CPI2 variants at designated Corps, Division, Brigade, Battalion and select Multi-Functional Support Brigades.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Project EW3, Unit Task Reorganization (UTR), supports the Army's Network Modernization Strategy LOE 1, Unified Network. Efforts are aligned to support the Network-Cross Functional Team capability set approach to achieve the network modernization strategy.

UTR supports the Army Network Plan Framework objective to deliver a Standards Based Network Architecture.  This will enable the modernization of the Mission Command Network through the coordination of a common set of network operations tools and infrastructure development supporting the unit communication staff's ability to conduct Network Planning, Network Provisioning and Network Management.  Network Planning includes the development of an integrated planning tool suite to improve Signal Soldiers ability to plan and develop configurations for upcoming operations and deployments. Network Provisioning includes the development of tools and technology that provide a means to deliver configurations developed during the Network Planning with little to no manual involvement by the Soldier.  Network Management results in the replacement of stove-piped management systems and with integrated tools that provide a consolidated, as well as detailed, view of the network and its components.

FY 2021 UTR funding will be used to continue development of network components that support centralized data, security, and information exchanges; continue development of Network Planning functions to plan the tactical network to continue development of Radio Planning capabilities in order to plan and create configuration files for emerging ITN radios and waveforms; continue development of network device and radio provisioning systems and continue the development of a network manager that monitors and displays network health status, performance, location and security to local operator.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is a key component of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture and provides critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>Mission &amp; System Description:

This system is a component of the overall Air and Missile Defense (AMD) architecture and will provide for an incrementally fielded Integrated Air and Missile Defense Fire Control System/capability for the composite Army Air and Missile Defense Brigades.  The Sentinel system is a key component of the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense (AIAMD) architecture and provides critical air surveillance of the forward areas.

Sentinel consists of a radar-based sensor with its prime mover/power, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Command, Control and Intelligence (C2I) interfaces. The radar is deployed in both an air defense role and a force protection role for Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) missions.  The sensor is an advanced three-dimensional battlefield X-Band air defense phased-array radar with an instrumented range of 75 kilometers.  Sentinel is capable of operating day or night, in adverse weather conditions, in the battlefield environments of dust, smoke, aerosols and enemy countermeasures.  It provides 360-degree azimuth coverage for acquisition tracking.  Sentinel contributes to the digital battlefield by automatically detecting, classifying, identifying and reporting targets (cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, rotary wing and fixed wing aircraft). Sentinel acquires targets sufficiently forward of the battle area to allow weapons reaction time and engagement at optimum ranges.  Sentinel's integrated IFF reduces the potential for fratricide of US and Coalition aircraft.

The Research and Development funding supports Sentinel modernization/upgrades to address obsolescence issues and capabilities gaps.  Sentinel A4 modernization efforts will increase detection, recognition and identification range by 100%, add RAM detection, increase electronic protect and allow for system capability growth through FY 2050 to address evolving threat.

FY 2021 Funds address the following:

The Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) (Sentinel A4) is the next generation of radar technology to replace the current phase and frequency scanned array used by Sentinel today.  The AESA Antenna will provide increased capability including extended range for ground-based surveillance and situational awareness, faster and more accurate Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) for clearing fires and preventing fratricide, improved Fire Control (FC) quality track accuracy, and management of larger track loads.  The AESA will also provide improved operation in severe/urban clutter.  The system will detect and track small targets, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Cruise Missiles, in clutter and will detect and track slow targets, such as UAS and Rotary Wing (RW) aircraft, at low altitudes in clutter.  The system will detect, track, and classify Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats and will support Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) requirements and can contribute sensor support for mitigating current and future Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 mission requirements. The Sentinel A4 will incorporate Mode S technologies.

Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect (EA/EP) addresses the electronic countermeasures (ECM) gap.  This effort continues through the life of the radar, addressing both changing threats and electronic counter measure gaps.

Counter Rocket, Artillery &amp; Mortars (C-RAM) capability increase to current Sentinel A3's effectiveness against the Low, Slow, Small (LSS), UAS, Cruise Missile, and RAM threat.  This effort develops and implements advanced waveforms and processing to significantly enhance RAM capabilities.  These efforts will provide fire control quality data to support LSS, UAS, CM, and RAM interceptors.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Sentinel was procured from Raytheon as a non-developmental item.  Raytheon owns the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Sentinel A3 and its predecessors and therefore no other contractor has the technical ability to modify the Sentinel radar or Sentinel software.  The modifications planned for the Sentinel that fall into this category are:  Electronic Attack/Electronic Protect; Signal Data Processor; North Finding Module; Medium Bandwidth; Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM); Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM), Low Slow Small, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Cruise Missiles; and Mode S. 

Sentinel System of Systems (Sentinel A3):  The Sentinel Product Office will contract with Raytheon for risk reduction efforts in the development of the software package to support the identification and engagement of Low Slow Small target sets.  The Sentinel Product Office will work with Other Government Agencies to finalize integration and test of the IAMD B Kit on board the Sentinel platform and to add simulation capability to allow a high fidelity representation of Sentinel to IAMD.

For the Sentinel A4 modification, Lockheed Martin was competitively awarded a Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) contract to develop a modified Sentinel with a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementNote>Effective February 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.75 was issued to establish policy for use of Business Capability Acquisition Cycle for Defense Business Systems, applying to the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS). GFEBS is currently in Phase 5, Capability Support.</r2:ProgramElementNote>
            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>DV6 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) leveraging the GFEBS base system as the Army's core financial management system certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS base system without compromising classified information or missions, or endangering soldiers. Therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPR), leveraging off of the sustained system design while providing additional implementation that includes additional requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPR and NIPR with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology, and will modify capability to maintain a synchronized software baseline with the GFEBS base system to maintain efficiencies in capability enhancements, training documentation, and sustainment support. 
In FY 2021 the GFEBS-SA system will reach Full Deployment and the RDTE funding requested will complete system upgrades and enhancements which will re-synchronize the system baseline with the GFEBS base system to account for any capability upgrades that were made to the base system while GFEBS-SA was in development. 

GF5 - General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS): GFEBS is the Army's core financial management system for administering its General Fund. Full Deployment was reached in 2012 and the system is currently in the Capability Support (sustainment) phase of the Business Acquisition Cycle, focused on modernization, cyber security, and system enhancements  while also conducting capability enhancements to meet policy and deliver a more accurate picture of Army financial awareness. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and enable the Army to comply with the Federal Financial Management. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). 
GFEBS required RDTE funding for FY 2021 is to provide capability enhancements designed to meet Yellow Book audit readiness standards, and continue to make system changes as prioritized by the functional sponsor and user community through the Process Owners Group, a Senior Executive Service/General Officer-level board. The RDTE funding will support the additional focus on completing system enhancements which enable an audit-ready Army, ensure a modern and sustainable system, and enable the retirement of legacy systems freeing up funding for investment into the modern ERP; as well as modernization efforts aligned with the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (SAP) next generation capability.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                <r2:SummaryExplanation>For FY 2021, the overall change is a result of changes to each of the child funding lines within the GFEBS Program Element.

GFEBS-SA (DV6) decreased in FY 2021 in the new President's Budget based on the accelerated timeline set forth by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. The schedule acceleration moves Full Deployment forward from its original FY 2021 scheduled date which decreases the RDTE request in FY 2021; leaving only the amount needed to provide enhancements which re-synchronize the system's baseline.

GFEBS (GF5) increased in FY 2021 in the new President's Budget based on the additional focus on completing the audit-related system enhancements which will give the Army an auditable financial system. The GFEBS Process Owners Group and Functional Governance Board have developed a list of enhancement items and have put the highest priority on those items which enable an audit-ready Army, ensure a modern and sustainable system, and enable the retirement of legacy systems freeing up funding for investment into the modern ERPs. Specifically, the additional enhancements will improve the Army's fund balance with Treasury reducing service provider personnel needed to support reconciliation activities.  This allows the Army to focus resources on mission critical activities. The increased funding also supports modernization efforts aligned with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (SAP) next generation capability. The modernization activities include code de-customization, data enablement, and improved automated data access to prevent end of support for the current database and platform.  Funds will also support acquisition trades and market research on alternatives for SAP based finance/logistics consolidation to evaluate potential efficiencies by reducing platforms and licenses.  

A congressional mark of $3.8 million was placed on FY2020 RDTE in the GFEBS (GF5) line due to GFEBS prior year carryover.</r2:SummaryExplanation>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>DV6 - General Fund Enterprise Business System-Sensitive Activities (GFEBS-SA): GFEBS-SA is a designated National Security System (NSS) leveraging the GFEBS base system as the Army's core financial management system certified by the Chief Financial Officers Council. To protect sensitive information and enable clean auditability, the Army requires a separate instance of GFEBS operated on a secure network for processing sensitive and classified financial transactions that cannot be processed in the fully-fielded GFEBS base system without compromising classified information or missions, or endangering soldiers. Therefore, GFEBS-SA is an essential financial program designed to enable the auditability that is needed to comply with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), and prevent compromise of data that could cause grave harm to U.S. forces. GFEBS-SA is envisioned as a fully functional GFEBS application operated on a secure network (SIPR), leveraging off of the sustained system design while providing additional implementation that includes additional requirements designed to protect sensitive intelligence operations and special operations missions. It will process Secret Collateral and below information while providing GFEBS capabilities such as distribution and execution of appropriated funds, cost management, financial reporting, and asset management. GFEBS-SA will be implemented and deployed to 3,000 users across 100 locations worldwide. GFEBS-SA will support information exchanges with organizations that support the Army's sensitive activities mission, including cross-security domain integration between SIPR and NIPR with GFEBS and other system partners. Services will be capable of being upgraded throughout the life of the program in order to incorporate advances in best business practices and technology, and will modify capability to maintain a synchronized software baseline with the GFEBS base system to maintain efficiencies in capability enhancements, training documentation, and sustainment support. 

In FY 2021 the GFEBS-SA system will reach Full Deployment and the RDTE funding requested will complete system upgrades and enhancements which will re-synchronize the system baseline with the GFEBS base system to account for any capability upgrades that were made to the base system while GFEBS-SA was in development.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>GFEBS-SA will be fully deployed in FY 2021; therefore, there are no procurement dollars budgeted in the GFEBS-SA line for FY 2021 and beyond. GFEBS base program procurement dollars will be used to prevent end of service life by the Original Equipment Manufacturer, SAP, and enable a migration of the GFEBS-SA database from Oracle to SAP as part of the synchronization between GFEBS and GFEBS-SA in FY2021.  Additionally, procurement funds will be leveraged to support deployments in conjunction with GFEBS-SA Full Deployment schedule to sites not currently running the GFEBS base system.

GFEBS-SA OMA requirements begin in FY 2021, which is the scheduled Full Deployment date. These requirements will be incorporated into the GFEBS base system Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) request.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>Plan, develop, and manage GFEBS-SA as a separate instance from GFEBS base program on the SIPRNet to support delivery of capabilities for this designated National Security System (NSS) in support of the sensitive activity commands. The GFEBS-SA solution was acquired as a sole source contract with Accenture Federal Services as a single increment. The contract is a hybrid of Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee CLINs to support development efforts and to encourage Accenture Federal Services to deliver a solution in support of the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army recommendation to accelerate the schedule to ensure operational security and Army audit requirements. The contract was awarded in April 2017.

Software is being developed through a single build to achieve full capability. GFEBS-SA will consist of a single software release delivered in a limited deployment to the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) unit, followed by a full deployment to all other users upon successful completion of IOT&amp;E.

The program will require modernization enhancements after full deployment. These modernization enhancements will require a stream of RDT&amp;E funding to keep the GFEBS-SA system synchronized with the base system by making modifications needed for audit readiness, compliance, and upgrades required to keep the system up-to-date with SAP standards and Functional Governance Board requirements.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>GF5 - General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS): GFEBS is the Army's core financial management system for administering its General Fund. Full Deployment was reached in 2012 and the system is currently in the Capability Support (sustainment) phase of the Business Acquisition Cycle, focused on modernization, cyber security, and system enhancements  while also conducting capability enhancements to meet policy and deliver a more accurate picture of Army financial awareness. GFEBS was implemented to fulfill the needs and enable the Army to comply with the Federal Financial Management. GFEBS was developed using a commercial off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system that is certified by the Chief, Financial Officer Council and provides six core financial functions (United States General Ledger (USGL), Cost Management, Funds Control, Payable Management, Real Property, Receivable Management and Reports). 

GFEBS RDTE funding in FY 2021 will support the additional focus on completing the audit-related system enhancements which will give the Army an auditable financial system designed to meet Yellow Book audit readiness standards as outlined by the United States Government Accountability Office, as well as support the continuation of system changes as prioritized by the functional sponsor and user community through the Process Owners Group, a Senior Executive Service/General Officer-level board. The GFEBS Process Owners Group and Functional Governance Board have developed a list of enhancement items and have put the highest priority on those items which enable an audit-ready Army, ensure a modern and sustainable system, and enable the retirement of legacy systems freeing up funding for investment into the modern ERPs. Specifically, the additional enhancements will improve the Army's fund balance with Treasury reducing service provider personnel needed to support reconciliation activities. This allows the Army to focus resources on mission critical activities. The funding also supports modernization efforts aligned with the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (SAP) next generation capability. The modernization activities include code de-customization, data enablement, and improved automated data access to prevent end of support for the current database and platform. Funds will also support acquisition trades and market research on alternatives for SAP based finance/logistics consolidation to evaluate potential efficiencies by reducing platforms and licenses.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

With increased focus on making the Army auditable, many of these upgrades are aligned with the auditability of GFEBS and have been highly prioritized. The focus for enhancements funded with RDT&amp;E during FY 2020 will be on these audit-related enhancements. Note that the program received a $3.8 million congressional mark which reduces the ability to complete all but two of the previously planned system enhancements.</r2:Text>

                        <r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>OPA - FY 2021 Procurement dollars in the amount of $4.448 million supports software and hardware infrastructure upgrades to bring GFEBS reporting and analytics in-line with processing performance thresholds established in the GFEBS Capabilities Production Document (CPD). Software upgrades support auditability requirements as well as the compliance of the system's required software standards. GFEBS base program procurement dollars will be used to prevent end of service life by the Original Equipment Manufacturer, SAP, and enable a migration of the GFEBS-SA database from Oracle to SAP as part of the synchronization between GFEBS and GFEBS-SA in FY 2021.  Additionally, procurement funds will be leveraged to support deployments in conjunction with GFEBS-SA Full Deployment schedule to sites not currently running the GFEBS base system.

OMA - [P&amp;R Form System does not show amounts for FY 2020 through FY 2025] FY 2021 and beyond OMA dollars include funding for both GFEBS and GFEBS-SA programs. OMA-funded support includes data center hosting, software/hardware maintenance, capability support, and capability enhancements.</r2:OtherProgramFundingSummaryRemarks>
                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>GFEBS is currently in the Capability Support (sustainment) phase as specified in DoDI 5000.75. On 15 January 2018, the responsibility for system support of the GFEBS system transitioned from the original developer contract to a contract created to focus more on sustainment support and cost control. The current sustainment contract provides specific contracting methodologies to track all capability support functions as well as all the system enhancement requirements as set forth by the user community through the Process Owners Group; a Senior Executive Service/General Officer-level board that prioritizes user needs. Many of these enhancements require RDT&amp;E funding as determined through a set of established business rules.

The next step on the program's contracting strategy includes a transition of all Capability Support functions to the Army Shared Services Center, and the transition of all prioritized system enhancements to a Portfolio follow-on contract supporting enhancements for the GFEBS and GFEBS-SA systems which allows the programs to realize efficiencies through a "build once, deploy twice" development strategy.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

            <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The RDT&amp;E funds for the AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 programs fund the design, development and test of primary efforts. The programs directly support the prioritization, tracking and locating of targets, and dissemination of that information for simultaneous attack of multiple threats. They provide the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counterfire target acquisition systems for all types and phases of military operations. Project L86, Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), version AN/TPQ-50 provides 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers. Project L88, AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that leverages the latest in technology design to accelerate modernization and increase range while improving false location rate, reducing obsolescence and increasing reliability. The AN/TPQ-53 provides a system with increased range and accuracy throughout a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) for locating mortar, artillery and rocket firing positions. The AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 radars are currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include operational support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Base funding in the amount of $20.008 million supports ongoing AN/TPQ-50 and AN/TPQ-53 test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), and the development and testing of modernization efforts to address extended range, electronic protection, and emerging threats in support of multi-domain operations against peer and near-peer threats.  These efforts include the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction, and required documentation.

This program line also funds development of an integrated Hypervelocity Armament System (HAS), and associated technologies as they mature to support accelerated demonstration and transition of advanced gun weapon systems, command guided maneuverable projectiles, and tactical sensors. The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in next-generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness across different gun systems. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The AN/TPQ-50 Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) is a highly mobile radar that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect. It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing 360 degrees of azimuth coverage from ranges of 500 meters to 10 kilometers and is capable of being deployed in two configurations, standalone or vehicle mounted. The AN/TPQ-50 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility. The AN/TPQ-50 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems. It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability. The AN/TPQ-50 is currently fielded to multiple Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations to include support to Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS).

The development of HAS would include advancing artillery powder guns firing Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVPs), resulting in a next generation, common, low drag, guided cannon artillery projectiles capable of completing multiple missions with improved cost effectiveness. Integration with a fire control radar and sensor array will allow closed-loop targeting of moving and relocatable targets beyond the range of conventional artillery.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Enhanced AN/TPQ-36 (AN/TPQ-53) Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System is a highly mobile radar set that automatically detects, classifies, tracks, and locates the point of origin of projectiles fired from mortar, artillery, and rocket systems with sufficient accuracy for first round fire for effect.  It mitigates close combat radar coverage gaps by providing a 90 degree search sector (stare mode) as well as 360 degree coverage (rotating) and replaces the current AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder Radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system interoperates with mission command systems to provide the maneuver commander increased counterfire radar flexibility.  The AN/TPQ-53 is deployed as part of the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system of systems.  It provides data to the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) node for the sense and warn force protection capability.  The AN/TPQ-53 currently supports contingency operations to include Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) and is fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), Field Artillery Brigades (FABs) and Division Artilleries (DIVARTYs).

The FY 2021 funds of $14.633 million supports ongoing test efforts, Army interoperability certifications (AICs), and the development and testing of modernization efforts to address extended range, electronic protection, and emerging threats in support of multi-domain operations against peer and near-peer threats.  These efforts include the performance of technical assessments, engineering studies, risk reduction and required documentation.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                        <r2:AcquisitionStrategy>The AN/TPQ-53 leverages technology developed in the multi-mission radar advanced technology objective (ATO) program.  The system replaces all of the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 systems in the fleet.  The program obtained a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision in December 2015 and awarded an FRP contract in March 2017.  The program will retrofit all initial production systems to the FRP configuration.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) increased from 174 to 189 systems in May 2017.  Following the approval of a new acquisition category (ACAT) IC acquisition program baseline (APB) in April 2019, the program procured the last 15 FRP systems on contract in the same month.  The program will complete all FRP system deliveries in FY 2021.  

RDT&amp;E funding supports modernization development and extended range software development task orders under the existing FRP contract. The efforts extend through the current Program Objective Memorandum (POM) period.</r2:AcquisitionStrategy>

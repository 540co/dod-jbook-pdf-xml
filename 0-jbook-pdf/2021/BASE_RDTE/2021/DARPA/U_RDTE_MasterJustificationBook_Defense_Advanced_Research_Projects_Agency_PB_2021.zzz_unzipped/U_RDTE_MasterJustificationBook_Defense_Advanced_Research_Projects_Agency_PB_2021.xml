                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.

The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security.

The Cyber Sciences project supported long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enabled important new military capabilities and drove the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grew in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project produced breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.

The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.

The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.

The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security.  Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery.  This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials).</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD.  However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.  The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges:  (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and/or gray zone mission outcomes.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program is exploring approaches to enable commonsense reasoning by machines.  Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and strategy games such as Chess, Go and Poker.  In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation.  This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with commonsense human cognition.  MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and commonsense knowledge repositories to support AI system development.  AI systems that are capable of more human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program is developing techniques to defend against deception attacks on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.  GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results.  Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML-based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies.  Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation.  Techniques developed under the GARD program will address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments. GARD aims to develop new algorithms and theory for ML and AI that are robust to deception attacks.</r2:Description>

Because of macro-economic interdependence, disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have widespread consequences.  World Modelers capabilities are focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings.  Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts.  The World Modelers program aims to develop techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs.</r2:Description>

Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits.  In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models.  The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.  SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design, which will impact future DoD capabilities in areas such as chemical and biological defense, and warfighter readiness.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) program is developing technology to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required to train machine learning (ML) systems.  In supervised ML, a system learns through the use of labeled training examples to recognize and categorize attributes of images, text, or speech.  Humans provide these training-data examples to ML systems and with enough labeled data, it is generally possible to build useful models. Obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be costly.  LwLL is addressing this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation.  LwLL aims to create ML systems that are easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments, especially where training data is costly or sparse.</r2:Description>

The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and national security issues.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers and the user community.  Current activities include research in fifteen topic areas spanning from Machine Learning and Many Body Physics, to Wideband Transmitter-Antenna Interfaces and Multi-Scale Models of Infectious Disease Dynamics.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs.</r2:Description>

One focus area of this thrust is developing a unified mathematical framework to enable better visualization and analysis of massive, complex data sets.  Rigorous mathematical theories are also being developed to address uncertainty in the modeling and design of complex multi-scale physical and engineering systems, incorporating capabilities to handle noisy data and model uncertainty that are well beyond the scope of current capabilities.  Other work in this thrust focuses on developing the mathematical and computational tools required to generate and better manage the enormous complexity of design, ultimately allowing designers to more easily discover non-intuitive (yet realizable) designs that fully leverage new materials and advanced manufacturing approaches now available.  Outcomes from this thrust will improve the speed and accuracy of modeling and simulation, as well as enable management of complexity across DoD devices, parts and systems. Another focus area of this thrust is multi-physics models for predicting behavior and non-intuitive failure pathways for complex, dynamic physical systems.</r2:Description>

Human language is inherently ambiguous, so humans depend on additional communication pathways, including perception of the physical world and shared context, to communicate efficiently.  CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense and encode aspects of the physical world in a perceptual structure, and to use this structure to disambiguate language.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding.  CWC also aims to extend the communication techniques developed for physical contexts to nonphysical contexts and virtual constructs.</r2:Description>

Current AI technologies are challenged in handling uncertainty and incompleteness of training protocols and data.  This has prevented the successful integration of AI technology into many transformative DoD applications.  To address these limitations the Foundational AI science thrust will focus on the development of new learning architectures that enhance AI systems' ability to handle uncertainty, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve robustness for DoD AI systems.  One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse and noisy data.  Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems as trusted human partners and collaborators.  A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated scientific discovery.  The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, and other DoD relevant applications.</r2:Description>

Despite decades of rapid advancement in electronic computing, there remain important national security relevant challenge problems that do not lend themselves to achieving tractable solutions under size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained conditions.  For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources.  Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust, also in this PE/Project, the goal of the Alternative Computing thrust is to develop novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to enable fast and accurate simulations for problems that are practically intractable using electronic computers.  Approaches considered under this thrust include the following: (1) analog computing substrates for efficiently simulating systems governed by complex non-linear phenomena; (2) multi-functional spin-based devices for scalable, efficient neuromorphic computing; (3) computing approaches that exploit the capacity of nonlinear systems to simulate nonlinear dynamical systems; and (4) quantum enabled optimization of complex systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Human-Machine Symbiosis

The Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST) program is developing intelligent software agents that can create shared mental models to enable effective teaming with humans. Theory of mind and the ability to create shared mental models are key elements of human social intelligence.  Together these skills enable human collaboration and teamwork at all scales, whether the setting is a playing field or a military mission.  The ASIST program aims to develop technologies to enable machines to exhibit similar capabilities for collaboration and teamwork with humans, capabilities which can be termed artificial social intelligence.  These would include the capability to infer the goals and situational knowledge of human partners, to predict what human partners will need, and to formulate context-aware actions having high value to a team.  The ASIST program is developing proof-of-concept software agents that demonstrate a machine theory of mind and the capability to participate with humans in an effective team by representing and helping to maintain shared models.  ASIST aims to provide the basis for machines that can participate effectively with humans on tasks where teamwork is required.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Application-Tailored Artificial Intelligence (APTAI) program will develop concepts for AI capabilities whose designs and learning processes are influenced both by training data and by key concepts and features proposed by experts in the intended application domains. In this  third wave  approach, learning processes will incorporate both human experience and patterns extracted from data to converge on informative features, representations, abstractions, and inductive strategies. One expected benefit of this approach is the emphasis on features that humans find salient, thus reducing the number of counterintuitive mistakes made by AI methods and minimizing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks, both in training data and in operations. Another expected benefit relates to human interaction, because the use of domain concepts provides a built-in framing for explanations to human partners. An additional expected benefit is the facilitation of more rapid learning processes including potentially transfer learning and one-shot learning. The APTAI program will make use of specific national security domains to drive assessment and transition of these initial concepts. Candidate domains include undersea autonomous navigation, imagery analysis, multi-modal reasoning, and games in support of strategy and planning.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Formal Methods at Scale (FMaS) program will create new mathematical methodologies, techniques, and tools for proving and providing evidence of correctness for software systems whose size and complexity renders their modeling and analysis infeasible with current techniques. Formal methods are techniques for reasoning about and proving various properties for software code or design models, generally focusing on logical relationships that connect specifications and models with executable code. A key to scalability is to focus more narrowly on particular quality or functional attributes, such as security and safety, rather than address all features and functions of the components of a software system. A second key to scalability is to provide for composability, which enables trustworthy components to be efficiently assembled into trustworthy systems. The FMaS program will accelerate this new scalable formal methods paradigm by extending formal methods techniques, tools, and practices along several dimensions, including (1) the range of properties and qualities that are modeled and reasoned about, such as relating to security, safety, performance, fault tolerance, and real-time, (2) the complexity and the size of systems and their supply chains, including issues related to composability, (3) efficiency of formal methods-related modeling, tooling, and engineering practices, including more natural integration into mainstream tooling and practices, (4) ability to rapidly co-evolve systems and associated evidence, for example to respond to rapid evolution of threats and associated mission concepts, and (5) ease of use for non-expert developers and evaluators. FMaS aims to create formal methods applicable to software systems of the size and complexity commonly encountered in military and civilian mission-critical systems, and to speed the adoption of these methods into practice and tooling.</r2:Description>

The technology development under this thrust will help address a critical need for assimilating and preserving critical national security knowledge and expertise that is currently being lost due to attrition and other factors.  Specific objectives include the following 1) effective, trustworthy and easily accepted approaches for domain agnostic knowledge acquisition at scale; 2)  capabilities to identify correlations or hidden factors relating to knowledge acquired from different sources; and 3)  techniques for incorporating domain models and other data sources for more extensive reasoning-based applications.  Example approaches towards achieving these objectives include identifying and demonstrating robust knowledge acquisition tools, exploiting AI techniques to establish a framework for knowledge analysis and causal reasoning, and developing automation tools that effectively elicit and impart acquired knowledge via user friendly interfaces.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Building Resource Adaptive Software from Specifications (BRASS) program is developing an automated framework that permits software systems to seamlessly adapt to changing resource conditions in an evolving operational environment.  The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continuance of operation.  BRASS creates tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes.</r2:Description>

Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks.  Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks in modern systems, so cyber adversaries are now finding new ways of compromising software.  Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws.  The STAC program developed analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these new attacks in the software on which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.</r2:Description>

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage "on-a-chip", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW).  Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry.  This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the size, weight, and power of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals as well as enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications.  For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels.</r2:Description>

These sugar cube-sized microrobots will have integrated thermal, light, or audio sensors to assist with location of injured persons or critical infrastructure failures.  The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of specific tests at the end of the program.  The primary technical improvements needed for untethered mobility of centimeter-sized robotic platforms are in the efficiency, robustness, and force output of millimeter-scale actuators and in the power and energy capacity of batteries and chip-level power converters. Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic-Photonic Integration (A-PhI) program is reducing the complexity of atomic clocks and gyroscopes by using integrated photonics for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications.  A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device.  PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.  While PNT needs are usually met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential.  Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term.  However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations.</r2:Description>

Electrical bandgaps determine, among other things, a transistor's maximum operating voltage, current density, thermal resistance, frequency and color (wavelength) of light emission. Consequently, wide band gaps have considerable interest for the DoD due to the need for high operating temperatures, currents, voltages and frequencies often required by emerging high power, agile Radio Frequency (RF) sources for radar, communications, directed energy and electronic warfare. This program will overcome the fundamental materials and device challenges that currently prevent implementation of UWBG materials into power, RF, and optoelectronic devices and systems. These challenges include reliably manufacturing low-defect substrates, heteroepitaxial material growth, and high concentration p-type and/or n-type doping.</r2:Description>

Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and as commercial technology reaches an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling), there is risk that future DoD needs will not be met.  The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  These basic explorations include, novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Architectures and Design program will investigate circuit architectures and design tools at both the integrated circuit and board level to provide enhanced performance and security with or without the benefit of continued scaling in silicon transistors (Moore's Law).  Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components.  As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits and to incorporating privacy and security protections.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  The program will also explore architecture options for physically protecting sensitive information.   Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create secure and specialized hardware that does not depend on continued improvements in silicon transistors. Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-02.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program will research and develop fundamentally new machine learning mechanisms, enabling machines that learn continuously as they operate.  Current learning machines are fully configured in advance of deployment, meaning that they have difficulty accounting for in-the-field mission changes or for unexpected deviations in the data being processed.  To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge.  L2M will explore network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.  These capabilities would impact a broad array of military applications that require processing and understanding data in real-time, often have limited data sets for training, and must be deployed in environments where unpredictable events may occur.</r2:Description>

The program recognizes that the densely interconnected microsystems of the future will be built through the use of groundbreaking materials, revolutionary devices, advanced architectures, and unconventional computing.  JUMP will therefore sponsor academic research teams focused on related key technology areas that will impact future DoD capabilities and national security.  The JUMP program will not only push fundamental technology research but also establish long-range microelectronic research themes with greater emphasis on end-application and systems-level computation.  By discovering the science underlying new technologies and overcoming engineering challenges, JUMP will enable DoD applications to exploit the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) and to employ both distributed and centralized computing with embedded intelligence and memory.</r2:Description>

The global information environment is radically changing how and at what rate information spreads and evolves.

Existing approaches for understanding online information spread and evolution are largely based on specialized exercises that take considerable time to orchestrate and execute, and have limited accuracy.  SocialSim aims to enable a deeper, more quantitative, and better validated understanding of adversaries' messaging campaigns and their likely outcomes, as well as exploration of potential responses.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Based on initial research conducted under the Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program, the Biology for Security (BIOSEC) program seeks to investigate novel approaches to address the DoD need for rapid detection of unknown and/or emerging biological threats from state actors or violent extremist organizations (VEOs).  This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic.</r2:Description>

This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed.  The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue.  The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing.  Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process.</r2:Description>

Complex biological materials and systems have unique properties (e.g., controlled porosity and high strength-to-weight ratios) not only because of the inherent components but also because of how those components are assembled together across length scales.  Engineering biology tools and techniques are now at a stage to pursue the organization and function of multi-cellular systems for a new class of improved capabilities.  This program is developing underlying technological platforms to enable information-driven assembly of hierarchical multi-cellular systems for the development of advanced materials.  Advances in this program will impact military approaches to infrastructure design in austere environments as well as established methods for manufacture and maintenance of military platforms (e.g., tanks, planes, ships).</r2:Description>

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in warfighter care related to health monitoring, restorative function of the body, and prevention and treatment of infectious disease. Efforts will draw upon computational modeling and experimental data to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. To enable in-theater, continuous monitoring, protection, and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including developing techniques to protect against emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and leveraging fundamental and engineered biological mechanisms to enhance tolerance to insults such as pain and altitude.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Many emerging infectious disease outbreaks have origins in animal reservoirs and occur in areas where DoD personnel are deployed, putting them at high risk of endemic and emerging diseases. The Preventing the Emergence of Disease (PED) program is investigating how animal pathogens are transmitted to humans and exploring novel approaches to prevent these events. Tools such as detailed molecular analysis and bioinformatics will be leveraged. Researchers will develop models to quantify the probability of pathogen disease transmission from animals to humans. Promising intervention approaches will be developed to prevent viral species jumps from animal reservoirs to humans. Predicting such jumps is a key capability to mitigating outbreaks originating in animal reservoirs.</r2:Description>

Research efforts will apply advances in molecular and cellular biology, cell signaling, and biomaterials to develop new tools to alter the time course of pathological processes associated with infection and tissue damage. This tactic is a departure from traditional therapeutic approaches that seek to control symptoms associated with active infections or innate physiological responses to tissue trauma. Advances in this area may be applied to the development of both prophylactic and therapeutic medical countermeasures to forward-deployed service members.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members. Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic.</r2:Description>

This program will create a platform to develop pharmacological interventions capable of modulating multiple targets within biological systems of the body, which will reduce side effects and promote safety. Research will focus on the integration of novel bioinformatics approaches, high-content physiological model systems, and new bio-orthogonal chemical synthesis methods to treat the system in order to achieve desired physiological effects. Progress in this area will lead to new pharmacological discovery and design principles that will lead to products that can be used to augment physical fitness training and maintenance for military populations. The Improved Interventions program builds upon the genomic and physiological analyses conducted under the Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program, budgeted in this PE and project.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Warfighters must operate under extreme physiological conditions with limited resources, acclimating quickly to austere environments. The Physiological Overmatch program will investigate innovative approaches to leverage biological systems to adapt to environmental challenges during deployment. The program will initiate work in aiding the deployed soldier's ability to defend against biological pathogens and chemical contaminants, resist fatigue, and receive adequate nutrition and hydration. Advances in engineered cells, bioelectronics, and cellular feedback circuits will enable the controlled, in vivo release of therapies as needed by the warfighter. This approach represents a significant enhancement to warfighter performance by providing internal protection from novel threats.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program explored new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases. Research efforts in this area applied recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness. One approach to achieve the program's goal was to identify the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults. Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species were combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival. By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, a survival blueprint is being developed to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection. This approach was orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention. Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens.</r2:Description>

Successful battlefield medical and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges to ensure warfighter readiness, including both resilience to infectious disease and neurotechnology for improved warfighter performance. To maintain warfighter health, battlefield medical technologies research in this project will investigate disease forecasting, detection, and therapeutic response. Example programs include a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak, identification of early infection biomarkers to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater, new methods to rapidly develop medical countermeasures in response to an emerging biothreat, and in-theater manufacturing capabilities for field-relevant pharmaceuticals to reduce the logistical burden and infrastructure requirements. To improve warfighter performance, this project will develop new neural architectures and data processing algorithms to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Additionally, advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare, including the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and treatment of spinal cord injury.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

In both instances, the DoD needs effective countermeasures to protect its deployed forces and maintain warfighter readiness. The Pandemic Prevention program is focusing on novel methods to rapidly accelerate countermeasure discovery, pre-clinical testing, and manufacturing. This program seeks to advance and integrate newly developed approaches including bioinformatics assessment of genetic sequencing and nucleic acid-based vaccines and to address technology bottlenecks associated with each stage of medical countermeasure development. Additional research will investigate new methods improving the manufacturability, distribution, and delivery of novel therapeutics. Pandemic Prevention will enable an integrated therapeutic development platform that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to prevent disease outbreaks.</r2:Description>

IPP will study the relationships between genotype and phenotype to identify unique physical, cognitive, and behavioral traits associated with a broad spectrum of military specialties. The program will develop technology to measure how someone uses their own genes to yield specific performance traits.  This knowledge will help the individual leverage this information to improve training, thus maximizing their potential. Measuring an individual's biological system will ensure that they achieve their maximum potential while facilitating readiness and resilience for the DoD.</r2:Description>

A major limitation of our current response to emerging biological and chemical threats is the lack of immediate availability of ideal medical countermeasures (MCM) for rapid response. The Deployable Medical Countermeasures for Warfighter Readiness program aims to develop an on-demand deployable platform to manufacture nucleic acid drugs at scale, in short timeframes. The platform will be comprised of a fully contained system capable of selectively manufacturing relevant doses of current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) grade nucleic acid therapeutics at or near the point of care. This on-demand platform will enable countermeasures capable of combating novel threats, allowing a small force to prevent regional outbreaks from becoming global emergencies.</r2:Description>

Building upon foundational work done under the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces program, this program will significantly advance treatment technologies by developing implantable, adaptive devices to address different stages of spinal cord injury (acute, sub-acute, and chronic). For early phases of injury, this program will develop technologies for real-time biomarker tracking and delivery of therapies to stabilize or rebuild nerve connections at the injury site. For final phase of injury, the Bridging the Gap after Spinal Cord Injury program will develop and integrate a network of devices deployed across the body to effectively create a synthetic nervous system and "bridge the gap" of the spinal cord injury to restore function and sensory feedback. The Bridging the Gap after Spinal Cord Injury program will dramatically improve the quality of life for wounded warfighters and veterans suffering from spinal cord injuries.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Wounded warriors often suffer from neural injury due to spinal cord injury or amputations.  Military personnel with amputated limbs get limited benefit from recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the user interface for controlling the limb is low-performance and unreliable.  Through investments in the DARPA Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program, novel interface systems have been developed that overcome these issues and are designed to last for the lifetime of the patient.  The goal of the Prosthetic Hand Proprioception &amp; Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program is to create the first bi-directional (motor &amp; sensory) peripheral nerve implant for controlling and sensing advanced prosthetic limb systems.  With a strong focus on transition, the HAPTIX program will create and transition clinically relevant technology in support of wounded warriors suffering from single or multiple limb loss.  Research in this area will also address similar interface technologies with other nerve pathways such as the spinal cord.  The anticipated transition partner is the Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program explored and developed advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity. One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies was the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior. Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders. Efforts under this program examined the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determined how to best ameliorate these disorders. The objective for this program was to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices. These tools allowed for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and enabled new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel. Technologies developed under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease program has improved military health and force readiness by leveraging advanced data collection methods and prognostic capabilities to predict changes in health and spread of infectious disease from the individual to the population scale. While new technology platforms have enhanced our ability to respond to illness and disease, there is a need for predictive and pre-emptive technologies that enable us to correctly prepare a response prior to its obvious need, such as in a barracks or in a confined environment (e.g., submarine). Research in this program  investigated new methods for the collection and detection of multiplexed biological markers as well as the analysis, correlation, and ultimate integration of vast personalized data into the clinical care information technology infrastructure. Additionally, this program developed new approaches to integrate multi-source data streams to create effective predictive models of disease outbreak and spread. Technologies developed in this program have enabled clinically actionable information, even when an individual exhibiting no symptoms, that will extend to infectious disease forecasting into a real-time, accurate capability for decision support.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Information and Communications Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is directed toward the application of advanced, innovative computing systems and communications technologies.  

The High Productivity, High-Performance Responsive Architectures project focuses on developing the computer hardware and associated software technologies required for future computationally- and data-intensive national security applications.  Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  

The Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry.

The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators.  Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas will allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity by, for example, recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program catalyzed the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics.  SC2 addressed the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 addressed these challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants were challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 conducted two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum.</r2:Description>

U.S. computer networks are continually under attack, but at present no tools exist to efficiently extract the right data from the right device at the right time to analyze these attacks for DoD-scale information networks.  For example, analysis of an in-memory exploit would require detailed data from a few devices, while analysis of a global botnet attack would require summary data from a great many devices.  CHASE is developing novel algorithms and analysis tools to dynamically collect data from across the network, actively hunt for advanced threats that evade routine security measures, and automatically disseminate protective measures that bolster the collective cyber defense posture.</r2:Description>

HACCS is developing technologies to (1) identify and characterize botnet-conscripted networks of devices to determine the types of devices and the software services running on them with sufficient precision to infer the presence of known vulnerabilities; (2) generate software exploits for a large number of known vulnerabilities that can be used to establish initial presence in each botnet-conscripted network without disrupting system functionality; and (3) create high-assurance software agents that can autonomously navigate within botnet-conscripted networks, identify botnet implants, and curtail their ability to operate while minimizing side effects to systems and infrastructure.  HACCS technologies aims to enable U.S. agencies possessing the appropriate authorities to safely conduct Internet-scale counter-botnet operations.</r2:Description>

Social engineering attacks, such as phishing and spear-phishing, typically gain user trust via impersonation to induce behaviors or elicit sensitive information that compromise security of an information system.  At present, defending against social engineering attacks falls largely to users.  ASED aims to prevent social engineering attacks by creating counter-social-engineering bots that act on behalf of users to mediate and aggregate communications and auto-identify attackers.  ASED aims to greatly reduce the effectiveness of adversary social engineering attacks and improve the security of DoD information systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources.  At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers.  This brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program is developing a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data, given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud, and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is developing the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow systems engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other quality attributes when designing complex embedded computing systems.  The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber-physical systems.  CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber-physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries.</r2:Description>

Large volumes of text-based data contain scattered clues about the activities of cyber threats.  Automated machine reading and analysis capabilities are required due to the extreme rates at which this text-based data is generated.  In addition, the connections between extracted entities and their activities can be very subtle and, because they are buried in noise, difficult to detect and correlate.  The Cora technologies will benefit cyber analysts by providing them with pre-processed cyber leads that otherwise might not be available.</r2:Description>

RADICS aims to enable skilled cyber and power engineers to rapidly restore electrical service after an attack that challenges the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations (e.g., utilities, balancing authorities, independent system operators, bulk power markets).  The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems.  RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing.  RADICS technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. government elements responsible for defense of critical infrastructure.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) program, addressing issues encountered in the Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, budgeted within this PE and Project, will develop technologies to represent the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation, for the purpose of enabling rapid code synthesis and continual adaptation.   Modern weapons platforms are increasingly dependent on complex software, increasing the risk of system failures and creating new attack surfaces for adversaries.  Software engineers often manage complexity by choosing a particular option that fulfills the immediate needs of the development effort, e.g., by concretization.  IDAS will develop techniques for deferring software concretizations until uncertainties are resolved, either at build time or during run time, for complex systems. IDAS technology aims to significantly reduce software development time and maintenance costs, thereby enabling DoD to acquire, sustain, and improve software-based capabilities more cost-effectively.</r2:Description>

At present, the emergency patching of legacy software, even if all relevant information is available, takes far too long, leaving critical systems with known flaws vulnerable to adversary attack. AMP will create the capability to analyze, modify, and fix legacy software in binary form even when the original source code and/or build process is not fully available. The AMP technical approach involves automatic discovery of known vulnerable components, goal-driven decompilation to isolate and analyze the vulnerable binary components, and minimal-change patching and recompilation to rebuild affected binaries with strong guarantees that the patch will not impair the functions of the system. The technologies developed by AMP aim to enable cyber defenders to quickly and accurately patch legacy binaries in the deployed software systems upon which our military depends.</r2:Description>

The advances produced by SIEVE will make it possible to verify statements substantially more complex than the current ZK state of the art supports, for example, statements about a software vulnerability that do not reveal details of how the vulnerability can be exploited.</r2:Description>

Today's network and computing subsystems are badly out of balance with each other, a result of incremental technology advances in networking and computing market silos.  This has produced a bottleneck at the network interface used to connect a machine to an external network, severely limiting the input/output capability.  FastNICs will develop new input/output technologies based on more realistic models of complex multiprocessor compute, interconnect, and memory subsystems.  FastNICs aims to enable a dramatic increase in computational throughput for distributed applications such as iterative training of machine learning systems.</r2:Description>

The availability of open source software for 5G will have the additional benefit of opening the mobile wireless hardware market to new participants, stimulating innovation and competition. The OPS-5G program aims to move the mobile wireless market off its current model of opaque, proprietary, and vertically-integrated technology provided by a small number of dominant vendors to a more robust model of transparent, open source technology created by a diverse ecosystem of  academic and commercial software and hardware developers.

                                                    <r2:Description>The Leveraging the Analog Domain for Security (LADS) program is developing techniques for defending information systems by advantageously using side channel signals such as radio frequency and acoustic emissions, power consumption, heat generation, differential fault analysis, and timing-based effects.  LADS augments standard cybersecurity approaches, which focus on digital effects, with analog techniques.  LADS will enable defenders to detect cyber attacks by sensing changes in the analog emissions of computing components, devices, and systems, greatly complicating the task of adversaries who wish to remain hidden.</r2:Description>

Brandeis will resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and being able to tap into the huge value of data.  In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that enable the controlled sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. government agencies.  Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders.  Brandeis technologies are being designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.</r2:Description>

DDoS attacks include both high-volume flooding attacks and more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while exhausting server processing and memory.  These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will conscript poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.  XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks.</r2:Description>

The CFAR program combined techniques for detecting differences across functionally replicated systems with novel variants that exhibit differences in behavior under cyber attack, so that CFAR-enabled computing systems can quickly detect deviations in processing elements at attack onset and rapidly reboot to restore affected services.

EdgeCT algorithms and software prototypes are implemented exclusively at the network edge, specifically on end hosts and/or on proxy servers fronting groups of such end hosts within a user enclave.  EdgeCT systems sense and respond rapidly to network failures and attacks by dynamically adapting protocols utilized to exchange packets among these hosts, thereby implementing fight-through strategies that restore networked communication.  This enables highly reliable networked communication for the military in the face of a wide variety of common network failure modes, as well as cyber attacks against network infrastructure.  EdgeCT technologies were developed in coordination with operational commands and commercial service providers.</r2:Description>

Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act.  The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Formerly Human-Machine Symbiosis (HMS) 

The Symbiotic Design program is developing artificial intelligence-based approaches to augment human teams in the design of cyber-physical systems (CPS), and thereby significantly reduce time to deployment.  The current generation of DoD systems and platforms integrate cyber and physical subsystems.  The capability of the engineering teams has not scaled with the enormous complexity of modern CPS.  Engineering organizations require large teams of engineers that collectively possess the necessary domain knowledge (of component technologies, theories, and tools), but the prolonged timelines of the development process for modern CPS hinders DoD's ability to counter emerging threats.  The Symbiotic Design program will address this challenge by transforming the human-focused, model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative discovery by humans and continuously-learning AI-based co-designers.  The program will create technologies essential for AI co-design, notably design space construction, design composition, and design space exploration.  The program will demonstrate the approach at realistic scales by a sequence of CPS design challenges of increasing complexity, and quantify the results with respect to development time, system performance, and innovation metrics.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety properties in uncertain environments.  Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification, and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments.  As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance.  Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.  The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments.</r2:Description>

At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in insufficient interpretations because alternatives are eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence.  AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from diverse media into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends.  AIDA aims to provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future.  AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions.  However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and address important national security challenge applications.  In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities.  If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies.  One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention.  Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and/or unanticipated situations.  Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models.  AAI application areas include the following:  (1) machine-enabled techniques to efficiently capture, generate, and analyze disparate data sources to accelerate design and development of new materials and chemistries for DoD specific applications; (2) knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture, analyze and reason with expertise, experience, and data to prevent loss and increase value of critical national security knowledge/expertise; and (3) social context informed AI approaches to enable reliable and robust forecasting and decision aiding tools for stabilization, deterrence and gray zone operations.</r2:Description>

The Automated Rapid Certification of Software (ARCOS) program is developing technologies that automate the evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to determine earlier in the process that system risks are acceptable. Current software certification practices do not scale with the amount of software being deployed by the DoD, so certification is becoming a bottleneck to new system deployment.  ARCOS technologies will address DoD software system certification time and cost.  ARCOS technology will automatically generate strong assurance arguments that incorporate supporting evidence for certification criteria.  ARCOS will also develop techniques to compose assurance arguments for pre-evaluated components into consolidated assurance arguments for new systems incorporating those components.</r2:Description>

For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society.  Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security.  The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators.  Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events.  KAIROS technologies aim to enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Stylized Language Processing (SLP) program will develop automated language processing techniques for sources that exhibit high degrees of domain-specific specialization. Natural language processing (NLP), a venerable sub-field of AI, has produced advanced but inexact capabilities for computers to process, translate, capture, transform, and utilize the information contained in the text and speech humans use for their everyday communications. Highly stylized language, for which standard NLP is dubitable, has been encountered in new language genres such as the language intrinsic to social media, for which style may be so heavy as to resemble a code. Importantly, stylized language in a constrained form is also characteristic of technical, legal, scientific, and other more formal sources encountered in specialized domains. Finally, the challenges that arise from language manifestations as influenced by culture, emotion, and media choice provide further motivation for language processing capabilities that exploit features of style. These cases challenge standard NLP but also offer opportunities for greater accuracy. The SLP program will develop language processing technologies for stylized language as it is used in specialized domains, new communication and social media, and by diverse cultures and populations. The techniques developed under the SLP program will be coordinated with DoD operators and applied to military application areas such as the engineering development of complex systems and intelligence analysis of foreign language information in cultural context.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program will create technologies and tools to support the development of viable and trusted system that include AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities.  Modern AI-dependent systems may include multiple AI components, drawing on a diverse set of AI-related techniques, ranging from machine learning (ML) to knowledge representation, search, planning, game theory, and optimization.  Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise.  To address this, EAISI researchers will develop abstractions, patterns, architectures, assurance techniques, and iterative processes that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components and associated training data.  One of the more difficult engineering challenges with AI is evaluation and assurance, since AI-based systems tend to resist traditional approaches to testing, inspection, and analysis.  It is not possible to fully test an AI-based system for every situation it will ever encounter, so new techniques are needed for verifying and validating AI-based systems.  EAISI aims to create software and systems engineering techniques, tools, and practices to facilitate the development of AI-based systems that are capable, trustworthy, affordable, and timely.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages.  The U.S. military operates globally, and frequently encounters low-resource languages, which are languages for which few linguists are available and automated human language technologies do not exist.  Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.  As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand.  LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources.  These are targeted capabilities that will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.</r2:Description>

Efforts to counter existing and emerging biological, chemical and radiological threats included: countermeasures to stop the pathophysiologic processes that occur as a consequence of an attack; collection of environmental trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological, chemical, and radiological sensors; and integrated defense systems.  This project also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The objective of the Defense Against Mass Terror Threats program is to identify and develop technologies that have the potential to significantly improve the United States' ability to reduce the risk of mass casualties in the wake of a Weapons of Mass Terror (WMT) attack.  Challenges in reducing U.S. vulnerability to these attacks include developing new sensors and systems that afford early warning and opportunities to interdict these threats before they can be employed in urban areas and other population centers.  A major goal of this program is to develop new sensors and sensing networks that can economically and reliably provide these wide-area monitoring capabilities for WMT threat signatures.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems.  The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology.

The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications.

The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. 

Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical and aerospace systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion, vehicle, and launch concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials and enabling technologies for aeronautic and aerospace system applications.

The Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open, media, and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to: 1) process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes and 2) counter the information operations of sophisticated adversaries who seek to deceive, degrade, deny, and disrupt the U.S. information enterprise.  Benefits sought include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon; an enhanced capability to plan, monitor, and control diverse military operations ranging from stabilization and information operations to combat engagements; and improvements to the efficiency of core military functions such as national and homeland security, warfighter health and readiness, and defense support of law enforcement and civil authorities.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long-range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target, kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new ship self-defense system.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations.  Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state of the art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention.  Starting in FY 2020, this program is also funded in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) program is developing and demonstrating new autonomous agents and techniques that can rapidly discriminate hostile intent and filter out threats during missions ranging from minutes to hours, leveraging natural or created stimuli to elicit behavioral responses among humans in an area.  The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact.  Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior.  This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA is exploring scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent.  This mission requires the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments.  URSA is developing new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat.  It is implementing new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and building a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force.</r2:Description>

The core objective of the SubT Challenge is to discover the solution(s) which best outperforms current approaches for manually and laboriously mapping and searching subterranean environments.  Newly developed capabilities will span across four technology focus areas in autonomy, perception, networking, and mobility technologies.  The program will increase the diversity, versatility, and robustness of relevant system technologies, capable of addressing the multi-faceted needs of a wide range of environments.  Innovations are being explored in the context of a public-facing, broadly inclusive DARPA Challenge.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Urban combat demands that riflemen also serve as combat engineers manipulating their local environment to gain tactical advantage.  The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment.  Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability.  The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research.  Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment.  The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties.  The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use.</r2:Description>

Novel approaches are needed that are absolutely effective from the air or ground against several scales of primarily urban, concealed threats while not being catastrophically destructive.  Current approaches to identifying, engaging, and assessing effects against evasive ground targets in complex terrain requires significant human oversight combined with human semantic reasoning tied to rules of execution, resulting in slow and methodical engagements.  Proportional weapons will develop next generation effects for ground systems that provides extended range and tunable effects with greatly minimized impact to a warfighter operator.  Proposed technical approaches will be scalable for application to dismounted warfighters, vehicle-borne (air and ground) systems, or as human-in-the-loop payloads for future autonomous platforms.</r2:Description>

The Sustained Combat Operations in Undefined Terrain (SCOUT) program will explore an integrated system to aid ground troops in understanding and shaping the battlefield environment before, during, and after tactical operations.  SCOUT will develop ground robotic platforms with enhanced, all-terrain mobility, extended endurance, and novel movement techniques to increase platform survivability and reduce detection.  This capability will enable long-duration pre-mission reconnaissance, extending the timeline of current human scouts by 5-10x, and will support continuous patrolling or tactical resupply during sustainment operations.  SCOUT is envisioned to host mission payloads that will integrate with other heterogeneous sensors, such as soldier-borne, vehicle-borne, weapon status indicators, and manned or unmanned ground/air assets, to form a complete picture of an area of interest.  This will enable new, networked capabilities at the tactical level, such as automatic generation of reports populated with event, location, and status of forces, both manned and unmanned, to support response.  SCOUT developed systems will provide mobility and extended endurance to enable increased payload access and information to pro-actively stage forces, enable on-demand resupply, or rapidly call for fires in support of timely operations.  The confluence of mobility, endurance, and survivability developed under the SCOUT program will push the state of the art in unmanned ground systems and support on-the-fly battlefield management, providing an asymmetric advantage to U.S. forces.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not realized at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level.  The goal of the Squad X program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  Squad X is exploring advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities.  The end result of the Squad X program is an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move.  By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program is emphasizing low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems.  Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program is developing solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.</r2:Description>

The program will design, build, and flight test an aircraft that is able to fly and maneuver at altitude relying on state of the art Active Flow Control (AFC) technology.  AFC is a broad term that encompasses a range of technology approaches; broadly defined, it is a control mechanism which alters the aerodynamic flow field thru ejection or suction of fluid via an orifice on a lifting body.  An emphasis of the program will be on assessing AFC component technologies, risk reduction and experimentation, integrated testing, fabrication and demonstration of a relevant scale novel and innovative aircraft.  Technologies, design tools and models developed and demonstrated under this program will be made available to all Services as well as the civilian aerospace sector for application to future air systems development.</r2:Description>

These adversary systems will likely employ advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques which will inevitably lead to increased complexity and unpredictability of these advanced threats.  CounterSwarmAI envisions the development of disruptive technologies across the engagement kill chain, themselves AI-empowered, which directly combat these challenges.  CounterSwarmAI decision software will directly interface with future and legacy defensive systems (kinetic and non-kinetic) to rapidly assess, optimally exploit, and efficiently defeat enemy autonomous systems threats.  Innovative solutions will enable (a) autonomous systems which provide understanding and vulnerability exploitation through machine learning, (b) an integrated AI-equipped open architecture for multi-faceted swarm defense, and (c) integration and experimentation with live surrogate swarm threats against current fielded defensive systems.</r2:Description>

The system will develop novel sensing and detection techniques to detect and locate HEL signatures before and during HEL firing during day/night conditions and will leverage material advances for protective coatings to improve warfighter endurance during HEL attacks.  Potential detection modalities include low-light scattering detection of high-energy laser systems and coherent detection.  CONOPS, protective materials, and obscurants will be evaluated for potential improvements to survivability of systems targeted by HEL weapons.  Many elements of HEL systems are vulnerable, and HEL defeat systems may include kinetic and optical approaches.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program designed, developed, and demonstrated a kit enabling affordable, rapid automation of selected aircrew functions across a broad range of aircraft.  ALIAS enabled reduction of aircrew workload and/or the number of on-board aircrew to improve performance.  The program developed hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program also developed tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS leveraged recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS culminated in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability enables new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allows a reduction in the number of aircrew required.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) program will assist military decision makers with rapidly identifying and selecting options for tasking and re-tasking assets within and across organizational boundaries.  Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets.  Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations.  ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers.  The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.  Technology developed under this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

WMT pathways consist of networks or links among individuals, groups, organizations, and other entities that act to promote or enable the development, procurement, possession, transportation, or proliferation of WMTs and related capabilities.  Monitoring and controlling WMT pathways is essential to denying access to WMT technology, knowledge, materials, expertise, and weapons.  MAA will create graph models reflecting prototypical WMT pathways, develop methods for creating merged activity graphs by aligning entities across multiple intelligence modalities, develop algorithms to match empirical activity graphs with pathway models, and create synthetic data sets at scale to support development and testing of WMT activity detection techniques.  MAA technology development is being coordinated with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes and phenomena.  The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by analysis of sensor and open source data.  The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited by a shortage of expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning.  D3M is addressing this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models.  D3M technologies include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts.  D3M is focused on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC.</r2:Description>

The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholder groups on civil, economic, and military matters.  These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities, and concerns that may differ significantly.  Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties.  This program will develop tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors.  These tools will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.</r2:Description>

Statistical detection techniques have been successful, but media generation and manipulation technology is advancing rapidly, and purely statistical detection methods are now insufficient.  Existing media generation and manipulation algorithms are data driven and are prone to making semantic errors that provide defenders an opportunity for asymmetric advantage.  SemaFor will create semantic and statistical analysis algorithms that determine if media is generated or manipulated; attribution algorithms that infer if media originates from a particular organization or individual; and characterization algorithms that reason about whether media was generated or manipulated for malicious purposes.  SemaFor aims to create technologies to identify, deter, and understand adversary disinformation campaigns.</r2:Description>

The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors onboard a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The DBM program developed a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture enabled rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintained a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program incorporated highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-in-the-loop operator approval.  DBM technologies transitioned to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Materials and Biological Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop materials and biological technologies that make possible a wide range of new military capabilities.

The major goal of the Materials Processing Technology project is to develop novel materials, fabrication and processing techniques, models, devices and components that will lower the cost, increase the performance, and/or enable new missions for military platforms and systems.  Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of technology areas including manufacturing, electronics, sensors, optics, and complex and autonomous systems.

The Biologically Based Materials and Devices project will leverage the growing application space of the biological sciences for the development of new DoD capabilities in materials development, threat detection, and warfighter performance.  Contained in this project are thrusts that apply biology's unique synthesis capabilities to source DoD-relevant materials and overcome current limitations in accessing, scaling, and distributing critical resources to achieve overmatch.  Programs in this project also enable in situ and stand-off detection and mitigation of biological, chemical, traditional, and emerging threats against the warfighter, the food supply, and other targets.  This project also includes efforts to develop novel biological technologies for maintaining human combat performance.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Multi-Scale Modeling thrust is developing advanced, multi-physics models that can predict the effect of disturbances and/or perturbations in the space environment in order to inform operational decisions based on current space environment conditions.  Current space environment models are limited to predicting long term climatic averages or regularly occurring phenomena and do not fully account for coupling effects where perturbations in one region of the space environment may produce disturbances in another region.  Approaches for addressing these limitations under the Multi-Scale Modeling thrust include the following:  (1) development of observation driven/first-principles theory of magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling; (2) creation of an extensible assimilation framework for unifying space environment monitoring systems and data; and (3) non-traditional space environment measurement approaches.  These developments will ensure the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of space weather models and is sufficient to enable prediction of operationally relevant perturbations and disturbances in the space environment.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Functional Materials and Devices thrust is developing advanced materials, components and systems to improve device performance for DoD sensing, imaging and communication applications.  One focus of this thrust involves development of advanced transductional materials that convert one form of energy to another for DoD-relevant applications in areas such as thermoelectrics.  While promising transduction materials are known for a variety of applications, integration into devices has not been realized.  Another focus area is the development of physics based models that predict material behavior when illuminated by high peak power electromagnetic interference.  A third focus area involves development of new multi-functional materials and device designs that will radically decrease the size, weight and power requirements of neutron and gamma sources for high-resolution neutron, gamma and x-ray imaging.  Such devices should enable fieldable detection units for non-destructive evaluation of parts, detection of explosives and other DoD-relevant targets.</r2:Description>

The Materials for Extreme Environments thrust is exploring new materials, materials architectures, and materials development processes that will significantly enhance the performance and persistence of DoD platforms operating in extremely harsh environments.  Materials with superior strength, functionality, and resiliency are critical for enabling DoD platforms, weapons and other components to operate and persist under conditions including, but not limited to, extremely high or low temperatures, turbulence, ionizing radiation, and/or corrosive environments.  Recent developments in materials such as architected materials, high entropy alloys, and carbon fiber composites hold promise for achieving material solutions for improved survivability in a wide range of harsh environment conditions.  Similarly, advancements in material design, processing and manufacturing are enabling novel material architectures that can further enhance performance and resilience in structures such as leading edges, windows and apertures, propulsion systems, and space structures.  Building on technologies developed under the Materials Processing and Manufacturing program, also in this Program Element, exemplar areas of research within the Materials for Extreme Environments thrust include the following:  1) high temperature materials for hypersonic platforms; 2) high temperature window and aperture materials; 3) radiation and/or electromagnetic pulse (EMP) hardened electronics for space platforms; and 4) coatings for platform survivability in corrosive environments.</r2:Description>

This includes development of capabilities across sensing, perception, planning and control for autonomous, high-speed operation in cluttered environments without Global Positioning System (GPS) information.  This also includes development of capabilities to manipulate and control adversary sensory perception and/or situational awareness.  Additional work in this thrust focuses on how sensing systems and military systems-of-systems are designed for real-time resilient response to dynamic, unexpected signals and contingencies.  Research is developing a more unified view of system behavior that allows better understanding and exploitation of complex interactions among components, including development of formal mathematical approaches to complex adaptive system composition and design.  These capabilities will impact autonomous systems and systems-of-systems, including those that involve humans, in a variety of DoD-relevant contexts.</r2:Description>

This program will develop new technologies to control and manipulate the microbiome (e.g., to reduce attraction and feeding of disease vectors such as mosquitoes).  Current state-of-the-art approaches are focused on metagenomics to inventory and categorize the microbes in a given sample. In order to have more precise and on-demand control of microbiomes, technologies will be developed to elucidate the complex interactions between the microorganisms and their host as well as the interactions between consortia of adapted and evolved microorganisms.  Advances in this area will both develop novel technologies to interrogate complex microbial communities in human systems and discover ways to beneficially harness microbiomes to expand warfighter resiliency.</r2:Description>

Active duty military personnel face increased risk of acute and chronic neuropsychiatric dysfunction, limiting day-to-day function and return to duty.  Current therapeutic approaches for many neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD], mood disorders, and substance abuse) rely on individual management with integrated psychiatric therapy and medication.  However, most interventions approved for use in these conditions lack long-term efficacy, involve a logistical burden of treatment and/or carry a risk of serious adverse side effects.  The Restoring Cognitive Capability program will develop and test novel drug chemotypes designed to functionally interact with neuronal receptor subtypes known to play a role in these neuropsychiatric conditions, with the aim of enabling fast-acting and effective alleviation of neuropsychiatric dysfunction with single or minimal doses.</r2:Description>

Current methods of CB protection require significant logistical burdens, including suits that are bulky and hot, which limit operational capability. These burdens increase if an increased level of protection is required. The Unburdening the Warfighter from CB Defense program will investigate and design novel biological and material approaches that provide rapid protection against multiple agents for the warfighter. This research will innovate PPE through the discovery of compounds and lightweight, durable systems designed to capture, neutralize, or repel CB agents. This novel approach will provide almost immediate and lasting protection even in austere operational settings.</r2:Description>

Currently, the DoD relies on purification of existing water sources and/or distribution of bottled or treated water to provide the warfighter with sufficient daily hydration. This program will develop the technology to provide potable water on-site without the need for an external water supply and will do so with size, weight, power, and water output requirements tailored to the needs of the individual warfighter, as well as larger groups (e.g., Humanitarian and Disaster Relief [HADR] missions). The ability to liberate the warfighter from the water supply chain through the technology developed by this program will provide strategic and tactical advantages aligned with the DoD shift to more distributed and self-sustaining forces.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Living Foundries program was to create a revolutionary, biologically based manufacturing platform for the DoD and the Nation.  With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments, and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  Living Foundries sought to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that could be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aimed to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.
 
Research thrusts focused on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result was an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabled the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Success was predicated on tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation would be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms were challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (those tolerant of harsh environments).</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program developed platform technologies to interrogate and define the biological pathways to enhance operational readiness for DoD personnel.  This program aided the warfighter by improving immune response, minimizing inflammation, and restoring critical organ function.  One approach to achieve this capability required the development of new tools to stimulate and measure responses of the nervous system in order to harness the bioelectric code, enabling targeted therapy without the need for pharmacological products, ultimately reducing logistical requirements.  An additional approach involved characterizing the host response in patients with severe infections, which provides a quantitative framework to guide therapy.  Algorithms were developed to evaluate and predict various physiological conditions for military personnel.  Advances made under the Adaptive Immunomodulation-Based Therapeutics program will offer new avenues for treating disease or organ function to improve force readiness.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.

Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.

The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging.  Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.  These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields.  In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and ultralow frequency communications.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program aims to develop intrinsically linear (ideal) radio frequency (RF) transistors with improved power efficiency and extremely high dynamic range.  Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs.  The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power.</r2:Description>

To achieve this goal, SHRIMP conducted foundational research in the area of micro-actuator materials and energy efficient power systems for extremely size, weight, and power constrained microrobotic systems.  The program's platform development activities will leverage recent advances in low power, application specific integrated circuit electronics and low power sensors from the internet of things community to increase the functionality of microrobotic platforms while increasing platform mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity. The microrobotic platform capabilities enabled by SHRIMP will provide the DoD with significantly more access and capability to operate in small spaces that are practically inaccessible to today's state-of-the-art robotic platforms.  Such capability will have impact in search and rescue, disaster relief, infrastructure inspection, and equipment maintenance, among other operations.

The Focal Arrays for Curved Infrared Imagers (FOCII) program will add curved focal plane arrays to broadband infrared (IR) imagers to enhance battlefield detection and discrimination while maintaining situational awareness.  The resulting desired capability is analogous to human vision that enables wide fields of view in a compact optical system package.  Currently fielded imaging systems are flat broadband infrared sensors that rely on large and complex optics to correct aberrations and improve illumination and resolution.  FOCII will (1) leverage curving strategies for state of the art focal plane arrays combined with advances in designing and manufacturing stress relief features to demonstrate hardware that simultaneously provides maximum resolution and illumination, and (2) develop novel designs for IR imagers that enable minimal size, weight and cost for size-constrained applications.  This will enable new applications in passive seeker technology for missiles, overhead persistent infrared imaging, 360 degree situational awareness, infrared search and track, and long range targeting.</r2:Description>

The Wideband Adaptive RF Protection (WARP) program will develop radio frequency (RF) front-end technology that can protect wideband digital radios against external electromagnetic threats and self-interference, through tunable filtering, limiting, and/or signal cancellation. Today's advanced wideband DoD systems, such as multi-function phased arrays, are open to all frequencies by design with little or no RF filtering.  This is due to a lack of tunable and reconfigurable filters that are small enough to integrate into the arrays, limiting the use of wideband multi-function arrays in contested environments.  The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important for implementing transmit/receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays.  Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference.  Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to receive and perform signal intelligence functions while simultaneously transmitting a high-power jamming self-protect signal.  WARP will develop the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted jamming signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected.  Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self-induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP will develop intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers.</r2:Description>

Magnetometers and electrometers are widely used within the DoD and industry. The medical community utilizes sensitive magnetometers for magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography. In addition to being diagnostically relevant, such sensitive magnetometers could enable future human-machine/brain-machine interfaces. The DoD and industry also uses magnetometers for magnetic anomaly detection, which may allow for the discovery of mineral/oil deposits, discovery of old wellheads, or the detection of improvised explosive devices. In addition, magnetometers offer the possibility of magnetic navigation, which may operate in GPS-denied environments. High sensitivity electrometers are used by industry to locate live current and static electricity sources.  Recent developments have resulted in the potential to develop highly sensitive vector electrometers and magnetometers, which would enable the consequent development of sensitive full tensor gradient sensors. Such tensors offer more degrees of freedom than their scalar or vector counterparts and potentially provide additional information about the source.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High Operating Temperature Sensors for Hypersonics and Turbine Engines (HOTSHOT) program seeks to enable electronics and sensing in harsh temperature environments for next generation vehicles.  Currently, sensing systems are not robust to the temperature extremes expected over a mission lifetime. This technology gap hampers the ability to capture flight test data from air vehicles (boost glide, air-breathing, etc.) during development.  HOTSHOT will develop the material, device, and sensor technologies required to create high-temperature capable sensing systems.  These new material choices allow transduction, signal conditioning, digitization, and processing at elevated temperatures, thus reducing the need for temperature shielding of these components.  Reduced shielding drops the on-vehicle size, weight, and power requirements for many components.  HOTSHOT will enable faster and more predictable design of new air vehicles, which will lead to more efficient system performance.</r2:Description>

The program plans to provide strong privacy protections at the tactical edge with no more than one order of magnitude penalty in computation time and enable very strong privacy at the enterprise level with no more than three orders of magnitude penalty over unencrypted processing. The DoD is increasingly reliant on cloud computing services and storage. Cloud-enabled virtualized storage and the accompanying virtualized computing play a key role in data processing for planning and operations. Networks are also becoming more virtualized spaces, such as in 5G systems. The growing virtualization storage, computing, and networking puts data privacy of all users at risk. DPRIVE will build hardware to accelerate the computation of homomorphic encryption, which enables mathematical operations to execute on encrypted data such that the data is never unencrypted. The program will enable the development and deployment of these hardware accelerators to edge computing devices where power and time are a premium as well as enterprise computing facilities where the amount and sensitivity of the data requires increased protection.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact radio frequency signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems.  HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.   Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program is developing inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2022, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop advanced inertial MEMS sensors that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  Basic research for this program was funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands.  These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program is developing extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations.  Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.  However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.  Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).  The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions at lower performance.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur.  These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Materials program is demonstrating the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components.  Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program is pursuing potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, "sticky logic" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  Further research will support innovation in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs focused on DoD-relevant businesses.  The program is demonstrating the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.  Basic research for this program is funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-02.</r2:Description>

CHIPS is pursuing standardized interfaces for integrating a variety of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks in the form of prefabricated chiplets.  The chiplets could be reused across applications, manufacturers, and transistor types, allowing DoD to amortize IC design costs across programs, better align electronics design and fabrication with military performance goals, and expand beyond its traditional reliance on the proprietary capabilities of a few on-shore manufacturers.</r2:Description>

When developing operationally significant intelligence, human analysts today are forced to reduce the scope of the problems that they can address and the tempo of their analyses due to the limitations of currently deployed hardware.  Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE is leveraging improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program is investigating advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.  This program will enable the warfighter to understand far more of the battlespace in real time.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Digital RF Battlespace Emulator (DRBE) program is developing a large-scale, interactive, emulated radiofrequency (RF) environment, providing the DoD with much needed capability to cost-effectively evaluate adaptive, intelligent, and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems.  Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems.  Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap.  Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data.  To overcome these limitations, DRBE is leveraging advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems.  The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands.  DRBE is pursuing three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling.  The resulting test environment will allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test.  Multi-system exercises will then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE is serving to develop concept of operations (CONOPS), inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems.</r2:Description>

The Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon (AISS) program will enable a design tool and Intellectual Property (IP) ecosystem where security is pervasive and can be naturally incorporated into chip design with minimal effort and expense. The program will enable rapid evaluation of architectural alternatives in platform integration where security is considered with conventional design economics, together being power, area, speed, and security. The program will advance multi-level provenance and integrity validation techniques for design through advances in current methods or invention of novel technical approaches and demonstrate new capabilities in the context of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures or computer processors.  AISS aims to automate inclusion of scalable defense mechanisms into chip designs to enable optimization of the security versus economics trade space. It will protect advanced chips from known attack strategies by incorporating security into a highly automated system aimed at reducing design time while maximizing exploration of architectural alternatives.  As a result, the DoD applications will benefit from more secure chips becoming pervasive whether designed specifically for the defense systems or commercially procured.</r2:Description>

The goal of the Guaranteed Architectures for Physical Security (GAPS) program is to develop hardware security and software architectures with provable security interfaces. These interfaces will physically isolate high risk transactions during both system design and system build and track that such protections are enforced at run-time. GAPS will reduce the inherent complexity through the development of hardware and software that will be open, extendible, and compatible with size, weight, and power constrained environments to enable security across DoD and commercial systems.  The program will substantially lower the barrier to safely enabling high-risk transactions, thus allowing for: a) fast computer-to-computer transactions; b) physical spatial isolation reducing the need for unreliable software partitioning solutions; and c) more complex missions without putting sensitive data at risk.</r2:Description>

The Lasers for Universal Microscale Optical Systems (LUMOS) program will integrate high performance light sources into integrated silicon photonics to enable compact, rugged, high-performance systems for positioning, navigation, communications, 3D imaging, and quantum technologies. Silicon photonics today enables microscale integration of complex optical systems, but the platform's lack of optical gain precludes the creation of lasers and amplifiers through foundry processes. LUMOS will deliver the missing capability to provide compact optical sources at wavelengths from the visible to the infrared, and will create a universal manufacturing platform that builds upon the current photonics ecosystem. To drive innovation and maintain DoD access to leading-edge deployable photonic solutions, LUMOS will establish a technology pathway connecting government, academic, commercial, and defense users of integrated photonics, and will provide multi-project wafer runs through an open-access foundry.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies.  Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH is driving new research in electronics hardware security and exploiting current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program is also investigating flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH is mitigating the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems.</r2:Description>

Rapid prototyping and experimentation of integrated system concepts, as well as enabling vehicle subsystems will be conducted.  Programs will explore new architectural concepts that employ a mix of weapon technologies that achieve lethality through a combination of overwhelming performance and overwhelming numbers rather than through the use of singular and costly high value assets.  Studies conducted under this program element include examination and evaluation of emerging aerospace threats, technologies, concepts, use of autonomy to minimize risk, and applications for missiles, munitions, and vehicle systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

The program will also consider traceability, compatibility, and integration with the Navy Vertical Launch System (VLS).  The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.  TBG capabilities are planned for transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Advanced Full Range Engine (AFRE) program will establish the feasibility of a hypersonic aircraft reusable propulsion system through a two-pronged approach.  AFRE will demonstrate turbine to Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ) transition of a Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) propulsion system utilizing an off-the-shelf turbine engine.  Large scale components of this complex propulsion system will be developed and demonstrated independently; to be followed by a full-scale freejet TBCC propulsion system mode transition ground test.  Accomplishing these objectives will enable future airfield-based hypersonic systems to operate without special logistics considerations, resulting in transformational changes in long range strike, high speed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) operations.  The anticipated transition partner for this effort is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

This program seeks to develop an advanced booster capable of delivering a variety of payloads at a variety of ranges.  Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonics to achieve these objectives.  The transition partner is the Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Air-Ground Autonomous VEhicles (AGAVE) program will explore the seams between air and ground vehicles.  New approaches are required to address one of the most symmetric of all warfighting domains - ground combat.  The program will seek to provide improved mobility solutions for supporting combat operations that place unmanned assets forward to explore and inform troops prior to entering an area, or to provide continued perimeter and overhead surveillance during operations.  Technologies will be explored to allow increased levels of autonomy, improved operating ranges, improved mobility through complex 3-dimensional battlespaces, and integration of the requirements for both ground and air mobility in complex urban warfare settings.  Reduced manning requirements will be a part of the design space evaluation, with unmanned vehicles operating in a supporting role instead of a traditional supported role.  Novel approaches to multi-modal platforms, platform states, and manned-unmanned teaming that reduce the need for highly trained personnel dedicated to monitoring unmanned vehicles will be explored.  Problems that cross all domains, such as high energy density power supplies, navigation through uncertain and changing environments, and supervisory autonomy of vehicles will be addressed.  Novel networking and teaming approaches to achieve tactical tasks will also be explored to close the seams between ground and air unmanned vehicles and to improve confidence in identifying risks associated with both natural hazards and enemy actions prior to ground personnel entering an area.  Cueing from other assets and long range, long duration autonomous assets will be included in the overall tradespace explored.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the LongShot program is to develop and flight demonstrate a weapon system using multi-mode propulsion that significantly increases engagement range and weapon effectiveness against adversary air threats.  LongShot will explore new engagement concepts for multi-modal, multi-kill systems that can engage more than one target.  LongShot can be deployed either externally from existing fighters or internally from existing bombers.  An air system using multi-modal propulsion could capitalize upon a slower speed, higher fuel-efficient air vehicle for ingress, while retaining highly energetic air-to-air missiles for endgame target engagements.  This approach provides several key benefits, which ultimately increase weapon effectiveness.  First, the weapon system will have a much-increased range over their legacy counterparts for transit to an engagement zone.  Second, launching air-to-air missiles closer to the adversary increases energy in terminal flight, reduces reaction time, and increases probability of kill.  The program will also evaluate other applications of multi-mode propulsion.  Potential transition partners include the Navy and Air Force.</r2:Description>

This system will utilize the high maneuverability of a missile system coupled with a gun system capable of scalable effects and engagement of multiple targets.  These mission sets addressed will include counter insurgency (COIN) operations, close air support (CAS) and air-to-air engagements.  The metrics associated with this system include total range (which includes transit to target, loiter and engagement) and weapon system effectiveness.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a robust missile system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic, propulsion, and payload capacity for a wide operational envelope, (2) the algorithms that support maneuvering and target recognition to enable expedited command decision making for selecting and engaging targets and (3) approaches to incorporating modularity of design to reduce cost throughout the design and development process.

Collaboration of multiple assets offered new possibilities to conduct military missions using smaller air platforms to enhance survivability, reduce overall acquisition cost, create new effects, increase communications range and robustness in denied environments, increase search area, increase areas held at risk, reduce target prosecution reaction time, and provide multi-mission capabilities by combinations of assets.  This effort focused on developing and demonstrating approaches that will expand the mission capabilities of legacy air assets through autonomy and collaborative behaviors, within a standard based open architecture.  CODE transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Aircraft and Vehicle IntegrAted Team (AVIATE) program studied the use of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that is an integrated subsystem of a ground vehicle with features to autonomously land, attach, stow, detach, and take-off from its parent ground vehicle while it is on the move to enable on-demand capabilities and drastically improved protection.  Ground vehicles could perform traditional UAS missions such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and fires support, as well as unique missions such as electronic attack, sensor emplacement, infrastructure attack, and active protection without having to rely on brigade and theater level assets.  This effort explored design interfaces between the air and ground vehicle, attributes to allow for launch and recovery on the move, and design considerations to enable operations in contested environments.</r2:Description>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions.

A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets.  This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced/maintained.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.

Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems.  Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The goal of the Experimental Spaceplane (XSP) program is to design a scalable, responsive, prototype reusable launch system capable of inserting commercially and militarily relevant payloads (greater than 3000 lbs.) into low earth orbit and suborbital trajectories.  There is a $5M cost goal to drive down the expense of space access by an order of magnitude versus traditional expendable launch vehicles.  This is accomplished by designing for high velocity staging which dramatically reduces the amount of costly expendable hardware.  The ability to fly 10 times in 10 days and designing the system to launch a payload into orbit within 24 hours traces to the responsiveness necessary in a military system.  The system will be designed to fly greater than Mach 6.5 multiple times, which directly translates to a reusable hypersonic capability.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), providing persistence and enabling ground station antennas to point in a fixed direction.  Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to provide robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.  To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Planar Imager program seeks to disrupt the state-of-the-art in optical sensors by developing a lightweight, compact, affordable optical payload that can be integrated into a ride-share compatible satellite bus with equivalent imaging performance to current commercial conventional optical imaging satellites.  This technology will significantly lower the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of high-resolution intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites enabling persistent coverage by an affordable satellite constellation and with a rapid reconstitution ability.  To achieve this goal, Planar Imager will exploit recent developments in materials science and nanofabrication by maturing small-scale ultra-thin optics demonstrated in the laboratory to meter-scale and demonstrate a proof-of-concept optical system in space.  The reduction in optical payload SWAP-C will disrupt the paradigm of costly custom large meter-scale aperture ISR satellites on dedicated launches to satellites with high-performance ISR systems that are ride-share compatible.  These compact optical payloads will enable a large number of meter-scale aperture ISR satellites packed into a single launch vehicle fairing, dramatically reducing launch costs as well.  A more persistent and pervasive space-based ISR architecture will increase warfighter readiness and lethality.  These planar optics will also have applications to any optical imaging system and will impact all areas of optical remote sensing and imaging as well as any system that requires optical components including laser systems.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

The Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program will develop and demonstrate a High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) system.  The capability afforded by NTP will expand the operating presence of the U.S. in space to the cislunar volume and enhance domestic operations to a new high-ground, which is in danger of being defined by the adversary.  The program will initially develop the use of additive manufacturing (AM) approaches to print NTP fuel elements.  This program will be the first demonstration of AM printing of uranium fuel elements.  The results will be used to enable optimized NTP reactor designs that are not constrained by traditional manufacturing.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Advances in technology, including networking and computing, have significantly increased the utility of small (&lt;300kg) spacecraft that would previously have been of limited military value.  For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today.  The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure.  This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today.  Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space, which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs.  The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure.  To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site.  The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Hallmark program demonstrated a space Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) development capability to provide U.S. senior leadership the tools needed to effectively manage space assets in real time.  The program enabled the rapid development of command and control decision support tools for the full-spectrum of space operations, management, and control, from peace to potential conflict.  Hallmark demonstrated the ability to increase space threat awareness via use of multi-data fusion and to protect against threats by using modeling and simulation tools to develop courses of action for both natural events and adversary actions.  The program employed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to increase commander and operator awareness, thereby transforming information to knowledge and effectively communicating and facilitating time-critical decision making.  The Hallmark BMC2 layer was underpinned by an innovative, flexible infrastructure that enables the agile development and integration of tools in an accelerated, operationally relevant time fame, in order to respond to shifting adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Advanced Electronics Technologies Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, integrated photonic-electronic components that have military applications and potential commercial utility. Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.

The Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of components for laser weapon systems that will protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) optical communications systems that rely on no moving parts enabling their use on SWaP-restricted platforms.  Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements.

The Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies Project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Funding under this project will include developing new technologies and capabilities in commercial settings, establishing access to these new processes and commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundries, developing manufacturable processes for integrated photonics, new architectures and integration technologies for advanced field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and innovating back end of line technologies for wide bandgap semiconductors.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC.  Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs will enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army.</r2:Description>

WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and are vulnerable to interference and jamming. WiSPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, electronic warfare (EW) communications deception, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power limitations of future command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The program will develop an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and featureless waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link.  Technologies developed under the WiSPER program are planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>To enable advanced communications and improve network resiliency, the Portable Optical Integrated Network Transceivers (POINT) program aims to develop low size, weight, and power (SWaP) photonic transceivers and demonstrate them in free-space optical (FSO) links for micro-satellites and small mobile platforms. The high-SWaP of existing optical terminals with gimbals and telescopes are incompatible with micro-satellite payload capacity and mission requirements. POINT will leverage recent development of optical phased array based transmitter technology combined with wide field of view, dual-mode, high-speed imaging receivers. The integrated optical transceivers will have no moving parts, resulting in a radical reduction in SWaP, enabling advanced and resilient communications for small Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and other mobile platforms. The program will develop and demonstrate an FSO link applicable to LEO-LEO or LEO-Ground missions, providing high bandwidth, efficient, and secure communication links for resilient command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in space. Other terrestrial uses of the technology include interference-free operation in denied environments and low probability of intercept/low probability of detection tactical links.  Technologies developed under the POINT program are planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program is developing inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments.  These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program exploits recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM is focusing on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances will enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.  This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program is building an immersive electromagnetic environment for use by the warfighter to understand the effects of electronic maneuvers and developing new electronic maneuver warfare (EMW) techniques. The program is leveraging recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for EMW techniques. Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmable RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. It accomplishes complementary goals of working in a commercial environment for innovation beyond-SOTA to develop electronics for military capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening our domestic ecosystem and ensuring that the DoD has enduring access to SOTA technologies.  Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge silicon foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. This program will forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing design capabilities for advanced digital logic in SOTA foundries, developing new architectures for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using commercial manufacturing flows, and lowering the technical hurdles for ubiquitous heterogeneous integration by revolutionizing back end compound semiconductor processes. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) program is developing a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming.  Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance compound semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition through commercial industry to the Services.</r2:Description>

The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program aims to develop optical signaling technologies for digital microelectronics. Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal-scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input/output (I/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and FPGAs, widely used in advanced DoD sensors and RF systems. The goal of the program is improving I/O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by >100x to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual-use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to larger scale commercial performers and the Services.</r2:Description>

The Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) program will develop an on-shore ultra-broadband radio frequency (RF) mixed-mode semiconductor integrated circuits foundry platform for the critical interface to convert high speed analog signals to a digital representation for commercial and military systems. The mixed-mode circuits take signals from the physical world (analog, RF) and transform them to be processed in computing systems (digital). As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies to carry faster data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitries with high speed digital processing logics onto one integrated chip is needed to attain the performance required for future systems. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G/6G applications. The goal of T-MUSIC technology is to enable wireless operations beyond 100 GHz with very wide bandwidth with low noise and high dynamic range. In parallel, T-MUSIC aims to develop the next-generation terahertz (THz) mixed-mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on-shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed-mode System-on-Chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications.</r2:Description>

SHARE will provide the level of security provided by today's communications systems, while managing trust at the tactical edge, and provide new opportunities for U.S. and coalition forces to gain and maintain a tactical advantage on the battlefield.  Coordination includes providing all the information required to enable the command and control necessary to plan and execute operations in all phases of warfare.  Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies that work with coalition partners.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters and features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations.  The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program will develop technology to access and analyze global-scale, multimodal geospatial data and pilot an analytics-as-a-service business model.  Exploiting multiple sources and modalities at a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services, including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums.  GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains.  By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities for DoD military mission planning and execution.  It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby will improve speed, agility, and scalability.  Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link.  This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades.  In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established.  During these network outages, data transmission is not possible.  The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments.  Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.  The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links.  The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons.  These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command.  The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries.  This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.  The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation.  PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).  The PFC program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The tools will manage information flow to support data correlation and fusion across multiple, isolated databases and networks. Technology advances are making it possible to pass messages across heterogeneous waveforms and networks, but there are no technologies today that can determine if it is the data that is most important to end users and systems.  Building upon technologies developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical edge (SHARE) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), MDA will combine network management with data analytics, information exploitation and fusion technology to route information in an understandable context, based upon information need and value.  MDA also seeks to address multi-level security configuration issues that often add delays and limit interoperability. The MDA program will enable automated data analysis across different networks without manually moving impracticably large amounts of data. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

This capability will support the simultaneous operations and airspace deconfliction of a wide array of airborne systems, such as manned and unmanned weapons systems and non-combatant aircraft.  Based on technologies developed in the Systems of Systems-Enhanced Small Units (SESU) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E/Project NET-01), Dynamic Airspace Control will consist of an artificial intelligence engine and a mix of traditional and non-traditional sensors to create the air picture.  It will also leverage legacy Airspace management tools to take advantage of prior investments in technologies, such as human-machine interfaces, and to minimize the impact on training.  The artificial intelligence engine will generate a real-world model enabling automated airspace deconfliction for a variety of simultaneous missions (e.g., helicopter search and rescue, fires, and surveillance with unmanned airborne vehicles). The program will use traditional and non-traditional sensors, such as flight plans, air platform self-reporting, and passive sensing in order to confirm flight plans or to detect unidentified air platforms in the airspace.

RNDMC plans to use a combination of synchronized repeaters and tactical radios to enhance desired signals and reject intentional and unintentional interference.  Based on technologies developed in the Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), RNDMC will design, develop, and demonstrate a distributed field of expendable transceivers, providing a robust, low-cost, BLOS tactical communications system that degrades gracefully as repeater nodes become unavailable. The ultimate RNDMC goal is a demonstration on ground and air platforms and will not be reliant on Global Positioning System (GPS).

                                                    <r2:Description>The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications.  The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program was to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems.  The program leveraged technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach included exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal was to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program transitioned to the Army.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The proliferation of video, voice, chat, and other important data-streams on the battlefield has driven a need for higher capacity, reliable, assured, and all-weather communications that are deployable on a wide range of air, ground, and maritime platforms.  The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program was to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that could meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking capacity needs of deployed military forces.  The primary focus of the program was a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution to provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency.  The program developed the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system.  Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Air Force.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts.  It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.

The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.

The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

                                            <r2:ProjectMissionDescription>The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments.  Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.</r2:Description>

PROTEUS will provide the tools and automation to enable small tactical units to compose force packages optimized to specific urban combat objectives and challenges.  These tools will support planning and force composition for all missions relevant to the urban environment: command &amp; control, fires, maneuver, logistics, intelligence, force protection, and medical.  PROTEUS will be adaptive to an inherently dynamic and fluid environment that will account for the environmental influence of non-combatants in urban combat as well as kinetic warfighting.  Technologies will be integrated using systems of systems principles developed under the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project.  To support concept development, testing, and warfighter interaction, the program will also develop a supporting virtual testbed.

                                                    <r2:Description>Assault Breaker II (ABII) seeks to change the current warfighting paradigm of reliance on Service-specific, platform centric force executing prescribed kill chains to a highly adaptable, capability-based force operating as a disaggregated kill web able to execute rapidly composable, joint, all domain kill chains.  Building upon technologies developed in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, budgeted in this PE and Project NET-02, ABII will exploit both existing and emerging technologies across the Services to address known capability gaps, opportunities and threats.  ABII will conduct mission-centric, multi-Service and multi-domain analyses, modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), and experimentation to inform research and development and program of record recommendations, and will build an enduring, multi-service M&amp;S environment to support complex, mission level kill web analysis.  ABII will also design and develop a Vanguard Force DevOps Environment with physical nodes that will enable the transition of ABII technologies, concepts and architectures to transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Based upon technologies developed in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, the Air Combat Evolution (ACE)  program will apply technologies and principles of distributed autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI) to aerial within-visual-range (WVR) maneuvering, colloquially known as a dogfight, in modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), sub-scale, and ultimately full-scale vehicles.  The program will deliver an initial instantiation of a scalable AI controller enabling aircraft autonomy at levels ranging from an advanced tactical autopilot for dynamic maneuver to a form of multi-domain mosaic battle management controller.  Experiments will explore both augmentation of existing manned platforms and enhanced future unmanned systems.  ACE will provide an early opportunity to build operator trust in combat autonomy and demonstrate adaptive human-machine teaming tools and architectures.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment.  To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies.  The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes.  RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.</r2:Description>

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

By exploiting promising new developments in unmanned platforms, seafloor systems, and emerging long-range weapon systems, the program will develop an advanced, integrated undersea and above sea warfighting capability.  The CDMaST program will establish an analytical and experimental environment to explore architecture combinations in terms of operational effectiveness as well as engineering feasibility and robustness.  The program will leverage enabling technologies needed for command, control, and communication (C3) between physical domains in order to support the architecture constructs.

Integration of undersea elements for joint cross-domain operations is critical for developing the most effective distributed kill webs.  The Timely Information for Maritime Engagements (TIMEly) program will create a heterogeneous underwater network architecture that will span the ocean and bridge to other operating domains.  Building upon technologies learned in the Tactical Underwater Network Architecture and Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) programs, budgeted in this PE/Project, TIMEly will provide an adaptive, heterogeneous, scalable communications capability to link undersea and cross-domain assets together into kill webs with minimal operator burden.  The program will focus on developing architectures with the capability to transfer the right information to its intended purpose.  TIMEly will work within commonly understood limitations, with a focus on protocols, quality of service, and information exchange.  The program will leverage developments demonstrating short-range and long-range acoustic communications at higher bandwidth and greater reliability, while minimizing detectability.  The program will also leverage recent developments in network interoperability to manage heterogeneous undersea and cross-domain networks.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

The Disaggregated Strike Group - Manta Ray (DSG - Manta Ray) program seeks to develop a new class of long duration, long-range payload capable unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at an acquisition and lifecycle cost significantly less than current payload-capable UUVs.  This new class of UUV will give the combatant commander an amplification of capacity without disrupting current operations by remaining independent of manned vessels and ports once deployed.  The primary goal of the DSG - Manta Ray program is to open a design space for future UUVs that are capable of both long duration missions and large payload capacity.  A secondary goal of the program is to advance key technologies that will benefit other naval designs such as low lifecycle cost UUV operations, long duration energy management techniques, biofouling reduction technologies, and long duration navigational enablers.  The anticipated transition partner is the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>*Previously part of Maritime Missileer, formerly called Disaggregated Strike Group - Surface

No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) seeks to develop small, low-cost, disaggregated naval platforms to demonstrate the ability to perform persistent power projection and force application combat missions currently conducted from large, high-value capital ships.  The NOMARS program seeks to design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew.  NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the seaframe (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power.  The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that can operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance.  This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, which allows the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers.  A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low cost and low value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations.  Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, and marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state-of-the-art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention.  This program also has a companion applied research effort budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-03.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Sea Train program will support the delivery of masses of unmanned surface vessels into theater, without reliance on large, manned capital assets.  The Sea Train program will develop and demonstrate approaches to exploit the efficiencies of longer slender hulls, while enabling a distributed fleet of tactical Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs).  The Sea Train concept enables vessels that are efficient for transoceanic transport while enabling dispersed operations as individual vessels.  The Sea Train program will develop and demonstrate connector approaches to couple the vessels, the control laws required to drive the vessel in open ocean conditions, sensor approaches to understand the wave environment to efficiently navigate the vessel, and the autonomy required to connect and disconnect the vessels without human intervention.  The goal of this effort is to improve transport efficiency over what can be achieved with current monohull designs.  This allows for the efficient transport of smaller vessels into and out of theater, an operation that is normally accomplished today by carrying smaller vessels on board larger vessels or reliance on at-sea refueling of smaller vessels.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program will provide continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean over extended periods of time.  Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy.</r2:Description>

The MOCCA program aimed to nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems.  The off-board UUV sonar projector was planned to operate under positive control at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program achieved breakthrough capability for novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling.  The MOCCA communication system was integrated into submarine onboard sonar systems.  Communication technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment.  This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program sought to overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.  The program developed and demonstrated novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program focused on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program emphasized early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program provided the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment.  The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors is showing an impact for a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning.  For all of these applications, sensor gain had been achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays.  The TEAC program created the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively to focus energy undersea.  This provided an extensible, affordable, and flexible method to harness the rapid development of undersea vehicles and new acoustic source technologies.  Technologies developed under this program have transitioned to the Navy.</r2:Description>

                                <r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment.  

The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment.  Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.

The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.</r2:ProgramElementMissionDescription>

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

                                                    <r2:Description>Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets.  Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects.  Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas.  Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security.</r2:Description>

Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.</r2:ProjectMissionDescription>

Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time-consuming to build and integrate onto platforms.  The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems.  This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a System and Sensor Resource Manager (SSRM)).  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.  Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

The Military Tactical Means (MTM) program will develop sensors and exploitation techniques capable of performing wide-area search to detect high-value targets in order to task engagement systems to close effects-chains.  Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects-chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains.  Building upon technologies from the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, this program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide-area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors.  The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g. class-I or II unmanned aerial system).  The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains with possibly different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies.</r2:Description>

Electronic warfare (EW) covers these three aspects when the signals are electromagnetic in nature.  The NKE program will include EW innovation as a subset of NKE's broader objectives where signal includes electromagnetics and other non-kinetic modes of operation.  A new paradigm will be employed in NKE focused on offensive measures, as opposed to the traditional approach that concentrates on protection with attacks that are typically defensive and/or responsive in nature.  NKE will develop new technologies as required, but will primarily focus at the system level, where multi-system architectures will be developed.  System management and non-kinetic battle assessment technologies will be required to support the multi-mode NKE mission.  The NKE systems are applicable to force-on-force conflict, but will also provide new options for conducting hybrid operations at all scales of conflict.  Technologies will be transferred to the Services.</r2:Description>

                                                    <r2:Description>The Coho program will develop advanced signal processing technologies and techniques for future Radio Frequency (RF) systems.  These systems will create an asymmetric advantage for tactical operations in anti-access/area-denial environments by extending the real-time operating bandwidth of tactical signal processing, underpinning the ability of U.S. and Allied Forces to accurately orient and beneficially maneuver in the electromagnetic spectrum.  Based on technologies developed under the All-Signal Tactical Real-time Analyzer (ASTRAL) program, budgeted in this PE and Project, the objective of Coho is to provide ultra wide-band RF signal detection and recognition capabilities in a form factor suitable for tactical platforms.  Coho seeks to provide capabilities for multiple mission areas.  These capabilities include (1) surveillance: combining wide operating bandwidth with noise isolation for background electromagnetic search in the low signal to noise ratio environment, (2) filtering: isolating signals based on modulation features to process signals in the presence of co-channel interference, and (3) localization: supporting low-latency execution of multi-aperture processing for discrimination of signals based on angle of bearing.  Technology from Coho will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

SECTR-developed systems and technologies will be small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, and be applicable to a wide range of weapons and missions, such as small unit lethality, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and strike of time-sensitive targets.  Hardware technology will leverage passive Electro-Optical and Infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture.  SECTR will also develop a Government-owned open system architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software).  The technical approach to target recognition will start from "deep learning" and machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.</r2:Description>

Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads.  Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations, which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand.  This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites.

Building on technologies explored under the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program, also budgeted in this PE/Project, the objective of ASTRAL is to provide a factor of at least 1,000 times improvement over current signal awareness processing speed over broad spectral coverage.  The program will use technology that supports a development path leading to a mobile, tactical capability.  The development objectives of the ASTRAL program are to (1) develop a hybrid processor that provides real-time processing of the most challenging Low-Probability-of-Intercept (LPI) threat signals across a wide bandwidth, and (2) identify exploitation algorithms for military applications that are well-suited to this type of hybrid processor.  Several strategic and tactical spectrum awareness applications that may be addressed include, but are not limited to: (a) real-time exploitation of optical communications, (b) city-wide wireless device geo-location, (c) broadband LPI radar warning, and (d) theater-wide spread-spectrum LPI radio geo-location.

Based on research performed under the Resilient Synchronized Planning &amp; Assessment Contested Environment (RSPACE) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01, the purpose of the COMPASS program is to reduce ambiguity and reveal intent of gray zone actors who use techniques such as misinformation and intimidation to destabilize host nations and possibly produce advantageous conditions for military engagements. The tools produced by COMPASS will automate gray zone information operations and help U.S. forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and demonstrate tools to: 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments.

                                                    <r2:Description>Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data.  ATRs have typically been designed for specific sensors and provide only limited, static mission support due to pre-programmed target lists and operating modes.  Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets has been costly and time-consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program was to develop technologies that reduce operational limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life-cycle maintenance costs.  Breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms and embedded computing systems promised dramatic improvements in ATR utility.  The program focused on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enabled performance-driven sensing and ATR utility; (2) algorithm training technology that enabled rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduced required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software demands of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program transitioned to multiple agencies within the Department of Defense.</r2:Description>

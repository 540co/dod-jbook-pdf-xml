                                <proc:Description>Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) provides the President of the United States broad authorities to ensure the timely availability of domestic industrial base capabilities essential for the national defense. DPA Title III is an important DoD program with the authority to utilize economic incentives to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic sources for critical components, critical technology items, and industrial resources. The DPA is authorized by 50 U.S.C. Sections 4501-4568. 

This budget includes a project portfolio that will appropriately utilize DPA Title III authorities to strengthen domestic industrial base capabilities essential to national defense. The multi-year projects in this budget will incentivize domestic sources to establish, strengthen, and expand domestic industrial base capabilities in key areas such as strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics and the rare earths supply chain.</proc:Description>
                                <proc:Justification>Strategic overview:

DPA Title III investments are driven by strategy starting with the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. DPA Title III investments are also supporting Department of Defense modernization priorities and the recommendations from the interagency report in response to Executive Order 13806: Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States (E.O. 13806). 

Defense-Wide Review (DWR) reduced $7.915 million across the FYDP on Defense Production Act Purchases Title III to focus on the Secretary's guidance to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and promote greater affordability within the OSD and Defense Agencies and Field Activities in order to ensure the Department's optimum alignment to the National Defense Strategy and DoD strategic guidance, with particular focus on building a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready force while strengthening alliances, prioritizing cyber and space capabilities, and focusing on innovation to maintain the technological advantage.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has added $120 million to FY 2021 budget to aid the Department in resourcing the DPA Fund so the DPA Title III Program can address critical shortfalls in the domestic industrial base, as identified in the interagency report in response to Executive Order 13086, and ensure the industrial base can support the Department's strategic modernization initiatives. Industrial base efforts that this $120 million will fund include rare earths, critical chemicals, small unmanned aerial systems, hypersonic applications, electronics, and space. Specified numbers for each effort are estimates that are subject to change based on ongoing market research and the acquisition process. 

The National Security Space Industrial and Supply Base (NSS ISB) Risk Mitigation Program was developed to formulate a systematic process to fund mitigation efforts to rectify shortfalls in the space industrial and supply base. The objective is to ensure access to critical technologies and capabilities in the quality, quantity, and timeframes required to support U.S. Government space programs. Projects in this program are addressing cross-platform, multi-agency/Service requirements. Projects are developed in response to risk mitigation determinations and prioritized critical requirements of stakeholders in DoD and other agencies, as represented through the Department's Space Industrial Base Working Group.

This budget includes essential transformational initiatives using the authorities of Title III of the DPA. Project descriptions are provided below for each of the P5 exhibit projects listed, and the single or multi-year cost phasing of each of the projects is addressed in the P5 exhibit.

Project Descriptions:

NSS ISB – Space Qualified Solar Cell Supply Chain: The purpose of these projects is to ensure a domestic capability to supply this critical power supply component for national security space assets. Projects involve ensuring a viable domestic source for space qualified germanium substrates and high performance photovoltaic cells, panels, and systems. Current projects are helping domestic photovoltaic manufacturing and integration companies maintain their performance lead over foreign competitors by expanding production of AIAA S-111 space-qualified photovoltaic solar cells with improved cost and performance efficiencies. Performance improvements include characterizing high-efficiency inverted metamorphic (IMM) solar cells grown on Gallium Arsenide substrates as a drop-in replacement for ZTJ triple-junction solar cells, and completing the qualification of the IMM solar cells to the AIAA S-111A standard. Other improvements on high-efficiency XTJ Prime triple- junction solar cells grown on Germanium substrates include increasing the cell Beginning-of-Life efficiency and reducing End-of-Life cost per watt. Multiple awards were made in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds. Additional projects are expected to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

NSS ISB - Next Generation Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA): This project addresses a need for a multiple-phase Next-Generation scalable Reaction Wheel (NGRW) to provide a systematic comprehensive, low cost/risk investment affording potential for high return on investment. The goal is to generate or revive a domestic competitor, or to expand the existing vendor's product line, with a focus on smaller wheels using advanced technologies. In addition, the effort will explore encouraging a business partnership to maintain a second source in the U.S. Also, the project will investigate using another product controlled by a U.S. company. A study phase was completed and the execution phase is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

NSS ISB - Radiation-Hardened Digital/Analog Production &amp; Qualification: This project funds work at the 45nm and 14nm nodes.  It is imperative that government organizations responsible for national security, e.g., intelligence acquisition, missile early warning, missile defense, and other space requirements maintain a strong industrial base to supply technology necessary to design, develop, and fabricate secure, radiation hardened, high reliability, and DoD space qualified Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP), such as very high speed data switches, and Multi-Core General Purpose Processors (MCGPP) at the less than or equal to 45nm technology node to support onboard processing and other critical applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the Radiation Hardened By Design flow, optimize selected circuit designs to reduce power and increase performance, and complete the design, fabrication, testing, and qualification of certain critical devices to include the MC-GPP. In addition to achieving an estimated improvement in performance of > 25% for power and performance for some specific designs, the proposed effort will support life-time acquisition buys of these critical circuits for some identified systems with attendant reductions in system technical, cost, and schedule risks.

Critical Chemicals for DoD Missiles and Munitions: Multiple efforts are being scoped to address critical shortfalls in the domestic industrial capability to produce materials for DoD missiles and munitions. In January 2019, the President signed four Presidential Determinations addressing vulnerabilities in the supply chain for critical chemicals for DoD munitions, including: precursor materials, inert materials, energetic materials, and advanced manufacturing techniques for producing the materials. Relying on foreign sources, especially China, for these critical chemicals poses a risk to the Department's readiness to deter and defeat adversaries. Multiple projects are anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing FY 2019 funds.

Rare Earth Supply Chain: In July 2019, the President signed 5 Presidential Determinations addressing the rare earth elements supply chain, including: Light Rare Earth Separation and Processing, Heavy Rare Earth Separation and Processing, Production of Rare Earth Metals and Alloys, Production of Neodymium Iron Boron Rare Earth Permanent Magnets, and Production of Samarium Cobalt Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. This line of effort will establish a domestic industrial capability to support key aspects of the rare earth supply chain. China dominates the Rare Earth Elements (REE) market on a global scale in both mining and processing of RE raw materials and has the ability to manipulate global markets. Relying on foreign sources for these critical materials poses a risk to the DoD's readiness to deter and defeat adversaries. Important defense applications for the end product of this supply chain, REE permanent magnets, include jet fighter engines, missile guidance systems, antimissile defense, space-based satellites, and communication systems. Efforts are currently being developed to bolster the domestic industrial base to support the separation and processing of rare earth elements and domestic production capability for Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) rare earth permanent magnets. Multiple projects are anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

Hypersonics Industrial Base: The DPA Title III program is actively working with stakeholders to identify gaps in the industrial capability to produce components for hypersonic systems and scale production from prototype levels to the required capacity. Multiple projects are anticipated to address hypersonic industrial base shortfalls, should the President authorize the use of DPA Title III authorities.

Assured Electronics Supply: The challenges facing the electronics industrial base are wide-reaching and significant. Commercial industry has trended toward yearly product refreshes and updating technology nodes frequently, leaving legacy DoD systems that must be maintained for decades with severe obsolescence issues. On the opposite end of the spectrum, new systems that desire to integrate the newest technologies face challenges obtaining assured and/or trusted supply as much of the electronics manufacturing supply chain has gone overseas. In addition, domestic suppliers that exist are reluctant to work with unique DoD requirements as it would negatively affect their commercial runs and overall business viability. The DPA Title III Program, in concert with its stakeholders, is working to identify and vet efforts to serve DoD's need for electronic materials, digital/analog/mixed signal integrated circuits, discrete components, displays, power electronic components, electro-optical/IR components, radio frequency components, advanced packaging, and other cross-cutting technologies.

Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS): In June 2019, the President issued a Presidential Determination authorizing the use DPA Title III to strengthen the domestic industrial base for sUAS. The sUAS domestic industrial base has struggled to compete commercially in the midst of dominant foreign competition and DPA Title III is currently assessing where investments would best remedy the domestic industrial base shortfall and result in an economically viable domestic supplier. The DPA Title III program is working with stakeholders across USG to determine an appropriate investment strategy to enable the domestic industrial base to meet requirements. FY 2020 funds have been aligned to this effort with awards anticipated as early as late FY 2020, with additional efforts to follow depending upon the availability of funds.

Examples include lighter and stronger body armor, helmets, pelvic protection, enhanced combat vehicle survivability, enhanced aviation platform survivability, and integrated base protection. A next generation of co-polymer aramid fibers would provide a step-change increase in tenacity over existing fibers, a key attribute for enabling lighter-weight ballistic protection. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds, and funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.

Secure Composite Shipping Containers Production Capacity: Developed under funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), the Secure Hybrid Composite Container (SHCC) is an intermodal ISO shipping container providing advanced security features, while meeting all the operational, structural, and customs requirements of standard steel 20ft and 40ft shipping containers. The container includes the capability to be tracked during its shipment and alert officials to track deviations and alarms. The ultimate goal of the container is to provide the level of security to law enforcement officials to ensure contraband products and malicious agents have not been inserted into the container for smuggling into the US. Investment under Title III to establish initial production capability for the secure hybrid composite container can help satisfy an estimated 3,000 container per year initial government need from the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community agencies requiring secure shipping containers. A production line with an output of approximately 100 containers per year output is planned. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funding.

Shielded Infrastructures: The purpose of this project is to further increase the production capacity of conductive composite nanomaterials to meet emerging DoD requirements for light weight, unique form factor, electromagnetically shielded products. It is anticipated to leverage the success of a prior DPA Title III project by integrating and scaling the technology (chemical vapor depositioned nickel coated nano-materials) into other novel applications such as non-metallic enclosures, cases, laminates, injection moldings, wallpapers, paints, windows, etc. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

Lithium Sea-Water Batteries: The purpose of this project is to establish the domestic production capability for Lithium Sea-Water (Li-SW) batteries. Currently, no commercially available battery technology has been tested to meet the energy-density, performance, and environment requirements needed to enable the Next Generation Airborne Passive Sensor (NGAPS) sonobuoys. The Office of Naval Research has conducted research and proven that Li-SW batteries will be able to meet the NGAPS requirements if manufactured in the required form factor. The need exists to establish a production line for Li-SW batteries, and to maintain affordable unit prices to support the DoD's needs. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

Alane (AlH3) Fuel: This project will create the domestic manufacturing capability for Aluminum Hydride (AlH3) or "Alane" Fuel.  Alane fuel is a high-energy-density fuel that is not petroleum-based and is environmentally friendly. Alane fuel cells utilized in Alane-fuel-powered systems provide higher energy density than the traditional lithium ion batteries on the market. Alane fuel-powered systems are alternatives to the traditional battery packs utilized in military platforms and by soldiers today.  These small form factor systems reduce the load carrying burden on soldiers and systems, therefore increasing mobility, operational effectiveness, and survivability. There is currently no domestic industrial manufacturing capability for these cells and a public/private partnership under the authorities of Title III of the Defense Production Act will spur industry to create the initial capability to meet defense needs as well as provide an impetus for domestic commercial adaptability and use of the technology. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds, and funding was reallocated to reflect updated project requirements.

Thin Wall Castings for Military Applications: Domestic foundries prefer to prioritize high volume, low-risk commercial work over low volume, high-risk defense work. This environment has led to a reduced number of suppliers qualified to provide large, aerospace-grade castings, limited investment in new technologies, and increased cost and lead-times for defense aerospace-related casting products. The objective of this project is to sustain and expand economically viable, merchant suppliers for large, complex, thin-walled aerospace grade magnesium and aluminum sand casting products for rotorcraft platforms, such as the CH-53K. This project was awarded in FY 2020 and is utilizing prior year funds.

High Purity Beryllium: The purpose of this project is to ensure the availability of high purity Beryllium metal for DoD and national security requirements through capital improvements to an existing sole source supplier. Beryllium, a light weight metal, possesses unique properties that make it indispensable in many of today's critical defense systems. High purity beryllium is used extensively in structures, digital electronics, and instruments found in defense weapon systems where stiffness, low weight, good thermal conductivity, and dimensional stability are required. Defense demand for beryllium generally includes the following four areas: sensors, missile and satellite applications, avionics, and nuclear weapons managed by the Department of Energy. This project is a follow-on to a previous DPA Title III project from 2005 to 2012 which established the domestic production capability for primary High Purity Beryllium metal through the design and implementation of a facility. The current project will implement capital improvements required to gain production efficiencies at the facility constructed by the previous effort. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing prior year funds.

AN-SSQ Series Sonobuoys Production Capability: The purpose of this effort is to ensure the availability of qualified AN/SSQ-101B sonobuoys. The domestic industrial base for AN/SSQ series sonobuoys was deemed at risk of not being able to produce the needed classes and quantities of sonobuoys and would require assistance to establish the required production lines. This project is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2020 utilizing prior year funds.

F135 Integrally Bladed Rotors (IBR): The purpose of this effort is to expediently restore the domestic production capacity for 2nd and 3rd stage integrally bladed rotors (IBRs) for the F135 engine to minimize impact on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) delivery schedule. This effort mitigates the loss of a qualified source in the F135 engine's global supply chain. This project was awarded in FY 2019 utilizing FY 2019 funds.

Three-Dimensional (3D) Microelectronics for Information Protection: The purpose of this effort is to establish a domestic, merchant supplier manufacturing capability to provide two- and three-dimensional high density packaging technology, which accepts a wide range of custom and commercial-off-the-shelf components that can drastically increase the security of DoD platforms. This DPA Title III effort is working to create a low rate initial production capability of the packaging technology to enable the early DoD adopters to reliably procure products and achieve cost savings for their programs. The contract for this project was awarded in March 2018, and a second phase of this effort is anticipated to be awarded in FY 2021 utilizing FY 2021 funds.</proc:Justification>

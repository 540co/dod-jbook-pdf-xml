The TIEW ENV integrated Threat IO (Electronic Attack, Electronic Support, Computer Network Operations) models into the One Semi-Automated Force (OneSAF) baseline. The models' representative effects were also integrated through use with Communications Effects Servers. Integration of OneSAF with the Integrated Threat Force (ITF) enabled the Live and Constructive T&E environments to interface.  To date the program had completed numerous models to include Communications Jamming (simulates frequencies, ranges, spot, barrage, and other behaviors); Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Jamming (can jam GPS frequencies in variety of ways by adjusting the parameters and can emulate real GPS jammers); GPS Repeater Jammer (offset GPS signals so as to provide false location reports.  Had several adjustable behavioral parameters); Spoofer Jammer (offsets GPS signals so as to provide false location reports with several adjustable behavioral parameters); and Signal Intelligence\/Direction Finding (SIGINT\/DF) (detector models that work with each other to triangulate and then report on emissions of various frequencies and was parameter adjustable).  The program continued to develop the Computer Network Operations (CNO) cyber model which build CNO entities (hacker entities, systems, networks, etc.) that can be attacked, defended, and exploited (Disruption, Delay, Denial of Service, Destruction, and Injection) as well as allowed live attacks to interact with the constructive environment for large enterprise asset emulation cyber attacks, all within OneSAF.  The program also began the development of the Threat Cellular Network Model (TCNM) which was building the threat cellular and landline interfaces needed to emulate the communications systems often found in theater as used by enemy combatants.  The TIEW ENV program also integrated the capability to communicate, via the ITF, with live assets including the CICADA jammer, Threat Signal Injection Jammers (TSIJ), Wideband Configurable Controlled Jammer (WCCJ) and the Networked Electronic Support Threat Sensors (NESTS)."

Modern weapons require test, evaluation, and training using threat representative aerial targets to assess their effectiveness on the battlefield.  This program encompasses a family of rotary and fixed-wing targets; full-scale, miniature, and subscale targets; virtual targets; ancillary devices; and their control systems.  These products are required to adequately stress weapon systems undergoing test and evaluation (T&E).  In order to stress systems during T&E, aerial targets must have flight characteristics, signatures, and other performance factors that emulate the modern threat.  This program includes long-range planning to determine future target needs and development of coordinated requirement documents; the management of target research, development, test and evaluation process; execution of the validation process to ensure that surrogate targets adequately represent the threat; development and acquisition of surrogate and acquired targets; and continuing maintenance, storage, and development\/enhancement\/update via engineering services of the developed and acquired threat targets to ensure availability for the T&E customer.  The Army is the Reliance lead for rotary wing targets and towed target developments and the Tri-Service lead for procurement and enhancement of the MQM-107 fixed wing target."

Army Test and Evaluation Command's (ATEC) activities which include: Yuma Test Center (YTC), AZ; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), MD; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), AZ; White Sands Test Center (WSTC), NM; Redstone Test Center (RTC), AL. \n\nProjects are designated as a major test program based on their visibility, assessed relative technical risk (medium-high), schedule risk, cost (generally greater than $1.5 Million per year or $7.5 Million for the total project) and applicability to other mission areas or services.  These projects are technically demanding, state-of-the-art, unique instrumentation assets or suites to meet the technology shortfalls, and generally result from development programs managed by a professional project management team.  \nFiber Optic Network II (FON II) is the installation of digital fiber optic cable and transmission electronics to modernize, secure and expand the backbone telecommunication and data transmission network in support of Aberdeen Test Center.  Systems Test and Integration Laboratory (STIL) is the development of a systems integration and test lab for use in developmental testing and integration engineering, including a virtual test environment to support integration testing of aviation electronic systems as a part of modernization of army aircraft.  Advanced Distributed Modular Acquisition System (ADMAS) Product Improvement Program (PIP) develops very small and low power pocket sized ADMAS systems which will extend the Versatile Information Systems Integrated Online system's (VISION) capabilities to support dismounted and small robotic platforms.  Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) will replace obsolete tracking radars at Redstone Test Center (RTC), Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) with modern instrumentation radars.  CRIIS Objective Program provides precision location instrumentation which will significantly increase the T&E ranges' capability to meet the test instrumentation needs of the tri-service range users.  Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Electromagnetic Radiation Effects (EMRE) Systems Modernization will upgrade equipment at the WSMR EMRE site where E3 testing is performed to evaluate survivability and vulnerability of military systems.  Project will upgrade and replace signal transmitters, refurbish an anechoic test chamber, replace data acquisition equipment and install a new turntable to support test items.  Nuclear Effects Test Capability Modernization upgrades nuclear facilities at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  These upgrades include the Relativistic Electron Beam Accelerator (REBA), Fast Burn Reactor, Gamma Range Facility, Linear Electron Accelerator (LINAC), Electromagnetic Pulse and the Solar Furnace. Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) plans to develop and produce Warrior-representative ATDs that incorporate associated biomedically-validated injury assessment tools to better characterize dynamic events and injury risks measured in Live Fire Test & Evaluation (LFT&E) and vehicle development efforts."

This effort responds to the current Operations Tempo (OPTEMPO) and Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO) demands to force the U.S. Army by virtually replicating a greater number of troop resources in force-on-force testing and training exercises to conduct more realistic, accurate, and comprehensive evaluations at reduced costs.  \n\nOperational Test Command (OTC) Advanced Simulation & Instrumentation Systems (OASIS) Enterprise Integration System (EIS) supports the OTC simulation and test support capabilities will transition to Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) Test and Evaluation Enterprise Architecture (ATEA).  Operational testing of enterprise\/systems of systems (SoS) capabilities requires an integrated test technology tools enterprise: 1) Test Planning & Control systems\/networks, 2) Live-virtual-constructive (LVC) simulations, 3) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis (DCRA), and visualization tools and 4) tactical systems and networks. The OASIS-EIS will support test tool integration in three major areas:  1) harmonize OT test technology integration with other acquisition efforts (RTCA, networks, data collection) at the ATEC level, 2) Joint Network Emulation (JNE) program management to PEO-STRI (PM-ITTS) to support leverage by other PEO STRI and ATEC offices (initially TSMO, EPG and RTC), and 3) develop an ATEC and PEO-STRI program to achieve efficiencies and cost savings through shared development and enhancement of key simulation (primarily gaming, virtual, and constructive), and LVC integration capabilities.  Initial focus for shared simulation\/LVC enablers will be in the area of network, fires and ISR simulations and LVC architecture planning, engineering and integration tools."

The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."

The Arroyo Center draws its researchers from RAND's staff of nearly 700 professionals trained in a broad range of disciplines.  Most staff members work in RAND's principal locations-Santa Monica, California; Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The RAND Arroyo Center provides for continuing analytical research across a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, grouped in four major research areas:  Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources; Military Logistics; Manpower and Training; and Force Development and Technology.  The RAND Arroyo Center research agenda is primarily focused on mid\/long-term concerns.  Results and analytical findings directly affect senior leadership deliberations on major issues.  Arroyo Center research is sponsored by the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army; the Army Assistant Secretaries; and most of the Army's major commands.  The Arroyo Center is provided guidance from the Army through the Arroyo Center Policy Committee (ACPC), which is co-chaired by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology).  The ACPC reviews, monitors, and approves the annual Arroyo Center research plan.  Each project requires General Officer (or SES equivalent) sponsorship and involvement on a continuing basis.  RAND Arroyo provides the Army with a unique multidisciplinary capability for independent analysis."

Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration\/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  USAKA\/RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation\/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA\/RTS infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA\/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at USAKA\/RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of USAKA\/RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs."

Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonics developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration\/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttleand orbital debris experiments.  USAKA\/RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for both the RTS instrumentation suite and installation\/base operations and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  Funding is required to maintain O&M support, while accepting moderate risk of continued degradation of USAKA\/RTS infrastructure (housing, offices, and facilities), higher future repair costs, and reduced logistical support capability.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA\/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at USAKA\/RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of USAKA\/RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs."

Its function is to support test and evaluation of major Army and DoD acquisition programs and to provide space operations (surveillance and object identification) in support of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific and space programs.  Programs supported include Army missile defense, Air Force and Navy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) developmental and operational tests; Army, Air Force and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hypersonic developmental tests; Missile Defense Agency (MDA) demonstration\/validation tests; , USSTRATCOM space situational awareness requirements (inc contributions to the U.S. Space Surveillance Network); and NASA Space Shuttle and orbital debris experiments.  RTS is a government-managed\/contractor-operated (GMCO) site and is dependent upon its associated support contractors for operations and maintenance (O&M).  Program funds contractors to accomplish O&M for RTS instrumentation suites and provides mission essential bandwidth via a fiber optics cable system.  The instrumentation suite consists of a number of sophisticated, one-of-a-kind, radar, optical, telemetry, command\/control\/communications, safety, and data reduction systems.  These systems include the four unique radars of the Kiernan Reentry Measurement Site (KREMS); Super Recording Automatic Digital Optical Tracker (SRADOT) long range video-metric tracking systems; high density data recorders for high data-rate telemetry collected by nine antennas; an underwater acoustic impact location system; and data analysis\/reduction hardware\/software.  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar (ALTAIR), and the Target Resolution Discrimination Experiment (TRADEX) radars located at USAKA\/RTS, are two of only three radars world-wide that have deep-space tracking capability.  The Millimeter Wave Radar (MMW) is the most powerful imaging radar in the world.  Funding enables weapon system assessment of operational effectiveness and suitability for the Army, Air Force, Navy and MDA, which all have programs planned that have significant test and data gathering requirements at RTS.  This test data cannot be obtained except through the use of technical facilities available on and in the vicinity of RTS.  Program supports Army's PATRIOT air defense system and the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon technology development program; Air Force's Minuteman III ICBM and the Space and Missile Center's associated programs; MDA's Ballistic Missile Defense System, Flexible Target Family (FTF), and Family of Systems; NASA's Space Transportation System (STS), Small Expendable Deployer System and Orbital Debris Measurement Programs."

The intended outcome of this integrative effort is to develop concept capability plans that inform the Capabilities Integration Development System (CIDS) process and define future requirements, enabling identification and acquistion of critical Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leader Development, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) capabilities for the future force to provide land power capabilities needed by Joint and Army commanders.  In FY 2012-2018, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding specifically enables the World Class Blue Force (subject matter experts overseeing and coordinating experiments efforts from Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) proper in collaboration with the Schools and Centers), support for Red Cell analysis, and support to Maneuver Brigade Experiments.  Experimentation enables enhanced situational awareness, planning requirements, employment and management of accelerated decision cycles in a network-enabled force, and training requirements of new and emerging technologies.\n\nARCIC, Accelerated Capabilities Division (ACD) (formerly Asymmetric Warfare Division) develops immediate capability solutions in support of the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) prioritized Current Force capability gaps (i.e. Force Protection, Networked Battle Command, Logistics and Medical in Counterinsurgency Operations (COIN) and Soldier Protection).  ACD conducts Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and DOTMLPF analysis required to ensure capability gap candidate solutions are properly integrated prior to being equipped to deployed forces.  Supports pre-deployment and in-theater assessments to ensure candidate solution meet identifiied requirements, support tactics, techniques and procedures development for use by deployed forces, and ensure equipped systems provide the necessary capability to fill an identified gap.  These assessments support determination of a path forward for equipped system by identifying them as a potential Program of Record (POR) or sustain in theater.  CONOPS, DOTMLPF-Cost analysis and assessment assist deployed forces by ensuring they are able to properly employ equipped systems and assist senior Army leadership in determining how best to resource solution to high priority capability gaps."

Experiments inform Army future concepts and assess high-risk conceptual assumptions in order to focus required capabilities and represent the user's requirements in the future Army.  TRADOC's partnership with ASA(ALT) in connecting Soldiers to the ideas and capabilities earlier rather than later, provides essential user feedback and assists the acquisition community with informing the Army's investment portfolio and decreasing the number of engineering design changes.  Army experiments use the combined resources of Army battle laboratories, operational units, research labs, materiel developers, industry and academia to collaborate in the development, refinements, and assessment of future force concepts - to inform capability developments and validate concepts for current and future force.  In FY12-18, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding enables World Class Blue Force (WCBLUFOR) to provide technical and tactical expertise in Army experiment efforts, in collaboration and integration with Joint, Interagency, Intergovermental, and Multinational partners.  In the near-term, Army experimentation will focus on Prevent, Shape, and Win as foundational elements for this campaign, assessed across all joint campaign phases, with Army level issues across the breadth of a champaign that highlights integration of Army 2020 initiatives."

OTC consists of four forward Test Directorates (Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate, Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Integrated Test and Evaluation Directorate, Fort Bliss, Texas; Fires Test Directorate, Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate, Fort Huachuca, Arizona) together with four other Test Directorates (Aviation; Maneuver; Mission Command; Maneuver Support and Sustainment) at Ft Hood, Texas. These activities support the development and fielding cycle of all Army acquisition programs including rapid fielding initiatives in support of operations in Afghanistan. Sustainment funding maintains existing testing capabilities at all locations by replacing unreliable, uneconomical, and irreparable instrumentation, as well as incremental upgrades of hardware and software for M&S and instrumentation systems to assure adequate test data collection capabilities. This data supports acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army including programs such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), Network Integration Evaluation (NIE), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Patriot Advance Capability Phase 3 (PAC-3), Armored Multipurpose Vehicle (AMPV), Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and the Army Battle Command System (ABCS) which includes Joint Battle Command - Platform. This Program Element develops and sustains developmental and operational test capabilities that provide key support to the Army's three roles: Prevent, Shape, and Win Decisively. In addition this Program Element supports Overseas Contingency Operations by providing instrumentation to support ATEC's 24\/7 mission at YTC, Arizona, WSMR, New Mexico and ATC, Maryland supporting the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), as well as efforts throughout ATEC in support of the Army's Rapid Equipping the Force (REF) initiative."

These capabilities are required to support developmental testing requirements of high priority Army systems being rapidly fielded to Afghanistan, and those systems supporting Army modernization efforts. Where practical, efficiencies will be gained through the common use of developmental instrumentation in operational testing.  A key element is sustaining aging instrumentation which maintains existing capabilities at test facilities by replacing unreliable, uneconomical and irreparable instrumentation, as well as lifecycle replacement and incremental upgrades of instrumentation and software, reducing their average age to assure adequate testing capabilities. This project develops and sustains developmental test instrumentation and capabilities that provide the data necessary to support acquisition milestone decisions for all commodity areas throughout the Army. Significant examples include new instrumentation for the testing of body armor and other soldier protective equipment, advanced methods for testing the survivability of ground vehicles and aircraft, refurbishment of kineto-tracking mounts (precise optical instruments used in missile and aviation testing), and an expanded instrumentation suite in support of the growing mission to test Command, Control, Communication and Computer (C4) systems."

Operational Test (OT) Instrumentation collects required data from both the systems being tested and the surrounding activities.  OT simulation enhances the live forces conducting operational testing by simulating additional units, message traffic, effects, and terrain. The Army's OPTEMPO has reduced the number of tactical units and vehicles available to support OT, making augmentation through simulation needed at times to test in a realistic, operational environment. The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets and Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) provides development of major simulation and instrumentation systems while ATEC adapts systems from other organizations, purchases off-the-shelf systems, develops minor new systems, and sustains all ATEC simulation and instrumentation systems.  The OT Simulation and Instrumentation (S&I) (Sustainment and Minor Development) program funds the expertise and the adaptation, purchases, minor development and sustainment requirements that support systems undergoing OT. Costs unique to specific systems under test may require Program Manager (PM) funding."

Products result from investigating, analyzing, assessing, and reporting on the survivability of Soldiers, and on the survivability, lethality and vulnerability (SLV) of the highest priority Army systems whether those systems are employed during stability, support, defensive, or offensive missions.  Developed through measurement, experiment, test support, and modeling and simulation (M&S), the products funded by this project are used in many ways to make the Army force more survivable.  The project provides quantitative lethality and survivability analyses and data for fielded and developmental systems as the Army makes the required choices to decisively transform into a modular Brigade Combat Team (BCT) based organization.  Specific survivability analysis products include assessments of systems such as Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP), Stryker, Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), Army fire support systems, direct fire munitions; Army air defense and missile defense systems; Army aviation systems including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; network communications and other network enabled battle command systems communication systems; and selected joint services systems particularly relevant to the Army's joint and expeditionary role.  Products also include analysis and data concerning individual Soldier items including protective equipment such as helmets and vests.  These survivability products are leveraged into rapid-equipping initiatives and other technical support for operational forces involved in the current fight.  Continued development of these products also guarantees preservation of the Army's vitally needed technical corporate memory for expert survivability advice.\n\nSurvivability analyses funded by this project are conducted across the spectrum of battlefield threats to include guns, missiles, mines and other methods of inflicting physical damage; jammers, countermeasures, and other electronic warfare techniques; information assurance and computer network operations; and directed energy weapons.  This survivability information enables developers, users, and decision makers to perform credible survivability tradeoffs for both Soldiers and materiel.  These technical survivability details enable properly informed decisions concerning systems and tactics that maximize both the combat power and survivability of Army forces.  Survivability data and analysis results funded by this project are efficiently leveraged for many different Army uses, reducing total cost to the Army by eliminating the need for duplicative capabilities funded by individual system developers.  Central funding of this mission assures the Army accurate and consistent treatment of survivability across all classes of systems, across all formal system Evaluations, and across the Army's AR 5-5 studies process.  Work program is prioritized principally by the ATEC\/AEC and is used by them in the Army's formal Evaluation process in such a way that ATEC can comply with its legally mandated responsibility to assess system survivability along with effectiveness and suitability.  Program Managers (PM) and the Program Executive Officers (PEO) use the survivability analyses and data funded by this project to make design decisions that are optimized for survivability, to direct specific weapon system development efforts that are needed for survivability enhancement, and to structure product improvement programs. Soldier survivability data and analysis is leveraged to support the survivability portion of the HQDA G1 MANPRINT program.  TRADOC combat developers exploit the survivability products funded by this project to initiate and improve survivability\/lethality requirements, and to develop and refine doctrine and tactics.  Also, the quantitative analytical results funded by the project are leveraged as core inputs to formal AR 5-5 studies and other studies as directed by Army leaders.  While the Army is at war, analytical results funded by this project are also directly leveraged for survivability support to current operations.  Finally, for particularly urgent or controversial survivability issues, data and analysis funded by this project are used directly by senior Army decision makers to assure technically sound program\/production decisions.   \n \nThis project also supports highly technical specialized information assurance and computer network defense survivability analysis of Army battle command\/networked systems as well as Army network architectures and technology.  Supports ATEC and other electronic warfare vulnerability testers and evaluators by developing and providing highly technical specialized field countermeasure environments that threat forces may employ against Army communications networks, air defense and other systems.

Specifically, HEL weapons will play a major role in the Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortars (CRAM) initiative and can be a key component of the Future Force supporting Full Dimensional Protection. HELSTF is part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports Tri-Service HEL research and development to include damage, vulnerability, propagation, and lethality laser testing as well as HEL weapon developmental and operational test and evaluation (DTE&OTE).  The HELSTF's laser development support capabilities include a fully certified open-air HEL test range, test cells for bringing breadboard to brassboard test devices, fully integrated Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence (C3I) systems and a suite of beam directors to perform both static and dynamic tracking tests.  Other capabilities include an extensive array of fully instrumented test sites, full laser meteorological support, and an approved site for above-the-horizon dynamic HEL testing certified for predictive avoidance by the Laser Clearing House.  HELSTF's location on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) provides unparalleled testing flexibility because of WSMR's 3200 square miles of controlled land mass and 7000 square miles of controlled airspace.  This location also enables HELSTF to leverage the existing WSMR T&E infrastructure. Current HELSTF facilities include the Sea Lite Beam Director (SLBD), the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL), the Large Vacuum Chamber (LVC) with associated Vacuum Test System (VTS), the Solid State Laser testbed, the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) testbed, and the Low Power Chemical Laser (LPCL).  This multiple use facility supports testing of laser effects for targets ranging from material coupon testing up through full-scale static and dynamic targets, explosive targets, and testing of targets in a high altitude space environment.  HELSTF has embarked on its own modernization to fully upgrade its mission control systems, develop state-of-the-art HEL diagnostic capabilities, data reduction, and a mobile HEL diagnostic test suite to support DTE and OTE for potential HEL weapons in the Army Future Force in all relevant combat environments."

Specifically, HEL weapons will play a major role in the Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortars (CRAM) initiative and can be a key component of the Future Force supporting Full Dimensional Protection. HELSTF is part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports Tri-Service HEL research and development to include damage, vulnerability, propagation, and lethality laser testing as well as HEL weapon developmental and operational test and evaluation (DTE&OTE).  The HELSTF's laser development support capabilities include a fully certified open-air HEL test range, test cells for bringing breadboard to brassboard test devices, fully integrated Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence (C3I) systems and a suite of beam directors to perform both static and dynamic tracking tests.  Other capabilities include an extensive array of fully instrumented test sites, full laser meteorological support, and an approved site for above-the-horizon dynamic HEL testing certified for predictive avoidance by the Laser Clearing House.  HELSTF's location on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) provides unparalleled testing flexibility because of WSMR's 3200 square miles of controlled land mass and 7000 square miles of controlled airspace.  This location also enables HELSTF to leverage the existing WSMR T&E infrastructure. Current HELSTF facilities include the Sea Lite Beam Director (SLBD),  an IPG Photonics 20 kilo-watt fiber laser, the Large Vacuum Chamber (LVC) with associated Vacuum Test System (VTS), the Ground Target Irradiance Measurement (GTIM) system, the Target Reflected Energy Measurement (TREM) system, the Solid State Laser testbed, the Pointer Tracker System (PTS) beam director, and a suite of low power lasers to support testing.  This multiple use facility supports testing of laser effects for targets ranging from material coupon testing up through full-scale static and dynamic targets, explosive targets, and testing of targets in a high altitude space environment.  HELSTF has embarked on its own modernization to fully upgrade its mission control systems, develop state-of-the-art HEL diagnostic capabilities, data reduction, and a mobile HEL diagnostic test suite to support DTE and OTE for potential HEL weapons in the Army Future Force in all relevant combat environments."

It provides independent airworthiness qualification of all assigned developmental and in-production Army aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as required by AR 70-62, and is essential for ensuring the safe operation of Army aircraft.  This program, when fully funded, performs all engineering functions (design, analysis, testing, demonstrations, and system specification compliance) essential for certifying the airworthiness of assigned Army aircraft, to include performing safety-of-flight investigations\/assessments, evaluating system risks, developing Airworthiness Impact Statements, developing Airworthiness Releases, and evaluating Safety of Flight Messages and Aviation Safety Action Messages for new and upgraded aircraft systems.  This program also provides management\/execution of the Army's Aeronautical Design Standards (ADS) program; management\/execution of airworthiness approval for new systems and materiel changes for all assigned Army aircraft systems; airworthiness engineering support to the Program Executive Office for Aviation (PEO Avn) and the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO, the Army's Special Operations Aircraft program office) in developing requirements for major development\/modification and for any future systems\/subsystems; and management of the test and evaluation process in support of the airworthiness qualification process.  The Airworthiness Certification program also performs general research and development in support of aircraft qualification and overarching airworthiness projects that involve multiple aircraft models.  Current ongoing programs requiring airworthiness qualification are PEO Aviation and TAPO Future Force systems including Longbow Apache Block II and III; Chinook F-model; Blackhawk M-model and; Special Operations MH-47G and MH-60M; Armed Aerial Scout (AAS); Light Utility Helicopter; Gray Eagle  unmanned aircraft system (UAS); Enhanced Multi-sensor Airborne Reconnaissance and Sensor System (EMARSS); and Shadow-C UAS.  Additionally the Airworthiness Certification program supports application of other critical aviation subsystems onto Army aircraft, including Aircraft Survivability Equipment (e.g. Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM), Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), Aviation Mission Equipment (e.g. advanced multiband radios like the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and digital data links), Common Sensor (electro-optical multi-spectrum visual sensor), and Blue Force Tracker.  The D092 funding profile for the FY14 President's Budget Submission marginally funds the airworthiness certification program and therefore the effort will be limited to resourcing military use civil derivative aircraft technical qualification through the Federal Aviation Administration's Military Certification Office; development of airworthiness procedures, specifications, critical standards, and other design and qualification documents; participation in airworthiness related tri-service activities (e.g. National Airworthiness Council, Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group) and international airworthiness related activities mandated by treaty (e.g. Flight Into Non-segregated Airspace (FINAS); and limited early airworthiness involvement in Technology Transition projects ( e.g. Joint Multi Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator  and Future Vertical Lift aircraft) and other Office of the Secretary of Defense initiatives."

Meteorological support to research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) activities provides standard and specialized weather forecasts and data for test reports to satisfy Army\/Department of Defense RDT&E test requirements for modern weaponry, e.g., (1) unique atmospheric analysis and sampling to include atmospheric transmittance, extinction, optical scintillation, infrared temperature, aerosol\/smoke cloud dispersion characteristics, and ballistic meteorological measurements; (2) test event forecasting to include prediction of sound propagation for ballistic firing tests, specialized prediction of light levels and target to background measurements, and predictions for electro-optical testing and ballistic artillery\/mortar firing; and (3) advisory and warning products such as go\/no-go test recommendations for ballistic and atmospheric probe missiles, smoke\/obscurant tests, hazard predictions for chemical agent munitions disposal, monitoring dispersion of simulant clouds for chemical\/biological detector tests, simulated nuclear blasts, and weather warnings for test range safety.  Provides technical support to Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at:  White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama;  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK); Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  This program develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army\/DoD RDT&E requirements.  It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement\/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems.  Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel\/weapons developers and project\/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999.  This program is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities."

Provides technical support to Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs), Project Managers (PMs), and the Army test ranges and sites at:  White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico; Electronic Proving Ground (EPG), Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah; Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Redstone Test Center (RTC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama;  Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona (including the Cold Regions Test Center (CRTC), Fort Greely, AK); Operational Test Command (OTC), Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  This program develops methodologies and acquires instrumentation and systems that allow meteorological teams to support current and future Army\/DoD RDT&E requirements.  It finances indirect meteorological support operating costs not billable to customers and replacement\/upgrade of meteorological instrumentation and support systems.  Direct costs for meteorological support services are not funded by this PE, but are borne by the customer (i.e., materiel\/weapons developers and project\/product managers) in accordance with DoD Directive 7000.14R, October 1999.  This program is essential to the accomplishment of the Army's developmental test mission in that precise weather modeling and measurements directly influence test item performance and quantify test item weather dependencies and vulnerabilities."

The primary aim of the program is to maximize the efficiency of research and development for force and materiel development by reducing the uncertainties associated with these threats.  The program also answers general scientific and technical intelligence requirements, provides materiel for realistic testing and training, and aids in the development of countermeasures to threat materiel and technologies.  Operations have increased the amount of captured threat materiel that require immediate exploitation to develop countermeasures and force protection measures for US forces.  Acquisition and exploitation are executed according to Army Foreign Materiel Program (FMP) Plan prioritization and with the approval of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G2)."

These are required to evaluate concepts and address needs and issues that occur in joint military environments and provide information required by Congress, Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Unified Commands, and the Department of Defense components relative to joint operations.  This project also funds Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE), as necessary.  FOTE may be required after a full production decision to assess system training and logistics, to verify correction of deficiencies identified during earlier testing and evaluation, and to ensure that initial production items meet operational effectiveness, suitability and supportability thresholds.  There has been a shift of focus for items funded by this project due to continuing operations in the US Central Command (CENTCOM).  Traditional system workload has dropped off and has been replaced by rapid fielding initiatives.  In response to this shift, the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has established a forward operational assessment team in theater and a rapid response cell.  These groups facilitate MOTE, JT&E, and FOTE events in the rapid environment.  Traditional acquisition requirements are expected to return to normal when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down."

This project finances recurring costs for the Operational Test Command that are essential for conducting realistic and continuous testing in the critical areas of equipment, doctrine, force design and training.  These recurring costs include civilian pay, requirements for test support contracts, temporary duty, supplies and equipment.  This project funds requirements for the Operational Test Command's eight test directorates and one support activity located at Fort Hood, TX; Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Sill, OK\/Ft. Bliss, TX; and Fort Huachuca, AZ. The primary mission of these test directorates is to perform detailed planning, execution, and reporting of Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOTE), and Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDTE). Project V02 currently provides support for the one Test and Evaluation Coordination Offices (TECOs) located at Fort Leonard Wood, MO and one Infantry Support Cell at Fort Benning, GA.  TECOs previously located in Fort Lee, VA and Fort Knox, KY have been consolidated in Fort Benning, GA."

Assigned personnel provide continuous support to materiel and combat developers from the inception of their programs.  The early involvement of LNOs supports the sections of the ATEC Mission Essential Task List (METL) that apply to ongoing contingency operations.  ATEC performance continues to meet 120 day rapid equipping requirement set by the CSA. Liaison officers continue to enable ATEC to sustain rapid, flexible T&E support in the evaluation of Rapid Initiative Systems, Counter IED systems, and Urgent Material Releases.  Effort results in cost savings, cost avoidance and critical design efficiencies being identified early in a system's development, thereby avoiding more expensive product improvement programs later in a system's life cycle.  T&E efficiency gains continue to be realized through early identification of instrumentation, modeling and simulation tools, and other resources needed for testing, as well as making more efficient use of data from developmental testing and experiments."

In support of Army operations, Generating-Force functions and institutional processes, M&SC3I addresses analytical efforts underlying decision making, capability development, and life-cycle costs by capitalizing on M&S technologies (accomplished through collaborative efforts of the training\/operations and acquisition communities).  The RDTE component of M&SC3I encompasses efforts that (1) develop\/improve new\/existing models and simulations to reduce time, resources and risks associated with operational\/institutional decision making and the acquisition process and (2) advance the following disciplines: M&S research, analysis and experimentation; simulation technology; and M&S tools and services.  M&SC3I addresses development of tactics and doctrine, experimentation and exercises, traditional weapon system development, and assessment and transition of advanced technologies to operational capabilities.  The overarching goal of M&SC3I is to reduce time and cost of providing improved capabilities to the war fighter.  Emerging information-age technologies continue to revolutionize the Army's ability to collaborate among all stakeholders using data descriptions, digital representations, and virtual prototypes to improve understanding of required capabilities, shorten procurement time, reduce procurement and sustainment costs, and, ultimately, reduce total life-cycle cost.  M&SC3I advocates the use of advanced technologies to enable future capabilities through improved understanding of operational requirements, collaborative analyses of emerging technologies, and cross-community participation in experiments and exercises.  The following are discussions of efforts under the two projects of PE 0605718.  Under project S03, \"Analysis M&S Tools and Services,\" the Army develops M&S tools and services (e.g., hardware, software, infrastructure) for the Army's analysis community.  The primary users of these tools and services are the Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC), the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA), and the Center for Army Analysis (CAA).  Efforts focus on (1) development of analysis tools that will enable assessment of emerging technologies during concept exploration and (2) development of infrastructure and enabling technologies to support the Current and Future Force.  These critical efforts are required for (1) analysis-of-futures work to justify Army requirements, (2) assessment of alternative approaches to satisfy those requirements, (3) development of current and emerging war fighting doctrine from the tactical to the operational levels of warfare and (4) the closing of capability gaps in the areas of irregular warfare, M&S data and standards, cyberspace operations, army network modeling and non-lethal weapons.  Under project S05, \"Army Simulation Technology (SIMTECH),\" the Army enhances force effectiveness by inducing research organizations on a short-term basis to conduct high-priority, promising simulation research initiatives that are outside the scope of Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) and Army Science and Technology (S&T) programs.  Beginning with FY14, SIMTECH activities fall under the project S03, \"Analysis M&S Tools and Services.\" Project S05 ends with FY13 programs."

It also provides for continued operations of contracting and acquisition management functions performed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the USAMRMC Medical RDTE Program.    \n    \nAdditionally, the USAMRMC is implementing the Medical Research Information Technology System (MeRITS), an electronic data and document-handling system needed to standardize animal and human clinical trial documentation in support of FDA requirements. This system will create centralized storage and access between Headquarters and its five subordinate laboratories.  MeRITS is an integral part of an overall USAMRMC effort to enhance its laboratories performance, efficiency, and accountability and will be integrated in FY11 with minor sustainment cost in FY 2012."

Management of this information is critical to achieve the goals established by the Army's Senior Leadership.  Use of accurate and timely technical information is essential to successfully meeting the milestones required on the path to the future force, allowing Army Science and Technology (S&T) leadership to refine investment strategy and quickly react to emerging opportunities and issues.  This program includes initiatives to improve information derivation, storage, access, display, validation, transmission, distribution, and interpretation; to develop and enhance a single business model for Army S&T knowledge management information technology; to provide for Independent Review Team analysis of technology maturity as part of the Technology Area Readiness Assessment as required by DoDI 5000.2 dated May 12, 2003 as well as the Army Science Board (ASB) (projects 720 and 727).  This program addresses the need to increase the competitiveness and availability of scientific, engineering, and technical skills in the DoD and National workforce through outreach programs aimed at middle school through college students and teachers.  By providing direct working experience for these students in Army laboratories, the programs expose these students to the working world of science and engineering (project 729).  The program includes funding for studies and analyses using behavioral science-based analytic tools to provide policy and decision makers with Soldier-oriented recommendations concerning manpower, personnel, and training issues (project 730).  The program includes funding for support for Army high performance computing centers (project 731).  The program includes funding for improvements to the Army's acquisition process (project 733).  This program supports combatant commanders and major Army commands by providing science advisors to address scientific and technical issues and by providing engineering teams to solve field Army technical problems (project C16).  Finally, this program funds studies by the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) (project C18).  Coordination of this program with the other Services is achieved through inter-service working groups.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, the Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, Arlington, VA, the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), Ft.

Activities are consolidated under the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) which links and networks appropriate components to derive the best synergies to \"present the Army\" a larger pool of technical talent.  Programs  provide students with Army-unique practical experiences at Army laboratories, centers, and institutes; provide incentives for student competitions and support career development opportunities for students.  AEOP increases interest and involvement of students and teachers across the nation in STEM at all proficiency levels and backgrounds to include under-represented and economically disadvantaged groups through exposure to Army sponsored research, education, competitions, internships, and practical experiences.  This project enhances the national pool of science and engineering personnel that in turn supports defense industry and Army laboratory and research, development, and engineering center needs.  Educating the nation's youth in STEM will help ensure a technologically literate citizenry that is required to promote the security and economic competitiveness of the United States. \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.  \n\nWork is performed by the Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Army Research Institute (ARI), the Army Corps of Engineers, Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC), and Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)."

The FAST program provides Science advisers, recruited from Army Materiel Command (AMC) headquarters and all AMC Major Subordinate Commands (MSC) to serve combatant commands and major commands worldwide.  FAST tours of duty provide significant professional growth opportunities for the Army's scientists and engineers and enable them to focus AMC resources on rapidly identifying and solving field technical problems that enable the improvement of readiness, safety, training, and reduce operations and support (O&S) costs.  The FAST activity is supported by Quick Reaction Coordinators within the engineering centers.  The FAST program recoups many times its cost in O&S savings.  FAST also provides emerging technology demonstration opportunities to the engineering centers and executes a biannual Technology Applications Conference (TAC) on a rotating basis between Forces Command, US Army Europe, US Forces Korea\/Eighth Armyassists COCOMS with their annual Science and Technology Conferences.  FAST also maintains close coordination with the Navy Science Advisor Program (Naval Fleet Forces Technology Integration Office).FAST supports warfighters in OEF with embedded Science and Technology Assistance Teams (STATs) as well as Science and Technology Acquisition Corps Advisors (STACAs).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is performed by the US Army Materiel Command (AMC), Ft.

The BAST functions under the auspices of the National Research Council (NRC) an organization within the National Academies of Sciences and provides an external, independent, and objective source of advice to the Army.  The BAST serves as a convening authority for the discussion of science and technology issues of importance to the Army and oversees independent Army-related studies conducted by the National Academies.  Working in close coordination with the Army, the BAST helps define problems, brings together experts to study these problems, and provides recommendations.  Committees are assembled in accordance with established NRC procedures and BAST studies often take 12 months or more to conclude.  \n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secreatary of Defense for Research and Engineering science and technology priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this project is executed extramurally by the Army Research Laboratory, Army Research Office (ARO), Research Triangle Park, NC."

It provides a coordinated tri-service mechanism for the collection and free exchange of technical data on the performance and effectiveness of all non-nuclear conventional munitions and weapons systems in a realistic operational environment.  It provides for NATO interchangeability testing (F21); Joint munition effectiveness manuals used by all services; development of standardization agreements (STANAGS) and associated Manuals of Proof and Inspection (MOPI); operation of the North American Regional Test Center (NARTC); evaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional ammunition (F24); evaluation of useful shelf life, safety, reliability and producibility of pyrotechnic munitions; and improvement of explosives safety criteria for DOD munitions via the DOD Explosives Safety Board (857).  Pyrotechnic Reliability and Safety (296) supports pyrotechnic research, development and testing to identify, characterize and resolve reliability, safety, storage and manufacturing issues that impact production availability and field use of pyrotechnics.  Project 296 will result in the development and demonstration of new, safe, reliable and environmentally acceptable munitions.  Munitions Survivability and Logistics (297) will make Army units more survivable by applying technologies to reduce the sensitivity of munitions to unplanned stimuli (e.g. bullet impacts, fragment impacts, fast cook off, slow cook off, sympathetic detonation, shaped charge jets) and by testing and demonstrating munitions logistics system solutions that prevent or minimize catastrophic explosive events and accelerate ammunition resupply.  Project 297 also supports the Army Insensitive Munitions (IM) Board's reviews.  The Army Explosives Safety Management Program (858) was established in FY01. The U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety uses the funds in this project to evaluate current explosives safety standards and develop new, scientific and risk-based standards to meet U. S. Army explosives requirements.  The Life Cycle Pilot Program (LCPP) (859) will assess production base capabilities and needs over the acquisition life cycle of various munitions and will address the producibility of ammunition including the transition to type classification and production, and the ability of the production base to cost effectively produce quality products on schedule.  The Fuze Technology Integration program (862) will improve performance and lower the costs of existing proximity fuzes and enable new applications in submunitions and medium caliber fuzes, addressing advanced proximity fuze sensor technology, Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS), Safety and Arming (S&A) technology, and Electronic S&A (ESA) technology for smart munitions."

Key thrusts are munitions storage area survivability, Insensitive Munitions (IM) technology integration and compliance, ammunition management and asset visibility, weapon system rearm, munitions configured load enablers and advanced packaging and distribution system enhancements.  Within each thrust, a broad array of solutions will be identified, tested, and evaluated against developed system measures of effectiveness.  Optimum, cost effective solutions that enable the rapid projection of lethal and survivable forces will be demonstrated.  The early stages of force deployment are especially critical.  Theater ammunition storage areas are vulnerable and present the enemy with lucrative targets.  These areas and distribution nodes contain the only available munitions stocks in theater.  Loss of these munitions could cripple the force, jeopardize the mission, and result in high loss of life.  This project mitigates vulnerabilities and ensures a survivable fighting force."

This program will implement these technologies into fuzing systems to preclude obsolescence, maximize standardization, enhance performance, and improve the safety and exportability of existing munitions. The program addresses two major areas: (1) risk mitigation and (2) block upgrades. Risk mitigation efforts will evaluate and demonstrate second sources for fuzing systems that may reduce cost by providing competition, and maintain production when sources or parts are no longer available. It will also allow for the performance enhancement of current ammunition items by conducting studies of major fuze components to detect and identify latent defects. The second major area is block upgrades, which will evaluate and perform studies on improvements to fuzes; increase commonality of fuze components and requirements. Block upgrades will enable the introduction of the latest technologies into fuzing, keep the fuzing design current to avoid obsolescence issues, and add capabilities. \n\nThis program will also identify, mature, and integrate new technologies for enhanced lethality, range extension and standardization to improve target engagement effectiveness; increase reliability, safety, and exportability; and reduce taxpayer costs including elimination of sole source supply of indirect fires ammunition materials as well as studies and evaluations of such technology solutions in comparison to current stock pile indirect fire conventional munitions and their associated production processes. Additionally, environmental impacts of legacy propellants, explosives and metal parts will be studied. Replacement of hazardous materials such as Ammonium Perchlorate, Diphenylamine, Lead, etc. and addition of propellant anti-tubewear additives will remain a focus. This program support the standardization and interoperability of legacy and new production ammunition to maximize munitions battlefield interchangeability\/compatibility between 52 and 39 caliber guns under the auspices of the international Joint Ballistics Memorandum Of Understanding (JBMOU) as well as rifled and smooth-bore mortars. Maximizing standardization, interchangeability, and exportability will potentially increase FMS sales of US products to maintain domestic production and economies of scale."

Funds required to support the management of technology transfer associated with technology demonstrated and validated as part of Army EQT projects are included in this program element.  In addition, support to the Army weapon system acquisition community to address generic pollution prevention related requirements are included under the Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics Program.\n\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Acquisition\/Logistics project includes program management for developing acquisition strategies that both achieve system key performance parameters and sustain the environment without permanent and unacceptable change in the natural environment or human health from system concept refinement through disposal.  It includes systematic consideration of environmental impacts, energy use, natural resources, installation impacts, economics, and quality of life.  It provides support to the system acquisition community, e.g., program and project managers, to integrate environmental quality analyses into the system acquisition process.  The goal is to resolve environmental quality issues related to weapon systems that are identified during design, development, testing, operation, or support to reduce Army environmental liabilities and total ownership costs and includes efforts to eliminate the use of hazardous and ozone-depleting materials from weapon systems and facilities and to ensure the availability of Halon 1301 to support weapon system fire suppression requirements.  \n\nThe Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Clearance project, beginning in FY 2004, is being overseen by the Army.  The project had been overseen by Office of the Secretary of Defense in prior years.  This project funds the Unexploded Ordnance Center of Excellence (UXOCOE) to provide for coordination of unexploded ordnance (UXO) technologies across the Department of Defense."

The early involvement of LNOs supports the sections of the ATEC Mission Essential Task List (METL) that apply to ongoing contingency operations.  ATEC performance continues to meet 120 day rapid equipping requirement set by the CSA. Liaison officers continue to enable ATEC to sustain rapid, flexible T&E support in the evaluation of Rapid Initiative Systems, Counter IED systems, and Urgent Material Releases.  Effort results in cost savings, cost avoidance and critical design efficiencies being identified early in a system's development, thereby avoiding more expensive product improvement programs later in a system's life cycle.  T&E efficiency gains continue to be realized through early identification of instrumentation, modeling and simulation tools, and other resources needed for testing, as well as making more efficient use of data from developmental testing and experiments."

These are required to evaluate concepts and address needs and issues that occur in joint military environments and provides information required by Congress, Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Unified Commands, and the Department of Defense components relative to joint operations.  This project also funds Follow-on Test and Evaluation (FOTE), as necessary.  FOTE may be required after a full production decision to assess system training and logistics, to verify correction of deficiencies identified during earlier testing and evaluation, and to ensure that initial production items meet operational effectiveness, suitability and supportability thresholds.  There has been a shift of focus for items funded by this project due to continuing operations in the US Central Command (CENTCOM).  Traditional system workload has dropped off and has been replaced by rapid fielding initiatives.  In response to this shift, the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has established a forward operational assessment team in theater and a rapid response cell.  These groups facilitate MOTE, JT&E, and FOTE events in the rapid environment.  Traditional acquisition requirements are expected to return to normal when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down."

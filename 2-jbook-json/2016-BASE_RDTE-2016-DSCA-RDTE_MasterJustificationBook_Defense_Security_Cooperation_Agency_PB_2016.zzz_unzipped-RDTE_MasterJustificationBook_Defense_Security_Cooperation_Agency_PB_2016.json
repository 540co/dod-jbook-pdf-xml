The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fostering networks of partner influencers and enabling better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. \n\nThe Regional Centers Person\/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework for the Regional Centers for Security Studies that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  Data updates in GlobalNET and RCPAMS will be shared to ensure data integrity."

The primary focus of the program is a common information technology platform (GlobalNET) to improve international partner outreach and collaboration efforts in a federated environment. A federated environment \u2013 characterized by the capacity of DoD institutions and Partners to directly share participants and content across proprietary community websites - fosters networks of partner influencers and enables better use of DoD resources through collaboration among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, PfP and international partners, other DoD educational institutions and communities as required. The program uses a spiral methodology (making available capabilities as developed), to speed the delivery of open source collaboration technologies the user community. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) oversees execution of the research and development of the GlobalNET effort and its operations, and ensures that the program addresses DoD security cooperation requirements in the context of defense, interagency, and international information sharing and collaboration needs.\n\nThe GlobalNET effort focuses on improving collaboration, supporting outreach efforts, and enabling communication among the Regional Centers for Security Studies, the Combatant Commanders, the DSCA, OUSD (Policy), North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) Military Partnerships Directorate (MPD), the PfP Consortium of Defense Academies, PfP Partner countries, and other designated DoD institutions and communities. It provides DoD and international partner security practitioners a platform to share information, communicate and collaborate, and improve administrative activities. It also provides the ability to form collaborative communities of interest around security issues. GlobalNET facilitates information sharing and knowledge management concepts in accordance with U.S. policy. PIMS, as a part of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, implements the Congressional endorsement for the modernization of Defense capabilities in eligible PfP countries relative to their telecommunications infrastructure.  RIO-PIMS provides allies and partner countries the ability to collaborate in critical cooperative activities that underpin the spirit of the PfP program.  The program supports PfP coalition initiatives through development of distributive collaboration tools to support aspects of U.S. and NATO-approved PfP cooperative activities.  This support is important to achieve the interoperability\/integration outlined in the Guidance for the Employment of the Force.  RIO-PIMS supports internet-based education and collaboration, exercise simulations, and training center requirements. \n\nThe Regional Centers Person\/Activity Management System (RCPAMS) provides an integrated student and activities management framework that was designed to complement the capabilities of the Security Assistance Network (SAN).  The interface between the SAN, RCPAMS, and GlobalNET will provide faculty and students an effective information service to ensure student, activity, and alumni management.  Data will be shared between the systems ensuring improved data integrity."

Users have identified the current workflow built into the system as incomplete and it is required to be extended.  The NATO School uses an open source LMS that we will make available via GlobalNET with single sign \u2013on which they currently lack this gives us economies of scale that can be realized and by using NATO School\u2019s open source LMS which will be less costly than extending the software for this functionality.\n\nCommon access card (CAC) enable the system.  As the system was designed to support foreign nationals, it does not support CAC authentication and with the security requirements and the inclusion of more US citizens, CAC enablement will provide more access control and easier access.\n\nMigrate the technology from an older code base to a newer version.  GlobalNET is at risk for falling two major software releases behind, increasing the lack of supportability and development personnel.  The update will certify all of the extensions and move to the most recent stable version which will reduce security vulnerabilities and make system extensions less costly to perform and maintain\n\nContinue to research the computer human interface (CHI) ensuring it is closer aligned with the consolidated workflow. We continue to refine the interface such that users are finding operations to be easier and more intuitive to perform.\n\nDeploy a native video teleconference (VTC) capability to replace the existing hosted service.  GlobalNET is currently bundled with a loosely coupled Adobe connect system outside of the GlobalNET stack and hosting environment.  The capability would create a native VTC capability inside of the platform allowing much tighter integrations with messaging, file sharing, white boarding, and chatting and reduce the operations and maintenance (O&M) expense of leasing this service.\n\nWork with the existing platform managers to update the GlobalNET implementation to the newest platform stable release - allowing greater functionality and better security across all members of the platform.\n\nExtend the information exchange between the RCPAMS and GlobalNET.

G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace legacy security cooperation systems.  It will provide a comprehensive picture of SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). \n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support strategic and operational planning by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases.  Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source.  G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding. \n\nG-TSCMIS will interface with other DoD systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) and Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM). G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners.  The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020."

G-TSCMIS will consolidate, improve upon, and replace  legacy TSCMIS solutions hosted at over 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Services, Agencies, and Combatant Commands (CCDRs).  It will provide a comprehensive picture of whole-of-government SC activities, and will contribute to planning more effective cooperative security activities to align or meet desired outcomes in support of SC end states.  The program is an evolutionary rapid Information Technology (IT) acquisition pilot program, as described in FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 804, that provides users at every user command with greater capability through several iterations and releases that are developed and implemented over time.  The Department of Navy (DoN) was assigned acquisition lead for the effort by Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF). \n\nG-TSCMIS is a fully interoperable component of Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) and the DoD Joint C2 (JC2) Capability.  The effort will support the strategic planning of CCDRs by providing access to reports of programs, activities, events, funding, assessments, and status of achieving defined end states.  G-TSCMIS will provide visualization, assessment, reporting, and data management throughout the conduct of SC activities planning and execution phases.  Information from the SC activities will be binned by separate SC programs, budget lines\/funding streams, equipment drawdown, etc.  This will enable users at the tactical level to focus on specific programs, participating forces, events, and activities, while users at the strategic level will be able to access summary reports of geographic regions, resource requirements, or total expenditure of funds by source.  G-TSCMIS support to DoD's SC reporting requirements is mandated by federal law for many SC programs and activities.  To adhere to U.S. regulations, G-TSCMIS reports will be tailored to include programs, events, and activities by category, geographical areas, assessments, U.S. staffing levels, and sources of funding. \n\nG-TSCMIS will interface with other systems, such as Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS) and Joint Capability Requirements Manager (JCRM). G-TSCMIS must also be interoperable with the other United States Government (USG) foreign assistance and international cooperation information systems.  G-TSCMIS will allow decision makers and analysts to identify redundant investments, plan more effective engagements, and find gaps and opportunities for building more capable partners.  The program uses multiple, rapidly executed releases of capability beginning with a Milestone B equivalent initial build decision held in Quarter 1 FY 2012, which resulted in approval from the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) to enter the Incremental and Iterative Development and Deployment (IIDD) phase.  The initial releases require defined objectives and mature technology.  Based on analysis of required capabilities and resources, the Program Office is planning on executing G-TSCMIS in five major releases, each with three iterations, across the period of FY 2012-FY 2020."

Once fielded and operational on both NIPR and SIPR, users will access G-TSCMIS over a web browser with information on a centralized server. The development period is planned for FY 2012 through FY 2020. G-TSCMIS contracting used fair opportunity competitive procedures on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MAC for Releases 1 and 2. Barriers to competition were minimized by using performance and functional specifications and equivalent commercial standards.  Releases 3 through 5 will be completed by separate contract(s).  Either another IDIQ MAC or MACs will be used or a new contract or contracts will be created for the final 3 releases."

The JC2 Capability Definition Package produced by JS J6 defines the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) to be met.  JS J6 also approved specific Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance (MOE\/MOP), establishing thresholds and objectives for G-TSCMIS software to meet.  Successful meeting of stated performance objectives in the statement of work, and meeting cost, schedule and performance targets as defined in the G-TSCMIS Acquisition Program Baseline are key metrics for the program.   The use of participating Service Operational Test Agencies to perform operational testing ensures G-TSCMIS meets the performance metrics prior to making the software operational.  Additional statistics based metrics, trouble tickets logged by the Service Desk, operational user feedback and IV&V and Developmental tests validate system performance.\n\nMajor Performers:\nScience Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for Release 1 and 2 software development"

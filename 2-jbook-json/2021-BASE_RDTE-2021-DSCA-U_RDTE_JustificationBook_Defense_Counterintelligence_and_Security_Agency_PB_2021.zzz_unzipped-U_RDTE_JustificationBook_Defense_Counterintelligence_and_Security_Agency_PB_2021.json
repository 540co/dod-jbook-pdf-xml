These requirements consist of enhancements to Key Management Personnel (KMP) monitoring, NATO Control Point Inspection Triage Outreach Program, NISP Oversight Report, Outgoing Foreign Visits and enabling Industry with the ability to initiate Facility Profile updates.  A separate, parallel development effort will facilitate a SIPR NISS baseline consisting of an alternative Single Sign-On (SSO) capability to National Industrial Security Program (NISP) Central Access Information Security System (NCAISS), as well as Cross Domain Solution (CDS) for movement of NIPR-based data to SIPR for subsequent reporting and data aggregation. Development activities will include interface work between NISS and the Defense Information System for Security (DISS), NISP Contracts Classification System (NCCS) and Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) systems as well as initial planning for refactoring of NISS functionality into National Background Investigative Services (NBIS). Achievement of Full Operational Capability (FOC) delayed due to the of the Period of Performance (PoP)2 which is scheduled for a March 2020 completion.  \n\nThe Adaptive Data Exchange (ADX)\/ Joint Cyber Intelligence Tool Suite (JCITS) will assist DCSA with analysis of network telemetry data gathered from the JCITS unclassified cyber threat intelligence data, cleared contractor reporting and other government agency feeds for detecting anomalous behavior and enhancing data.\n\nThe Defense Information System for Security (DISS) which transfers to DCSA from DHRA\/ DMDC beginning FY2021 is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community. This will provide comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contrators including the technology and processes to implement Continuous Evaluation."

NISS provides a centralized web-based platform for National Industrial Security Program (NISP) personnel to manage the industrial security facility clearance process; from request initiation to approval (or rejection) storage of all associated data, and provides a centralized process for users to submit, update, search, and view facility verification requests.    \n\nNational Contract Classification System (NCCS).  NCCS is a web-based system that automates the DD Form 254 for contract security classification specification submission; provides submitter with intuitive form of instructions, drop-down selections, and linkage to relevant contract information for completing the form; and provides user access control, query\/search, notification, tracking, and reporting capabilities for accountability of all contract security classification specifications. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires a DD Form 254 for each classified contract, and the National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM)(4-103a) requires a DD 254 be issued by the government with each Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quote. The DD Form 254 provides contractor (or a subcontractor) the security requirements and classification guidance necessary to perform on a classified contract. Contract Security Classification Specification required by DoD 5220.22-4, Industrial Security Regulation and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) is to develop a federated system for the oversight and management of classified information access and guidance to perform on classified contracts. The DD 254, an underlying business process, is critical to ensure access to our Nation\u2019s classified information is safeguarded.\n\nNational Industrial Security Program (NISP) DCSA NISP Central Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) a web-based Identity Management (IdM) enterprise portal, PKI compliant point-of-entry to the suite of services offered by DCSA, which controls user service accessibility through single sign-on authentication. User service-level permissions are verified, and authorized services are offered accordingly. Control Access and Information Security System (NCAISS) formerly known as Identity Management (IdM).  NCAISS is mandatory for compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Program Management Office and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD-NII), Joint Task Force for Global Networks Operations (JTF-GNO) Communications Tasking Order (CTO) 06-02, CTO 07-015, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo 11-11 (M-11-11), which directed accelerated use of PKI access across the enterprise.  This initiative is designed to enable multiple DCSA business systems to have service-accessibility that is controlled through PKI-compliant single sign-on authentication.  Potential expanded use of the NCAISS across the DCSA enterprise to provide CAC-based authentication for business support applications to support the SIPRNet and JWICS domains, provide enhanced identity and access control analytics. It incorporates any remaining DCSA operated application into the DcSA NCAISS solution.\n\nDCSA is establishing a Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) program for industry that requires development and implementation of tools that support integration with cybersecurity monitoring, threat indications and\nwarning, and supply chain illumination to protect critical technology. The development of a Security Rating Score (SRS) and its integration with the Contract Performance Assessment System will inform defense acquisition\ndecisions and prioritize DCSA Industrial Security with active monitoring of companies in a single system of record. Funding will purchase data licenses for supply chain illumination tools that can be integrated into CUI\ncybersecurity assessments and will include business process tools to integrate data and manage DCSA business unit inputs from industrial and personnel security inputs. Funds will also support use of Artificial\nIntelligence \/ Machine Learning to accelerate and enhance cyber I&W via predictive analytics.\n\nThe Defense Information System for Security (DISS) is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community to provide comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians, and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation."

DoD assumed modernization efforts beginning in FY 2017, as decided by the Interagency Deputies Committee and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Funds support the development, sustainment, technical refresh of hardware and software, Cloud migration, and program management costs to develop and field a modernized Federal Investigation System. This modernized capability's data architecture will leverage and extend the existing secure Information Technology capabilities inherent to DoD infrastructure to the federal wide background investigation processes and data archives. This approach will provide essential security of this information and in turn protect the identities, lives, and livelihoods of these people, and the family members and associates identified as part of these records. The aim is to avert or eliminate the continuous and dynamic threat of identity theft, financial espionage and other attacks on this personal information, while providing a secure basis for background investigations necessary to Federal and DoD operations.\nUsing proven data architecture and identifiable security, DCSA will leverage critical and inherent information technology (IT) security capabilities; identify means and methods to efficiently and securely access digital services; enhance systems necessary to operate the background investigation processes and associated vast reservoirs of data and interfaces; provide Government-wide tools to assist agencies with workforce management; and, develop and provide investigative products that comply with the new, Federal Investigations Standards and Workforce 2.0. Resources will be used to implement and sustain agency network upgrades and security software maintenance to ensure a stronger, more reliable, and better protected network architecture for conducting background investigations. Costs include program management activities, payroll for security specialists, engineers, data architects, and business process management activities to develop, test, and deploy the new capability. As capabilities are fielded NBIS and DCSA will provide system maintenance, security licenses and operational support to the system and users worldwide."

NBIS will leverage programmatic, operations and support contracts to provide Program Control, Financial and Budget support as well as the Operations functions to support the Cloud environment and transition of existing and new services into the Gov Cloud environments. NBIS will provide travel, non-centralized training, credit card, supplies, new laptops, Joint Enterprise Licensing Agreement (JELA) costs, and common licensing costs that supports running a PEO and Program Office. Finally, in FY2021 NBIS will pay any residual moving costs required for the transition from the DISA campus to a DCSA facility. Additionally, under Budget Authority (BA) 8, the previous BA4 funds will be capitalized to offset the shortfalls in the previous BA7 funds to continue development of the evolving Investigation Services.\n\n\nFY 2021 RDT&E Plans: $38.500\nDoD will continue to develop, enhance and improve the capabilities. As part of an Agile development process, the National Background Investigation System (NBIS) will deploy additional releases in FY21 to improve automation of the background investigation process, improve analytics to address insider threat analysis, improve continuous evaluation capabilities, and develop capabilities to meet additional Federal Agency requirements (e.g., Trusted Workforce 2.0). The system will continue to defend against cyber-attacks and improve defensibility by meeting new and evolving threats. Specifically, NBIS will continue to support Investigation Management (IM) Development for automation, new models, rules engines, and algorithms for optimization of assignments (i.e., continuous development); continue evolving the automation of IT infrastructure and DevSecOps tools and processes; implement Security Enterprise Architecture and Data Services to develop the capability to re-use data and analytics across multiple security missions, all while, simplifying system security and user access; supporting business transformation and late-derived requirements, technology change management, and Tier support for the NBIS Customers; identifying, developing, and testing multiple prototype efforts; and continuing to evolve and execute the adjusted implementation strategy based on lessons learned from prototype efforts and results of independent assessments."

This program supports fundamental broad-based scientific and engineering research in areas critical to Air Force weapon, sensor, and support systems. All research areas are subject to long-range planning and technical review by both Air Force and tri-Service scientific planning groups. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 0602298F, and 1206601SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

Research topics include, but are not limited to, transformational and high priority technologies such as nanotechnology, sensor networks, artificial intelligence and information fusion, smart materials and structures, quantum materials and processes for sensing, communication and computing, efficient energy and power conversion, and high-energy materials for propulsion and control. The program also enhances and promotes the education of U.S. scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to maintaining, advancing, and enabling future U.S. defense technologies. For example, the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) program awards fellowships to train U.S citizens in science and engineering disciplines of military importance under a joint tri-Service and Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering competitive scholarship program. Finally, this program assists universities in establishing superior instrumentation capabilities needed to improve the quality of defense-related research and education. A fundamental component of this program is the recognition that future technologies and technology exploitations require highly coordinated and concerted multi- and inter-disciplinary efforts. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 0602298F and 1206601SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

This program funds multi-disciplinary research institutes to conduct research on laser, laser beam control and high power microwave technologies.  In addition, this program supports educational grants to stimulate student interest in directed energy and encourage graduate research in topics related to high energy lasers and high power microwaves.  These educational grants are used for educational tools, scholarships, and summer intern employees in military laboratories.  Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 615097 is renamed from High Energy Research Initiatives to Joint Directed Energy Basic Research. This project name change reflects the direction in the 2017 and 2018 National Defense Authorization Acts. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 1, Basic Research because this budget activity includes scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs."

Materials for protection of aircrews, sensors, and aircraft from laser, and high-power microwave directed energy threats are also developed. Electronic and optical materials are being developed to enable surveillance and situational awareness with faster operating speeds, greater tunability, higher power output, improved thermal management (including higher operating temperatures), greater sensitivity, and extended dynamic range. New materials are being developed to counter the most prominent laser threats and to respond to emerging and agile threat wavelengths without impairing mission effectiveness. The project develops nanostructured and biological materials for aircraft structures, munitions, air vehicle subsystems, and personnel. The project develops novel materials for electromagnetic interactions with matter for electromagnetic pulse, high power microwave, and lightning strike protection."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion\nindustry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD). Technologies under this project enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tasks include: modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance tasks could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All thrusts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) collaboration and are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and progress towards RP21 Goals. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0602203F, Aerospace Propulsion, Project 624847 , Rocket Propulsion Technology, is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

This research addresses fundamental physical principles, as well as the biophysical interaction between directed energy and the individual or groups of individuals. Research is divided into two core focus areas: novel directed energy bioeffects and mechanisms and directed energy modeling, simulation, and analysis. The research enhances combat survivability and systems effectiveness through technologies that enable deployed forces to counter optical threats and exploit optical systems for offensive applications. In addition, basic biological investigations into the mechanisms associated with high peak power and high average power RF exposure allow for the exploitation of directed energy systems for offensive capabilities while protecting the warfighter from adversarial use of RF technologies. The novel directed energy bioeffects mechanisms research examines the physical, physiological, and neural interactions of EM with tissues to understand dose-response effects as well as reveal the means to cause or prevent a specific effect.  The directed energy modeling, simulation, and analysis research is focused on new software components that represent and optimize concepts of directed energy system employment from the Airman standpoint.  These components are matured for future transition and application for engagement-to-mission level simulations in which directed energy weapons are employed."

Analytical and experimental areas of emphasis are propellants, propellant management, combustion, rocket material applications, technology for sustainment of strategic systems, and innovative space propulsion concepts. Technologies of interest will improve reliability, performance, survivability, affordability, and environmental compatibility of these systems. Develop technologies to reduce the weight and cost of components using new materials and improved designs and manufacturing techniques. All efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD). Technologies under this project enable capabilities of interest to both DoD and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Tasks include: modeling and simulation; proof of concept tests of critical components; advanced component development; and ground-based tests. Aging and surveillance tasks could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by 50%, enabling motor replacement for cause. All thrusts are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) collaboration and are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee yearly for relevance to DoD missions and progress towards RP21 Goals.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technology is transferred to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 624847, Rocket Propulsion Technologies in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Advances in aerospace sensors are required to increase combat effectiveness by providing anytime, anywhere surveillance, reconnaissance, precision targeting, and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities. To achieve this progress, this program pursues simultaneous advances in: 1) generating, controlling, receiving, and processing electronic and photonic signals for radio frequency (RF) sensor aerospace applications; 2) electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) aerospace sensor technologies for a variety of offensive and defensive uses; 3) radio frequency antennas and associated electronics for airborne and space surveillance, together with active and passive electro-optical\/infrared sensors; 4) technologies to manage and fuse on-board sensor information for timely, comprehensive situational awareness; 5) technology for affordable, trusted, and reliable, all-weather surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike radio frequency sensors and electronic combat systems; and 6) technologies that aid in the development of agile and resilient mission systems. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

This project also develops and evaluates technology for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors, fire control radars, electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and offensive information operations systems.  It emphasizes the detection and tracking of surface and airborne targets with radio frequency signatures that are difficult to detect due to reduced radar cross sections, concealment and camouflage measures, severe clutter, or heavy jamming.  Techniques exploited include the use of multiple radio frequency phenomenologies, multi-dimensional adaptive processing, advanced waveforms and knowledge-aided processing techniques. This project also develops concepts to counter threats to our aerospace systems. It develops and evaluates technology for electronic warfare, integrated radar and electronic warfare systems, and electro-optical\/infrared seeker defeat. This project develops the radio frequency warning and countermeasure technology for advanced electronic warfare and information operations applications. The project also explores technologies to maintain a military advantage in positioning, navigation and timing integrity, accuracy, and resiliency."

Air Force has a comprehensive and deliberative planning process to identify and fund research that is expected to have the greatest benefit to the Air Force and the warfighter.  10 U.S.C. Section 2363 provides the Commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in consultation with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Executive, a degree of flexibility to rapidly exploit scientific breakthroughs or respond to emerging threats, to include developing a skilled workforce and necessary infrastructure.  This flexibility increases the rate of innovation and accelerates the development and fielding of needed military capabilities to address current and future problems.  \n\nThe Air Force has established PE 0602212F, where the 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funds are internally reprogrammed to this program element in the year of execution after receipt of the appropriation. This allows increased transparency to Congress on 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 funding and additional execution flexibility for 10 U.S.C. Section 2363 activities to cross all technology areas.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

The effort supports core technical competencies of fuze technology; energetic materials; damage mechanisms; munitions aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, and control; terminal seeker sciences; and munition systems effects.  Technologies to be developed include blast, fragmentation, penetrating and low-collateral damage war-heads, hard-target fuzing, precise terminal guidance, and high-performance and insensitive explosives.  \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Laser research includes moderate to high power laser devices that are applicable to a wide range of applications, optical technologies to propagate laser beams through the atmosphere, and integration of these technologies into demonstration packages.  Space Situational Awareness research uses the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) and the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) to develop and implement technologies to identify visual characteristics such as status and health of orbiting space objects.  In high power microwaves this research examines technologies for applications such as counter-electronics and non-lethal weapons. This program conducts research into other novel Directed Energy applications; conducts Directed Energy vulnerability\/lethality assessments; develops protection technologies versus Directed Energy; conducts research into other advanced non-conventional\/innovative weapons; develops and uses tools to compare solutions to determine the most effective and efficient Directed Energy technologies to meet Air Force needs; coordinates efforts through the Department of Defense Science and Technology  Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Advances in enterprise-centric information technologies are required to increase warfighter readiness and effectiveness by providing the right information, at the right time, in the right format, anytime, anywhere in the world. The Connectivity and Protection Tech project provides the technologies for multi-level, secure, seamless networks; advanced communications processors; anti-jam and low probability of intercept techniques, as well as technologies that deter any adversary from attacking computer systems while allowing access to, presence on, manipulation of, and operational effects on adversary computer systems. This project also develops the technology base for the next generation of ultra-wide-bandwidth, multi-channeled, air- and space-based communications networks. The Information Management and Computational Tech project provides advances in information management and dissemination technologies to ensure the delivery of high-quality, timely, secure information to the warfighter, and develop technologies to produce both advanced on demand computational processing and computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by Air Force systems. The Information Decision Making Tech project develops the technology to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations. The Operational Awareness Tech project develops technologies that improve their capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information. The Research Site Support project provides the Rome Research Site infrastructure at Rome, New York and provides for the continued operations of all Rome Research Site properties, buildings, and services necessary for the research mission. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication. \n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech, and Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0622041F, 0602605F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

In addition, it develops both the technology base for ultra-wide bandwidth and multi-channeled communications networks (both air and space based) on and between platforms.\n\nThis project provides the technologies which enable the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.\n\nThis project advances technologies enabling the effective execution of military objectives that will vastly improve the ability to support the commander and staff's ability to command all viable options to achieve desired effects across the full spectrum of operations (air, space, and cyberspace) at all levels of war (strategic, operational, and tactical) and during all phases of conflict. This project provides technologies for anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.\n\nThis project improves and automates the capability to generate, process, manage, fuse, exploit, interpret, and disseminate timely and accurate information.  This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech, and Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

Technology development in this project must be capable of taking advantage of future net-centric environments including new structured and ad hoc processes in response to rapidly changing warfare challenges.  Advances in robust information management focus on quality of service and flow of information within the enterprise, information transformation and brokering, secure information sharing across and among domains, and collaboration of workflow within the enterprise.  Technologies addressed in this project include the ability to globally share, discover, and access information across organizational, functional, and coalition boundaries and between and among domains, the timely delivery of information to tactical assets, the tailoring and prioritization of  information based on mission needs and importance, and the scaling, robustness, and collaboration features required of the Air Force net-centric information management environment.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625316, Info Mgt and Computational Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

Technology development in this project includes anticipatory decision support; course of action development, planning, scheduling, and assessment; and the real-time effective portrayal of complex data sets.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on the capability to maximize the value, sharing, management, and use of information and information assets in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625317, Information Decision Making Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

This project provides not only a network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capability that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence and sensor sources to provide timely situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace, but also the advanced, novel exploitation technologies needed to intercept, collect, locate, and process both covert and overt raw data from intelligence and sensor sources.  It leads the research, discovery, and development of technology that enables the fusion of multi-intelligence sources to provide accurate object tracking and identification, situational awareness, understanding, and anticipation of the threats in the battlespace (air, ground, space, and cyber).  It also leads in the development of advanced exploitation technologies to maximize the intelligence gained from our adversaries in the areas of spectral detection and geolocation, signal recognition and analysis, and the data tagging, tracking, and tracing via the insertion of secure, imperceptible signal embedding for future fusion and understanding of the information.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires dynamic and elastic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance forces and capabilities to provide actionable intelligence to commanders and to increase understanding of the environment and an adversary's capabilities and intentions.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 625318, Operational Awareness Tech efforts transferred to Project 625315, C4I Dominance Technology, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

This program is part of an overall Department of Defense Directed Energy Science and Technology program. Directed Energy weapon systems have many potential advantages including speed of-light delivery, low collateral damage, significant magazine depth, low incremental cost per kill. Directed Energy Weapon Systems have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions including high value asset and base protection, precision strike and platform self-protection versus a wide variety of missile, rocket, artillery, mortar and air platforms. Efforts under this program are generally chosen for their potential to have an impact on multiple Directed Energy Weapon systems and multiple Service missions while complementing Service\/Agency efforts that are directed at specific Service needs. A broad range of technologies are addressed in key areas such as laser sources, microwave sources, laser beam control, antennas, waveguides, modeling and simulation, and lethality mechanisms. This program provides the enabling technology necessary to demonstrate advanced concepts for high power microwave sources, antennas and waveguides for mission areas not considered to date. The high power microwave lethality, hardware and software improvements and modeling and simulation advances provided by this program are essential to expand and build upon current architectures. This program supports the Senior Official as required. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

First, the space survivability and surveillance area develops technologies to understand space weather and the geophysics environment for mitigation and exploitation of these effects to Air Force systems. Second, the spacecraft payload technologies area improves satellite payload operations by developing advanced component and subsystem capabilities. Third, the spacecraft protection area develops technologies for protecting United States space assets in potential hostile settings. The last major area, spacecraft vehicles, focuses on spacecraft platform and control technologies, and their interactions. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602298F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, and 1206601SF.\n\nThis work will still be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles (AFRL\/RV) Technology Directorate located at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. This is an administrative realignment and not a New Start.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 2, Applied Research because this budget activity includes studies, investigations, and non-system specific technology efforts directed toward general military needs with a view toward developing and evaluating the feasibility and practicality of proposed solutions and determining their parameters."

Advances to technologies and materials under this program reduce life cycle costs; ensure the industrial base for Air Force systems; boost quality, increase readiness, and improve safety, survivability, and operability of weapon systems; predict, evaluate, and mitigate bioeffects on personnel and mission performance; and enable airmen performance.  \n\nTo the greatest extent practical, integrated technology demonstrations will utilize modeling and simulation, cross-discipline system integration (e.g., platforms, avionics, propulsion, materials, manufacturing, human performance, cybersecurity, and counter directed energy weapons) to demonstrate in a near-operational environment advanced science and technology capabilities that reduce operational risk and accelerate incorporation of technologies into existing and future operational systems.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603112F, Advanced Materials for Weapon Systems, and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, with the exception of the Pervasive and Affordable Metals Technologies effort which will be transferred to PE 0602102F, Materials, Project 624347, Materials for Structures, Propulsion, and Subsystems.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technology (S&T), and associated Projects\/activities are transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603680F, Manufacturing Technology Program, and associated Projects\/Activities are transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters; and Project 635324, Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration, are transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 060303F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos. \n\nThese transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. \n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining  mission readiness and capability. This program develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system\/fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. This program also develops and demonstrates affordable advanced composites for aircraft structures of fielded and emerging systems.  This includes studies, analysis, and tests for application of composites to address sustainment and affordability issues across the force. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635351, Technology Sustainment, is transferred from PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technology (S&T), to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, Project 635351, Technology Sustainment, as part of the Air Force RDT&EBA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Vanguard programs will advance and accelerate emerging weapon systems and warfighting concepts in the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) portfolio, while demonstrating the viability of leap-ahead capabilities. High risk by design, their goal answers specific questions and informs future decisions by including the direction of future acquisition programs and identifying gaps where more research is still needed. \n\nThese programs are Air Force priority initiatives with enterprise commitment that incorporate multidisciplinary solutions for delivering transformational capabilities through the Air Force Capability Development Council (CDC), co-chaired by the Under Secretary of the Air Force and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, owns the annual Vanguard approval process. The Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability (AFWIC), chartered to develop the Air Force future force design, leads activities that identify and recommend Vanguard candidates that could provide transformational capability. \n\nThe first three Air Force Vanguard programs are Golden Horde, Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3), and Skyborg. Golden Horde will demonstrate collaborative autonomous networked weapons that share data, interact and execute coordinated actions, and work together to defeat targets. NTS-3 will experiment on key aspects for new GPS receivers that incorporate multiple signals and readily adapt to warfighter needs. The first iteration of Skyborg will integrate artificial intelligence into autonomous unmanned air vehicles to enable future manned-unmanned teaming.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the Air Force created PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards, to consolidate Vanguard and Future Transformational Capabilities efforts and funding in order to better align with the Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019, and execute transformational Advanced Technology Development. This PE creation and realignment of funding from existing Air Force RDT&E Advanced Technology Development PEs is an administrative realignment and not a new start. These efforts and activities continued to be managed by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer (TEO), dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorate locations.\n\nThis PE may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in PEs 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of 633834, Integrated Space Technology Demonstrations, is transferred from PE 0603401F, Advanced Spacecraft Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, with the exception of the work and funding that is associated with the Navigation Technology Satellite-3 Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to the PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63682J, Spacecraft Vehicles, is transferred from PE 0603401F, Advanced Spacecraft Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634920, Flight Vehicle Tech Integration, is transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, with the exception of the work and funding associated with the Skyborg Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to thePE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634926, High Speed\/Hypersonic Integration & Demonstrations, is transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.\n\nIn FY 2021,the entirety of Project 634927, Flight Systems Control, is transferred from PE  0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, Project 634927, Flight Systems Control, with the exception of the work and funding associated with the Skyborg Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to the PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration, is transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, with the exception of funding associated with Skyborg Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to the PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633035, Aerospace Power Technology; Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator; Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion; and Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, are transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. \n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, Non-Vanguard efforts and activities are transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated Non-Vanguard efforts and activities will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson, OH. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances in this project could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance thrusts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The efforts in this project are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The efforts in this project are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion, is transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Edwards AFB, CA. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, is transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and\/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aircraft Propulsion Subsystem Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, is transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo, Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, as part of the Air Force RDT&E, BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

This program develops multi-domain battlespace awareness capabilities through advanced aerospace sensors\/signals and exploitation algorithms, counter-countermeasures, advanced data handling, multi-domain fusion techniques\/visualization, secure net-enabled architectures and communications\/networks, and operation\/upgrade of the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS). This program develops training, simulation, mission rehearsal and other Airman performance-aiding methods including adaptive Airman-machine\/interface teaming and multisensory fusion. This program develops electronic and cyber warfare capabilities including trusted sensors\/systems, cyber susceptibility discovery and mitigation, and cyber protection\/resiliency. \n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the Secretary of the Air Force in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021,the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603444F, Maui Space Surveillance Systems, and the associated Project\/activities are transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635325, Mission Effective Performance is transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech. \n\nIn FY 2021, non-Vanguard efforts and activities in Project 635327, Warfighter Interfaces, are transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, and the associated Projects are transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. \n\nThe Air Force Science and Technology portfolio will continued to be managed at the Enterprise level by the Air Force Technology Executive Officer, dual-hatted as the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Commander, and executed across the various AFRL Technology Directorates and locations. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 0602298F, and 1206601SF.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It is designed to apply developed vulnerability discovery, vulnerability mitigation, and cyber protection technology to avionics systems and components and embedded systems. This involves technologies for trusted sensors and trusted systems that deter exploitation of our critical hardware and software. This project aims to develop cyber resilience and protect systems through adaptation of the system to the threat.  It demonstrates these technologies in open and adaptable architectures for system integration in field demonstrations and proves out the technologies through rapid integration of sensors and architectures for technology transition. It integrates research efforts in electronic and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE Consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn order to achieve operational agility, the Air Force must be able (a) to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations at all levels of war and during all phases of conflict; (b) to field advanced, secure, net-enabled architectures and communications\/network technologies in support of persistent, global, and survivable kinetic and non-kinetic military operations; (c) to process and exploit data and information from a variety of sources and domains to create a common operating picture of the battlespace; and (d) to provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed Air Operations Center, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular Communities of Interest (COI).\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA03 PE Consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

It provides aerospace platforms with the capability to precisely detect, track, and target both airborne (conventional and low radar cross-section) and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets in adverse clutter and jamming environments.  Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology is transferred from PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech, Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located at Wright Patterson Air Base, Ohio.

The research addresses technologies for missile\/threat warning, radio frequency receivers, electronic combat pre-processors, advanced sorting\/pre-processing algorithms, and expert software for applications on existing and future electronic combat systems. The research also focuses on the development and demonstration of subsystems and components for generating on-board\/off-board radio frequency countermeasure techniques. This includes the development of electronic countermeasures techniques, as well as advanced electronic countermeasures technologies such as antennas, power amplifiers, and preamplifiers.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasures Tech, is transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasures Tech with the exception of the work and funding that is associated with the Navigation Technology Satellite-3 Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to PE 0603032F, Future Air Force Integrated Tech Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards. These transfers are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE Consolidation in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Operating Concept and AF Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and non-Vanguard associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

This project develops the ability to deliver cyber-attack capabilities (access, stealth, persistence, intelligence, and weapons delivery), cyber defense capabilities (attack detection, attack attribution, and response automation) and cyber support capabilities (situation awareness and war gaming). This project will also develop 1) a science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation, 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed and embedded computing systems, and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, and complex software-intensive systems.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on cyber technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, is transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

These projects ensure the Air Force weapon systems are ready and able when needed.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, PE 0603112F, Advanced Materials for Weapon Systems and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F,0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

Technologies matured and demonstrated impact affordability and availability of fielded aerospace weapon systems by reducing sustainment costs, extending service life, and maintaining  mission readiness and capability. This program develops and demonstrates maintenance, life cycle management, and system\/fleet decision making technologies that can be implemented to address operational sustainment issues and could influence future system sustainability decisions via risk reduction to support inclusion into new systems. Studies are conducted to analyze processes and methodologies for application of technologies to address sustainment issues across the force, identifying cross cutting applications for fielded systems, and opportunities for building in sustainability into future applications. This program also develops and demonstrates affordable advanced composites for aircraft structures of fielded and emerging systems.  This includes studies, analysis, and tests for application of composites to address sustainment and affordability issues across the force. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603199F, Sustainment Science and Technologies (S&T), and associated Project will be transferred to PE 0603030F, Air Force Foundational Development\/Demos, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It also develops and demonstrates radio frequency (RF) and electro-optical (EO) sensors for detecting, locating, and targeting airborne, fixed, and time-critical mobile ground targets obscured by natural or man-made means. This program develops the means to find, fix, target, track, and engage air and ground targets anytime, anywhere, and in any weather. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603203F, Advanced Aerospace Sensors, and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. \n \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It provides aerospace platforms with the capability to precisely detect, track, and target both airborne (conventional and low radar cross-section) and ground-based, high-value, time-critical targets in adverse clutter and jamming environments.  Project activities include developing multi-function radio-frequency systems including radar and electronic warfare technology and the position and timing information to enable distributed sensing.  Desired warfighting capabilities include the ability to detect concealed targets in difficult background conditions.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project  63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, will be transferred to Program Element 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 63665A, Advanced Aerospace Sensors Technology, as part of the Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

This effort integrates and demonstrates advanced flight vehicle technologies that improve the performance and supportability of existing and future aerospace vehicles. System level integration brings together aerospace vehicle technologies along with avionics, propulsion, and weapon systems for demonstration in a near-realistic operational environment. Integration and technology demonstrations reduce the risk and time required to transition technologies into operational aircraft. Projects in this program have been coordinated through the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634920, Flight Vehicle Tech Integration, and Project 634927, Aerospace Power & Flight Control Integ & Demo, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under these Projects will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634926, High Speed Systems Integ & Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603211F, Aerospace Technology Dev\/Demo, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The program has six projects, each focusing on technologies with a high potential to enhance the performance of existing and future Air Force weapon systems.  The Aerospace Fuels project develops and demonstrates improved hydrocarbon fuels and advanced propulsion systems, including those for air-breathing, high-speed\/hypersonic flight.  The Aerospace Power Technology project develops and demonstrates adaptive power and thermal management components, controls, and systems for high-power payloads and aircraft as part of energy-optimized aircraft development.  The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project develops demonstrator engines by integrating the engine cores demonstrated in the Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project with low-pressure components.   The Space and Missile Rocket Propulsion project develops and demonstrates innovative rocket propulsion technologies, propellants, and manufacturing techniques.  The Advanced Aerospace Propulsion project develops the scramjet propulsion cycle to a technology readiness level appropriate for in-flight demonstration and for full integration with other engine cycles (including turbine and rocket based).  The Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator project develops and demonstrates core turbine engine technologies for current and future aircraft propulsion systems.\n\nPortions of the Aerospace Fuels, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration, and Advanced Turbine Gas Generator  projects support adaptive cycle technology demonstrations, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nProjects in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2021, the efforts and activities under Project 632480, Aerospace Fuels, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology, in order to consolidate Aerospace Fuel research for increased transparency for Congress.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633035, Aerospace Power Technology; Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion; Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, and Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion Subsystems Int, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platforms Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in either Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio or Edwards Air Force Base, California. \n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The advanced fuel emphasis is on demonstrating new thermally stable, high-heat sink, and controlled chemically reacting fuels for a conventional turbine engine, turbine-based combined cycle engines, and other advanced propulsion systems. The project also evaluates and demonstrates fuel system components that minimize cost, reduce maintenance, and improve performance of future aerospace systems. The advanced propulsion emphasis is on demonstrating concepts for combined cycle, ramjet, and scramjet engines. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies. This project develops component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the efforts and activities under Project 632480, Aerospace Fuels, will be transferred from PE 06030216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology to PE 0602201F, Aerospace Vehicle Technologies, Project 625330, Aerospace Fuel Technology to consolidate the Aerospace Fuels research increasing the transparency for Congress.  The transferred efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration (APSI) project includes demonstrator engines for manned systems and efficient small-scale propulsion for remotely piloted aircraft and cruise missile applications. The demonstrator engines integrate the core (high- pressure spool) technology developed under the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) project with the engine (low-pressure spool) technology such as fans, turbines, engine controls, mechanical systems, exhaust nozzles, and augmentors. Additionally, this project includes activities to improve propulsion safety and readiness. This project also focuses on integration of inlets, nozzles, engine-to-airframe compatibility, and power and thermal management subsystems technologies. The APSI project provides aircraft with potential for longer range and higher cruise speeds with lower specific fuel consumption, surge power for successful engagements, high sortie rates with reduced maintenance, reduced life cycle cost, and improved survivability, resulting in increased mission effectiveness. Technologies developed are applicable to sustained high-speed vehicles and responsive space launch. The Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Integration project is focused on improving propulsion capabilities while at the same time reducing the cost of ownership. Anticipated technology advances include turbine engine improvements providing approximately twice the range for a sustained supersonic combat aircraft, doubling the time on station with ten times the power output for surveillance aircraft and propulsion for a high speed supersonic missile with double the range for time sensitive targets. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, high power extraction, integrated thermal management, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 634921, Aircraft Propulsion Subsystems Int, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Dev\/Demo.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion and Power Technology, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards. These transfers are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated Non-Vanguard efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

Additionally, this project develops technologies for the sustainment of strategic systems (including solid rocket motor boosters and missile propulsion, post boost control, and aging and surveillance efforts) and tactical rockets. Characteristics such as environmental acceptability, affordability, reliability, responsiveness, reduced weight, and reduced operation and launch costs are emphasized. Increased life and performance of propulsion systems are key goals. Technology areas investigated include ground demonstrations of compact, lightweight, advanced propulsion technologies, higher efficiency energy conversion systems (derived from an improved understanding of combustion fundamentals), and high-energy propellants. Technological advances in this project could improve the performance of expendable payload capabilities by approximately twenty to fifty percent and reduce launch, operations, and support costs by approximately thirty percent. Responsiveness and operability of propulsion systems will be enhanced for reusable launch systems. Aging and surveillance thrusts for solid rocket motors could reduce lifetime prediction uncertainties for individual motors by fifty percent, enabling motor replacement for cause. The efforts in this project contribute to the sustainment of the rocket propulsion industry, providing rocket propulsion technology for the entire Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The efforts in this project are part of the Rocket Propulsion 21 (RP21) program. The efforts in this project are reviewed by a DoD level steering committee annually for relevance to DoD missions and achievement of technical goals defined by the RP21 program.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 634922, Space & Missile Rocket Propulsion, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Edwards Air Force Base, California. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

The primary focus is on the hydrocarbon- fueled, scramjet engine. Multi-cycle engines will provide the propulsion systems for possible application to support aircraft and weapon platforms operating up to Mach 7. Efforts include: scramjet flow-path optimization to enable operation over the widest possible range of Mach numbers; active combustion control to assure continuous positive thrust (even during mode transition); robust flame-holding to maintain stability through flow distortions; and maximized volume-to-surface area to minimize the thermal load imposed by the high-speed engine. Thermal management plays a vital role in scramjet and combined cycle engines, including considerations for protecting low speed propulsion systems (e.g., turbine engines) during hypersonic flight.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 635098, Advanced Aerospace Propulsion, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

The objective is to provide continuous evolution of technologies into an advanced gas generator in which the performance, cost, durability, repairability, and maintainability can be assessed in a realistic engine environment. The gas generator, or core, is the basic building block of the engine and nominally consists of a compressor, a combustor, a high-pressure turbine, mechanical systems, and core subsystems. Experimental core engine demonstration validates engineering design tools and enhances rapid, low-risk transition of key engine technologies into engineering development, where they can be applied to derivative and\/or new systems. These technologies are applicable to a wide range of military and commercial systems including aircraft, missiles, land combat vehicles, ships, and responsive space launch. Component technologies are demonstrated in a core (sub-engine). This project also assesses the impact of low spool components such as; inlet systems, fans, low pressure turbines, exhaust systems, and system level technologies such as; integrated power generators and thermal management systems on core engine performance, and durability in ground demonstrations of engine cores. The core performances of this project are validated on demonstrator engines in the Aircraft Propulsion Subsystem Integration Project of this program. A portion of this project supports the demonstration of adaptive cycle technologies, which develop component technology for an adaptive cycle engine architecture that provides optimized performance, fuel efficiency, and durability for widely varying mission needs.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, will be transferred from PE 0603216F, Aerospace Propulsion & Power Technology, Project 63681B, to PE 0603033F, Next Gen Platform Demo, Project 63681B, Advanced Turbine Engine Gas Generator, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be managed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start."

                        "val": "This program develops and demonstrates technologies to support Air Force electronic combat warfighting capabilities. The program focuses on developing components, subsystems, and technologies with potential aerospace, special operations, and airlift electronic combat applications. It develops and demonstrates technologies for integrating electronic combat sensors and systems into a fused and seamless whole. It integrates and focuses research efforts in electronic warfare and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding. It develops and demonstrates technologies for navigation and timing in radio frequency (RF) contested and denied environments. It develops and demonstrates advanced technologies for radio frequency electronic combat suites and advanced warning and countermeasure technologies to defeat electro-optical, infrared, and laser threats to aerospace platforms. It also develops and demonstrates technologies that will enable mission systems to be more resilient, agile, autonomous, and be able to operate in multiple domains. This program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, and Project 63691X, EO\/IR Warning & Countermeasures Tech, will be transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities.  \n\nIn FY 2021, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasures Tech, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasures Tech. Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to the PE 0603032F, Future Air Force Integrated Tech Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, will be transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 634335, Cyber Concepts.\n\nAll of these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start.  This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

It develops disruptive electronic warfare and countermeasures concepts specifically selected for high-impact, game-changing effects; evaluates them in high fidelity virtual and hardware evaluation settings; and demonstrates them in an operationally relevant environment.  It establishes and maintains an all-source, physics-based, threat-to-countermeasures electronic warfare systems engineering methodology. It develops a core analytic function, supported by simulation-based wargaming and interactive engineering modeling capabilities to evaluate advanced countermeasures concepts.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, will be transferred to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 633720, EW Quick Reaction Capabilities, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

The research also focuses on the development and demonstration of subsystems and components for generating on-board\/off-board radio frequency countermeasure techniques. This includes the development of electronic countermeasures techniques, as well as advanced electronic countermeasures technologies such as antennas, power amplifiers, and preamplifiers.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasure Tech, will be transferred from PE 0603270F, Electronic Combat Technology to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 63431G, RF Warning & Countermeasure Tech with the exception of the work and funding that is associated with the Navigation Technology Satellite-3 Vanguard demonstration which will be realigned to PE 0603032F, Future Air Force Integrated Tech Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards. These transfers are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start. This Project and associated non-Vanguard efforts and activities will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio."

This project aims to develop cyber resilience and protect systems through adaptation of the system to the threat.  It demonstrates these technologies in open and adaptable architectures for system integration in field demonstrations and proves out the technologies through rapid integration of sensors and architectures for technology transition. It integrates research efforts in electronic and cyber warfare to rapidly demonstrate a capability for rapid fielding.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 634335, Cyber Concepts, will be transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, C2 Tech, Project 634335, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.

Future improved space-qualifiable electronics and software for data and signal processing will be more interchangeable, interoperable, and standardized. In the near-term, this project's work concentrates on converting (for example, radiation-hardening) commercial data and signal processor technologies for use in Air Force space systems. For mid-term applications, this project merges advanced, radiation-hardened space processor, memory, and interconnect technologies with commercially-derived, open system architectures to develop and demonstrate robust, on-board processing capabilities for 21st century Department of Defense satellites. In the long-term, this project area focuses on developing low-cost, easily modifiable software and hardware architectures for fully autonomous constellations of intelligent satellites capable of performing all mission related functions without operator intervention.\n\nIn FY 2021 and future years, the efforts and activities under Project 632181, Spacecraft Payloads, have been postponed\/curtailed due to higher Air Force, Space Force, and Department of Defense priorities."

Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603444F, Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS), and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Technology Directorate located in Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

State-of-the-science advances are made in warfighter training, warfighter system interfaces, directed energy bioeffects, deployment and sustainment of warfighters in extreme environments, and understanding and shaping adversarial behavior. The Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to predict, evaluate, and mitigate the effects of directed energy on personnel and mission performance, and exploits the offensive capabilities of directed energy systems. The Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to sustain airman performance in adverse operational and\/or training environments, monitor and mitigate in-flight unexplained physiological events, and prevent human performance related mishaps through real-time monitoring and mitigation\u2014particularly through highly automated or autonomous systems. The Mission Effective Performance project develops, demonstrates, and transitions advanced training, simulation, mission rehearsal, and other performance-aiding methods and technologies to enhance warfighter readiness. The Warfighter Interfaces project develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies to revolutionize the way airmen synergistically use Air Force systems, including autonomous machines and adaptive teams of airmen and machines. Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense (DoD) Science and Technology (S&T) Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635323, Directed Energy Bioeffects Parameters, and Project 635324, Human Dynamics and Terrain Demonstration, will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demos.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635325, Mission Effective Performance, will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, Project 635327, Warfighter Interfaces, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness and C2 Tech.  Skyborg Vanguard activities under this Project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603456F, Human Effectiveness Advanced Technology Development, to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start.  This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Airman Systems Technology Directorate located in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and Joint Base San Antonio - Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

                        "val": "This project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advance ordnance and guidance technologies for air-launched conventional weapons.  The effort focuses on conventional ordnance component technologies such as war-heads, fuzes, and explosives, as well as munition guidance component technologies such as navigation and control systems and seekers.  Technologies to be developed, demonstrated, and integrated into system concepts will address blast, fragmentation, penetration, low collateral damage, variable depth\/location fuzing, precise guidance, and high-performance and insensitive explosives.  Efforts in this project have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 63670A, Weapon Technology Development will be transferred from PE 0603601F, Conventional Weapons Technology, to PE 0603035F, Next Generation Effects Dev\/ Demo. \n\nIn FY 2021, Project 63670B, Weapon Concept Development, non-Vanguard efforts and activities will be transferred from PE 0603601F, Conventional Weapon Technology, to PE 063035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demo.  Golden Horde Vanguard activities under this project will be consolidated and transferred in FY 2021 from PE 0603601F, Conventional Weapon Technology to PE 0603032F, Future AF Integrated Technology Demos, Project 630320, Air Force Vanguards.  \n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Technology Directorate located in Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science and technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

These include high energy laser (HEL), high power microwaves (HPM),  and other unconventional weapon generation and transmission technologies, which can support a wide range of Air Force applications. The program develops a corresponding susceptibility, vulnerability, and lethality database for directed energy weapons. This program also develops laser-enabled atmospheric-compensated optical imaging for space situational awareness (SSA). Efforts in this program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n \nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603605F, Advanced Weapons Technology, and associated Projects will be transferred to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demo, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment and not a new start. This work will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Technology Directorate located in Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities.  The use of program funds in this program element would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

The program develops and improves manufacturing technologies and processes to enable cost reduction, improve component and system quality, and enhance industrial capability.  Value stream modifications and manufacturing throughput improvements are effected to shorten cycle times of weapon systems during design, development, production and sustainment.  Manufacturing Technologies objectives are conducted through industrial partnerships which enable the demonstration of manufacturing technologies for existing weapon system upgrades and\/or for new warfighter systems.  Efforts in the program have been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design. \n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of PE 0603680F, Manufacturing Technology Program and associated Project will be transferred to PE 0603030F, AF Foundational Development\/Demonstration, as part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept, and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate located in Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start.\n \nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

                        "val": "This program develops and demonstrates Air Force enterprise-centric information technologies for the warfighter. The Anticipatory Operations Intent and Response project develops the technologies for dynamic planning and execution with the accuracy, fidelity, and timeliness needed to dominate the battlespace. The Assured Worldwide Connectivity project provides advanced net-enabled architectures and communications technologies in support of global military operations, including a secure information grid for worldwide information exchange of near-real-time multimedia (i.e., voice, data, video, and imagery) information. In addition, this project develops and demonstrates advanced optical networking and communications for Air Force air and space-based information exchange on and between platforms. These optical networks will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs) and air and space- based platforms either en route or in theater. This project also provides tools and applications leading to the development and integration of cyber deterrence technologies resulting in a strategic capability of cyber dominance within the secure information grid. The Global Battlespace Awareness project develops, integrates, and demonstrates advanced technologies to achieve comprehensive net-centric operations and total battlespace awareness by using and exploiting information from all sources. The Knowledge Management and Computing project develops the technology applications that will provide for a secure, tailored, seamless exchange of information among producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to a particular community of interest (COI). The project also provides the development of interactive and real-time computing technologies that greatly improve the usability of high-performance computing for the exchange, utilization, and management of information in the enterprise. The Cyber Battlespace Development and Demonstration project develops the ability to deliver sovereign options in cyberspace through the development and integration of cyber attack, cyber defense, and cyber support technologies for a strategic capability of cyber dominance.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. Operational agility will require flexibility (manifested as multi-domain operations), speed (manifested as superior decision speed), coordination (manifested as dynamic command and control), balance (manifested as presenting a balanced capability mix), and strength (manifested as performance-optimized teams). In order to enable operational agility, this program will begin to shape future research and development (R&D) to focus on technologies in support of operational agility through multi-domain command and control (MDC2) capabilities.\n\nThis program has been coordinated through the Department of Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee process to harmonize efforts and eliminate duplication.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response; Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity; and Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts were transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign planning and decision support, intelligent networking transport and management, and information management advanced technology development.\n\nIn the FY 2021, the Air Force is consolidating its existing thirteen Advanced Technology Development (ATD), Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PEs into five new capability focused RDT&E BA 03 PEs to better align with the Air Force Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy signed by the SECAF in April 2019. This consolidation will improve and accelerate delivery of integrated transformational, multidisciplinary, collaborative technology solutions necessary to enable new Air Force warfighting capabilities that support of the National Defense Strategy. This new structure will provide the Air Force and Congress with a clearer understanding and increased transparency of integrated technology solutions and demonstrations key to enabling the Air Force future force design.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, will be transferred from PE 0603788F, Battlespace Knowledge Development and Demonstration, to PE 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos.\n\nAll these transfers detailed above are part of the Air Force RDT&E BA 03 PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force S&T Strategy, April 2019. This is an administrative realignment for consolidation, and not a new start. The Projects and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver science & technology capabilities. The use of program funds in this PE would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0601102F, 0602102F, 0602201F, 0602202F, 0602203F, 0602204F, 0602602F, 0602605F, 0602788F, 1206601SF, and 0602298F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

This project develops and integrates decision support technologies that will enhance the commander's ability to anticipate and dominate the future battlespace by more effectively forecasting the evolution of the battlespace and by more rapidly generating options to \"virtually checkmate\" the adversary. It develops the decision aid technologies and processes to plan the use of various assets and assess their effects in the battlespace. It provides a tailorable information environment to effectively portray complex data sets accurately in real-time.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response, efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy."

This secure environment will be rapidly deployable, mobile, interoperable, and seamless between the Air Operations Center and aircraft, either en route or in theater.  This project provides secure information transmission capabilities for a persistent, global, survivable communications backbone network accessible for warfighters operating in all domains. It provides self-healing, self-configuration, anti-jam communication networking capabilities, and provides enterprise networking capabilities for agile, policy-based network management.  In addition, this project develops and demonstrates flight ready systems consisting of high capacity radio frequency (RF) and optical components and architectures for next generation communications.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, the Air Force requires world-wide connectivity that is resilient and self-healing in the face of enemy attacks on communication and information assurance, able to withstand breaks in connectivity while still allowing users to collaborate with other connected operators to maintain localized situational awareness. The network balances the respective strengths of both forward-deployed forces and rear-based nodes.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity, efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support both the Air Force Future Operating Concept and National Defense Strategy."

In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn order to achieve operational agility, the Air Force must be able (a) to monitor, assess, plan, and execute missions rapidly across the full spectrum of operations at all levels of war and during all phases of conflict; (b) to field advanced, secure, net-enabled architectures and communications\/network technologies in support of persistent, global, and survivable kinetic and non-kinetic military operations; (c) to process and exploit data and information from a variety of sources and domains to create a common operating picture of the battlespace; and (d) to provide the decision maker and staff with seamless access to tailored information within a mobile, dynamic, and scalable, globally distributed Air Operations Center, as well as among other producers, consumers, and managers of information relevant to other particular Communities of Interest (COI).\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635319, Anticipatory OPS Intent and Response; Project 635320, Assured Worldwide Connectivity; and Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, will be transferred to PE 0603034F, Persistent Knowledge, Awareness, & C2 Tech, Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019. The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York.

This project develops an agile information environment that focuses on quality of service, transformation and brokering, a federated information environment focusing the relationship among the members of the environment, a secure cross-domain information sharing capability that focuses on the security layer and inter-COI information exchange in different security domains, and a collaboration environment focusing on the information workflow layer of the enterprise.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2020, Project 635322, Knowledge Management and Computing, efforts transferred to Project 635321, C4I Battlespace Dev and Demo, in order to realign technology areas that better support the National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept."

This project will also develop 1) a science and engineering capability demonstrating new models of computation, 2) novel approaches for high performance, interactive, net-centric, distributed and embedded computing systems, and 3) the technological tools enabling affordable, large-scale, and complex software-intensive systems.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy and Air Force Future Operating Concept established science and technology challenges to enable operational agility (the ability to rapidly generate and shift among multiple solutions for a given challenge) as a way to adapt swiftly to any situation or enemy action. In order to enable multi-domain operations, this project will begin to shape future research and development to focus on cyber technologies in support of multi-domain command and control.\n\nIn FY 2021, the entirety of Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, will be transferred to Program Element 0603035F, Next Gen Effects Dev\/Demos, Project 635329, Cyber Battlespace Dev & Demo, as part of the Air Force Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), Budget Activity 03 (BA 03) PE consolidation in order to realign technology areas to better support the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Future Operating Concept and Air Force Science and Technology Strategy, April 2019.  The Project and associated efforts will continue to be executed by the Air Force Research Laboratory Information Technology Directorate located in Rome, New York.

Based on existing technological capabilities, WAS detects\/tracks low, slow and other asymmetrical threats in the airspace and meet the user needs of sensing stressing airborne targets in complex environments with affordable sensors. The sensor outputs are incorporated into the Battle Control Systems-Fixed (BCS-F) air picture and utilized as the NORAD\/USNORTHCOM Command and Control (C2) air surveillance system of record.\n\nAspects of the WAS program are classified and information will be provided on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThis program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver WAS weapon system capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program element 0605831F.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 7, Operational System Development because this budget activity includes development efforts to upgrade systems that have been fielded or have received approval for full rate production and anticipate production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year.\n\nThis exhibit, and the statement below, erroneously show development effort in Budget Activity 3 (project 834240).

Science & technology contracts were let prior to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase for both sub-systems. The Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract for Stateside Affordable Radar System (STARS) was awarded to a single developer to design, build, integrate, and test the STARS system. A subsequent task order was awarded (Jul 17) to include pre-operational site support. The CPFF contract for Scorpion was awarded (Aug 17) to a single developer to complete the design, build, integration, and testing of the Scorpion system, and conduct pre-operational site support. This strategy includes a single delivery approach with 11 STARS and 18 Scorpion systems for a total of 29  sub-systems delivered to achieve FOC. The pre-operational contract for the Scorpion system transitioned to Interim Contract Support (ICS) in Dec 2018, STARS system transitioned to ICS in June 2019.\n\nAir Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) DIGITAL (AFPEO DIGITAL) is the PEO for WAS.

Being able to operate in accordance with spectrum allocations resulting after the spectrum auction is necessary, but not sufficient, for pursued technology solutions. The Department of Defense transition out of or sharing of the auctioned bands can only be successful if the research and development solutions are effective (for example, survivable, electronically protected, et cetera) while operating in both the United States and congested\/contested spectrum environments wherever forces will be deployed.\n\nThis program represents the Air Force investment within the SAR&DP. Budget for the Air Force portion of the DoD SAR&DP is created from the auction of Advanced Wireless Service licenses in execution year.\n\nFunding supports Spectrum relocation and sharing activities.\n\nThis program is in Budget Activity 3, Advanced Technology Development because this budget activity includes development of subsystems and components and efforts to integrate subsystems and components into system prototypes for field experiments and\/or tests in a simulated environment."

                        "val": "The Joint Staff requests $8.329M in FY 2021 procurement for mission critical information technology systems and applications investment requirements. The procurement request resources various efforts across the Joint Staff, including National Defense University.  \n\nNote: In FY 2020, Joint Information Operations Range (JIOR) was moved to a new line item (line 15) to improve visibility into Cyber program resources.\n\n1. Planning and Decision Aid System (PDAS):\n\nPDAS is a classified, protected program operated by the Joint Staff.  PDAS is a command and control system that supports the planning and execution of Joint Staff and Unified Combatant Commanders (CCMD) operations.  PDAS is a worldwide network protecting sensitive information that meets the Intelligence Community Directive 503 security requirements.  PDAS provides office automation packages, document and information management tools; collaboration, voice, and video tools in a secure, flexible architecture that promotes a distributed enterprise.  Within the enterprise, PDAS users have access to their data regardless of log-on location, secure data exchange, conferencing and planning sessions among physically distributed continental United States and outside continental United States locations. PDAS provides users with access to a Help Desk and remote troubleshooting within the PDAS enterprise.\n\nPDAS realigned Procurement funding, $3.0M per year, to O&M to fund higher priority requirements for the following years:  FY 2019, FY 2021 \u2013 FY 2024.  FY 2020 Procurement funding supports equipment modernizations and technology refresh for major systems and data centers. Due to an expanding base of users, Procurement funding was increased by $1.0M in FY 2020 to support additional equipment modernization and technology refresh requirements.\n\nEquipment modernization will allow the Joint Staff to develop plans to implement materiel solutions to address hardware and software configuration items that are outdated, nearing end-of-life or end-of-support or which can no longer be commercially acquired or supported.  Historically, this equipment has been purchased as required due to failures, end-of-life, or end-of-service which has led to many baselines and configurations of deployed hardware, software and communications equipment. Items reach end-of-life in different years providing a cascade of equipment replacement requirements.  This spacing lessens the financial impact in any one year but requires constant purchase, integration, testing and installation resulting in higher overall cost and effort.  Integration and testing ensures that hardware or software is compatible with other installed hardware and software configuration items and does not introduce vulnerabilities into PDAS, or allow unauthorized personnel to gain access to information for which they are not authorized.  There are four specific procurement requirements as follows.\n\nPDAS funding will be used to procure equipment modernizations, datacenter refresh, and client refresh. Due to the cyclic nature of the PDAS technical refresh requirement of datacenters, client computers and other IT equipment, this program presents a non-linear funding profile with noticeable spikes in funding requirements during technical refresh years.  When possible, equipment is purchased in increments across fiscal years to lessen spikes in funding requirements where possible. Funding spikes support major system upgrades for data centers in FY 2018 and user clients in FY 2020.\n\nPDAS is composed of hundreds of user sites with thousands of users worldwide. In recent years, the number of PDAS sites grew by 25 percent and continues with demand for expansion of both new sites and users.  Funding provides capabilities, services and the infrastructure necessary to meet these operational mission needs. \n\nClient refresh allows the Joint Staff to provide updated computer hardware to the PDAS users in order to be compliant with Security Control 28 (protection of information at rest to prevent insider threats). This periodic refresh will provide users with an updated hardware and software infrastructure, enabling improved performance, security, efficiency, and reducing logistical requirements. Client refresh is planned to begin in FY 2020 and completed in FY 2022.\n\nDatacenter refresh allows the Joint Staff to provide refreshed datacenter hardware and software. The hardware and software will be reaching the end of its service life and approaching obsolescence.  New equipment for the datacenters will enable the PDAS program to consolidate equipment baselines and provide commonality at the datacenters. This periodic refresh provides PDAS with an updated hardware and software infrastructure, enabling improved performance, security, efficiency, and reduced logistical requirements.  From an operational perspective, it moves the program from event-driven, reactive situations of coping with the latest problem to a more proactive, forward-facing operational posture. The focus becomes one of preemptive quality assurance, standardization, and optimization.  Datacenter refresh is planned to begin in FY 2025.\n\n2. Management Headquarters:\n\nManagement Headquarters provides the day-to-day financial resources necessary to conduct Joint Staff operations. Funding supports the mission-unique non-Joint Service Provider (JSP), Joint Staff IT requirements, and technology upgrades for the joint training facility, and Joint Integrated Air & Missile Defense Organization (JIAMDO), Joint Range Extender (JRE). \n\nManagement Headquarters funds are also used to procure major hardware and software technology upgrade investments for the Suffolk, VA, joint training facility. These funds provide significant network distribution\/security, data processing, and capacity upgrades to the Suffolk Data Center to increase performance, security, reliability, and accessibility to the Combatant Commands and Services. Capability upgrades are required to host current joint training applications (Joint Knowledge Online, Joint Training Information Management System, Joint Lessons Learned Information Systems, and Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive simulations). Additionally, the upgrades provide support to multi-site, multi-command, distributed live, virtual, and constructive joint force training events addressing transregional, multi-domain, and multi-functional threat environments.\n\nThe Deputy Secretary of Defense approved the alignment of common IT services in the Pentagon and the National Capital Region to JSP operating as a field service activity in Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). In FY 2018, the Joint Staff Information Network resources permanently transferred to the JSP (DISA PE 0305830K).  The overall effect to the Department was a net-zero profile change for FY 2018 and beyond.  Limited IT procurement funding was retained for mission-unique, non-JSP Joint Staff IT requirements. \n\n3.  National Defense University (NDU):\nThe mission of the National Defense University (NDU) is to educate joint warfighters in critical thinking and the creative application of military power to inform national strategy and globally integrated operations, under conditions of disruptive change, in order to conduct war.  NDU seeks to create strategic advantage by developing warfighters and other national security leaders and forging relationships though whole-of-nations and whole-of-government educational programs, research, and engagement.  \n\nNDU requests $6.000M in FY 2021 procurement for mission critical information technology systems and applications.  This is a new procurement line item required to acquire IT systems and components that exceed the threshold for using Operation and Maintenance funds (Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation - DoD 7000.14-R) and is a net-zero realignment of funds from Operations and Maintenance to Procurement within the NDU program.  \n\nThe objective is to modernize NDU's outdated IT infrastructure and associated classroom technology which will offset years of deferred lifecycle maintenance. This modernization includes replacing archaic and insecure network infrastructure, updating teaching spaces and tools, and providing the necessary resources to meet the operating standards defined by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the University accrediting standards. Specifically, NDU plans the following IT modernization efforts: \n\nUpgrade Campus Servers: Currently, 49% (67\/136 servers) of NDU campus servers are at End of Service (EOS) status.\n\nUpgrade Telecommunications Closets: Communication closets throughout NDU did not originally follow a configuration management process at installation.  As such, cable and physical security (e.g., badge readers) are not in accordance with industry standards, space layout is inefficient, and space environmental support is insufficient. Power temperature (due to HVAC limitations), electrical, and fire safety requirements are at maximum capacity. These inadequacies impose a significant risk to physical and information security as well as to personnel safety.\n\nUpgrade Teaching Facilities: Technology in 97 classrooms, conferences rooms, and auditoriums are also at end of service life.\n\nIn order to accomplish the aforementioned modernization goals, NDU will execute a long term strategy that involves both acquisition and execution elements over a multi-fiscal year timeframe.

JIOR uses encrypted tunneling over existing transport networks to conduct mission rehearsal, training, testing, concept development and experimentation in support of Information Operations (IO), Electronic Warfare (EW), Offensive Cyber Operations (OCO), Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO), Spectrum Warfare, Space Operations, and Special Operations Forces mission areas in a realistic threat representative environment. JIOR provides the capability to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces on the full spectrum of cyber weapons\/capabilities without risk of observation or fratricide. JIOR is unique within the Department of Defense and is accredited by DIA for operations at Unclassified through Top Secret-Special Compartment Information (TS-SCI) in a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) environment. JIOR is approved for use by Special Access Programs (SAP), Special Access Required Programs (SAR), and for Special Technical Operations (STO). JIOR provides Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C\/S\/A's) and key allied partners the ability to test deployment and collaboratively gain insights into advanced cyberspace and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environments. JIOR integrates available cyberspace ranges with the training\/test audience providing access to low density\/high demand test and training resources including critical infrastructure, cyber targets, internet traffic, and opposing forces. JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments. C\/S\/A's conduct hundreds of mission rehearsal, training, testing, and experimentation events on the JIOR annually.\n\nJIOR procurement funding is used to purchase technology upgrades\/modernization to the JIOR enterprise network. Planned equipment and software modernization enable the JIOR to extend service to 36 new sites while continuing support to the existing 138 JIOR access points. Equipment for 7 of these sites will be procured in FY 2021.\n\nHistorically, JIOR had limited IT refresh funding and has purchased replacement hardware due to failures, end-of-life, or end-of-service constraints which has not allowed for a focused modernization effort. Given the increased cyber mission focus, periodic technology upgrades are required to make the JIOR more efficient, agile, and sufficiently robust to accommodate this significant network expansion to meet the additional Cyber Mission Force demand."

The exercise environment included a \"blue forces\" Department of Defense information network, a \"gray\" network of internet spaces to include .gov and .edu domains that emulated Internet sites and user activities, a realistic representation of an adversary \"red\" network, and a management systems network. This emulated training environment utilized the existing Joint Information Operation Range (JIOR) transport layer to directly supported USCYBERCOM's mission. Procurement funding increased storage capacity and improved the survivability\/durability of the target environment.\n \n2. Joint Interoperability Division (JID).  JID provided Tactical Data Link and Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) training. Procurement funds supported acquisition of one Satellite Simulator (SATSIM) and two Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) radio systems required for JICO mission equipment."

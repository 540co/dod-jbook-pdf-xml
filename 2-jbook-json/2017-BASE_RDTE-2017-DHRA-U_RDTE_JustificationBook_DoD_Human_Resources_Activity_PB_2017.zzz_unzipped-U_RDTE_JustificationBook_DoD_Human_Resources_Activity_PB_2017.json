ADL is working in collaboration with our partners to develop the next generation training learning architecture (TLA).  The TLA will modernize the way we learn by facilitating learning experiences that take advantage of current and emerging technologies based on new standards built on web services.  ADL is conducting research on intelligent tutoring technologies that support the creation of a personal assistant for learning (PAL).  The PAL will further empower learners with effective learning content that is more personalized and context sensitive. ADL was established by Executive Order 13111, with policy oversight by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Readiness) (Training Readiness and Strategy)."

RDTE funding in FY17 will be applied to the start-up costs for expanding the recruiting database provided to all Military Services for use with officer and enlisted recruiting and to explore the merits of expanding use to civilian recruiting as proposed in a Force of the Future initiative. Specifically, the funds will provide contractor support for the development of a pilot expanded database, procurement of additional directory lists, and the purchase of IT hardware and software for the development of a user- friendly interface for accessing the data.  FY17 RDTE funds in HSPD-12 will be applied to the DoD NextGen USID and will allow the Department  to replace the existing Teslin ID cards which are highly susceptible to counterfeiting due to an outdated design and lack of newer anti-counterfeiting technology, by completing the design of the new card form factor utilizing the latest technical and printing techniques on a plastic substrate which will undergo extensive quality."

                        "val": "The Department of Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered to support the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)).  This PE includes application of R&D to expedite prototype development and mission support efforts to sustain and\/or modernize operations required for general RDT&E.\n\nFor FY 2017, as a result of a Business Process and Systems Review, DHRA will implement a major reorganization that will impact the DHRA RDT&E budget.  The most significant aspect of this reorganization, from a RDT&E perspective, will be the integration of the Enterprise Human Resources Information System (EHRIS) into the Defense Manpower Data Center\u2019s (DMDC) portfolio of information technology (IT) initiatives.  Additionally, DHRA has implemented a major reorganization of the DMDC programs to more accurately align budget program lines with the DHRA Information Technology (IT) data reported in the DHRA IT Budget.  The Defense Eligibility and Enrollment System (DEERS); Data Governance; Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS); Common Access Card (CAC); Cyber Security program has been decomposed into a DEERS program and a RAPIDS program, with CAC being retained as part of the RAPIDS program.  Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) has been integrated into a Personnel Accountability (PA) program, that also includes Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and the Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS).  \n\nProject 1:  DoD Enlistment Processing and Testing. The project administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military  recruits. The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1)\treduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn. \nThis program realigns to STAR which is project #9..\n\nProject 2: Human Resources Automation Enhancements.  The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS), a DHRA component, manages and operates a number of major DoD programs, including the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). DCPDS is the Department's enterprise civilian human resources information system. It ensures a coherent, standardized, and cost-effective system for the entire Department. DCPDS is built using a commercial off-the-shelf product customized for Federal and Defense requirements. The system is web-enabled and provides flexibility to respond to changes in the Department's civilian human resources (HR) operational requirements.\nDCPDS supports HR operations and improved business processes with continuous implementation of improved technology, meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals. Network and system operations span worldwide, with 24\/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. In FY 15, funds for new development are insufficient to implement all planned civilian HR IT Roadmap initiatives. Many projects will be pushed to FY 16 and therefore require additional funding. These include the implementation of manager and employee initiated actions, expansion of the data warehouse, and movement of all HRIT systems to the Denver Data Center.\n\nOther DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation. DHRA\/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes.\nThis project realigns to EHRIS, which is project #10 starting in FY 2017.\n\nProject 3: NEO Tracking System.  The Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO)Tracking System (NTS) \/ Emergency Tracking Accountability System (ETAS) is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO under the authority of DODD 1000.25, DoD Personnel Identity Protection (PIP) Program. NTS is currently being used in the USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USSOUTHCOM, and USPACOM Area of Responsibility. The ETAS component is the CONUS domestic version of NTS and is for use by USNORTHCOM during disasters in the CONUS whether natural, accidental, or acts of terrorism. The primary purpose of the NTS\/ETAS is to provide individual accountability of the evacuee by creating and maintaining a database of evacuees assembled during an evacuation operation and subsequently tracking the evacuees' movement throughout the evacuation process.  Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to research and development supporting the integration of the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service and the Organization Unique Identifiers in this family of systems that provides secure attribute based access control.\nThis project realigns to PA which is project #11 starting in FY 2017.\n\nProject 4:  Synchronized Pre-deployment & Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite.  The Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker Enterprise Suite (SPOT-ES) is the Department of Defense (DoD) system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. SPOT-ES provides web based tracking and visibility into contract services, personnel and equipment locations; provides a common operational picture for Combatant Commanders; enhances the analytical tools to accurately plan for the quantity of contracted support required for future contingency operations; and collects accurate data for the Office of Management and Budget- directed quarterly census of all contractors supporting contingency operations. Minor growth from FY 2015 to FY 2016 is attributed to development and integration of more rugged and transportable Automatic Identification Technologies that facilitates person accountability and property tracking and accountability of the NTS.\nThis project realigns under PA, which is  project #11 starting in FY 2017.\n \nProject 5:  ESGR Awards & Activity Tracking (AATR) Tool.  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) requires a comprehensive web-based application (Awards and Activity Tracking and Reporting) to track ESGR Activities to include briefings and recognition of civilian employers and briefings of National Guard and Reserve that will track against organizational goals vs. costs and the hours donated by Volunteers.  The application will replace several manual processes that use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets across 54 State Committees and through contractor support.  This will also place all critical data in a DoD Data Center.  Development of a web-based application would immensely improve data collection and analysis while allowing field staff and volunteers to better focus on operations and mission accomplishment.  The application would be an addition to ESGR\u2019s current Portal that contains ESGR\u2019s member management, inquiry and case management, and freedom award nomination systems.  In FY 2016, funding will support the design and efforts will carry over into FY 2017.  In FY 2018, funds required to build and implement design changes.\n\nProject 6:  Enterprise Data Services.  Cybersecurity deals with the unauthorized exposure of classified data to WikiLeaks raised awareness on the need for improved data security management and access control measures across DoD IT enterprise.  In PBR-12 one issue was critically linked to this risk and fully funded - Cross Domain Information Sharing (CDS).  CDS provides for protected, automated transfer of data across networks of different security classifications reducing the need for removable media while better safe guarding the transport of information from one network to another.  DMDC is developing the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)\/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment as an immediate deterrent to allow\/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).  Further, DOD will have the ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions. This is a new start.  \n\nProject 7:  Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database.  The Defense Sexual Assault Incidents Database (DSAID) is the integrated DoD SAPR Data Collection and Reporting System that accommodates a variety of uses, including the tracking of sexual assault victim support services, support SAPR program administration, program reporting requirements, and data analysis. In order to facilitate analysis at the OSD level, the System will be able to easily export data for analysis in computerized statistical applications, such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Service field-level users use the system to track support to victims of sexual assault throughout the lifecycle of that support requirement and to facilitate sexual assault case transfer between SARCs and Services. Service headquarters-level users use the system to support program planning, analysis, and management. DoD SAPR Office (SAPRO) users and Service headquarters-level users access the system to produce mandated and requested reports, monitor program effectiveness and support cohort and trend analysis.\n\nProject 8.  Computer\/Electronic Accommodations Program.   The Computer\/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to support individuals with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members throughout the Federal Government in accessing information and communication technology.  CAP currently has partnerships with 69 federal agencies.  CAP\u2019s wounded, ill, and injured Service member\u2019s initiative is designed to cover active duty Service members, to include Guard or Reserve who are on active duty orders, including Title 10 orders.  Since its inception, the program has provided over 150,000 accommodations for Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD employees with disabilities and wounded, ill, and injured Service members.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 alone, CAP filled 12,789 accommodations \u2013 the most ever in a single year.  \n\nCurrently CAP utilizes a Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) product designed to support the program\u2019s robust mission.  This product, CAP Portal, is used primarily to process DoD and other government agencies requests for hardware, software, training, and other miscellaneous accommodation services.  CAP Portal also processes information pertaining to developing and tracking requirements packages, market research, events and outreach to include proposals, presentations, materials, and assistive technology.  The CAP Portal allows staff and contract support personnel to utilize all aspects of its functionality to facilitate the provision of reasonable accommodations, and run various reports to make financial forecasts with the data that is contained within the system.\n\nProject 9:  STAR project administers testing programs, which enable the Armed Services to select highly qualified military recruits. The DoD uses a single test, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), to determine eligibility of military applicants and to report recruit quality data to Congress. High quality recruits are obtained from administering the ASVAB annually to approximately 600,000 applicants for Military Service as part of the DoD Enlistment Testing program, and to 1 million students in the DoD Student Testing program. Each Service also uses ASVAB test forms developed in this program as part of their in-service testing programs. New ASVAB test forms and related support materials are implemented approximately every four years. This allows DoD to make measurement improvements as well as decrease the likelihood of test compromise. Ongoing RDT&E efforts include development and evaluation of procedures which (1) reduce or eliminate threats to the validity of the ASVAB test scores generated; (2) improve the efficiency of the test development, calibration, and validation process; and (3) improve selection and classification decisions made by each Service through more effective use of test score information. In addition, periodic assessments are required to provide DoD manpower planners and Congress with information on aptitude trends in the population from which recruits are drawn.  This is a new project but not a new start.  This project realigns from Project 1 starting in FY 2017.\n\nProject 10:   (EHRIS) is the Department\u2019s enterprise civilian human resources (HR) transactional system supporting 800,000 employees, representing approximately one-third of the federal government\u2019s civilian work force. DCPDS has proven its business case, avoiding costs for the Department of over $200M\/year when compared to the multiple DoD Component operational costs prior to establishment of the enterprise system.  The consolidation of all instances of DCPDS at the DDC completed in 2014 has resulted in substantial component savings.  In FY 15\/16, additional data center consolidation will include additional HRIT Enterprise systems moving to the DDC.\nNetwork and system operations span worldwide, with 24\/7 operations that support 19 Regional Service Centers and over 300 Customer Support Units. The current focus of DCPDS is the expansion of these efficiencies through the consolidation of DCPDS operations to a single database and expansion of capabilities to support integrated Benefits processing and data management supporting Department\u2019s Force of the Future initiative. \nOther DCPAS programs supporting the civilian workforce include minimizing involuntary separations, assisting laid-off workers, maintaining workforce balance, and reducing the costs of DoD's workers and unemployment compensation via the Defense Injury and Unemployment Compensation System (DIUCS). DHRA\/DCPAS supports the development, issuance and maintenance of uniform DoD-wide civilian personnel policy; provides program guidance and technical interpretation for both appropriated and non-appropriated funded civilian HR programs ; manages DoD's Civilian Assistance and Re-Employment (CARE) program, including the Priority Placement Program (PPP); investigates and mediates discrimination complaints; conducts grievance investigations; and manages the operation of the enterprise civilian HR information system, DCPDS. These programs are supported by an aggressive data automation program, to include a communications capability, computing equipment, and an automation software link to standardize these divergent functions. These funds continue to support these processes. This is a new project but not a new start.  This project realigns from Project 2.\n\nProject 11:  Personnel Accountability program is comprised of three systems: Synchronized Pre-deployment Operational Tracker (SPOT), Joint Personnel Accountability Reconciliation and Reporting (JPARR), and Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) Tracking System (NTS). This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilian, contractor and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting  of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees. This is a new project but not a new start.  This project realigns from project #3 and project #4.\n\nProject 12:  Personnel Security Assurance (PSA) provides comprehensive capabilities to perform processing and verification of security clearances for all DoD military personnel, civilians and contractors including the technology and processes that need to be addressed in order to implement Continuous Evaluation.  Planning funds within this program will support the Defense Information System for Security (DISS) which transfers to DHRA\/DMDC from DLA starting in FY 2017.  The DISS mission is to consolidate the DoD personnel security mission into an enterprise adjudicative case management system that will automate the implementation of improved national investigative and adjudicative standards to eliminate costly and inefficient work processes and increase information collaboration across the community.  This is a new start."

In addition, changes to DCPDS are required for mandates for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), HR Line of Business (LoB), electronic Official Personnel Folder, and Retirement Systems Modernization implementation. DoD is one of five designated Shared Service Centers in the federal  government focused on providing standard services across agency lines, gaining potential significant business and cost-saving benefits. DoD is considered a leader in this initiative. \n\nDCPDS is the Department\u2019s enterprise civilian HR system that has provided the savings originally projected in the achievement of full operational capability in 2002 and which has continued to operate as the DoD system serving over 800,000 employee records. Additional initiatives to sustain the Department\u2019s lead in automated systems include expansion of employee self-service functionality, and support for data warehouse improvements, engineering plans for consolidation and migration to a federal data center, an employee-manager portal, and information assurance initiatives to comply with DoD-mandated DMZ requirements. DCPDS enhancements will support the Department\u2019s focus on the further consolidation of civilian HR operations to a single operational site, with linkage to Component operations worldwide. \n\nThis project realigns to Project #10, EHRIS, starting in FY 2017."

This family of systems represents end-to-end tracking, reconciliation and reporting of DoD personnel location and movements, to include military, DoD affiliated civilians, contractors, and U.S. citizens. This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting  of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a \"public\" SIPR only application that provides daily person-level location reporting.  JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail.  NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO.\n\nThis project realigns to Project #11, PA, starting in FY 2017."

Cross Domain Information Sharing (CDS) provides for protected, automated transfer of data across networks of different security classifications reducing the need for removable media while better safe guarding the transport of information from one network to another.  DMDC is developing the Enterprise Identity Attribute Service (EIAS)\/Access Based Access Control technology in the classified environment as an immediate deterrent to allow\/deny access to classified information giving the DoD the ability to control and monitor pre-provisioned user access in a manner that cannot be repudiated (e.g., using CAC-enabled PKE Authentication).  Further, DOD will have the ability to enable, monitor and control the authorized transfer of information between SIPRNET and other DOD Networks as required via globally available and operationally effective cross domain enterprise service solutions."

This project will help CAP obtain and maintain an optimized and certified DBS that executes data collection, records management, and reporting accountability for all stakeholders.  In order to enhance areas of program data-tracking capabilities and stabilize the environment for future operations, CAP requires modernization of CAP Portal.  The CAP Portal has pages\/controls that have accumulated up to 7,000 lines of code, making it difficult to ensure the reliability of any updates made to the system which has undergone over 500 change requests since its launch.  There are components and functionality that are no longer being utilized and others needed, but it is risky to remove or disable due to the interconnected nature of the codebase.  The current codebase utilizes an outdated framework that is difficult to maintain. The CAP Modernization Project will implement a .NET Model View Controller (MVC) framework to separate the business, display and input layers of the code.  As CAP\u2019s operating procedures evolve, CAP Portal\u2019s current structure will not match the changing business needs of its users. Towards that end, the issue of restructuring CAP Portal is necessary to ensure flexibility and reliability moving forward.  As a result of an outdated framework, the current CAP Portal is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain and less reliable when making updates.  The CAP Modernization Project will provide a restructured database for CAP Portal with an updated codebase to provide a solid foundation that supports CAP\u2019s current structure and business processes while also increasing flexibility for future enhancements and efficiencies.  All aspects of CAP Portal will be enhanced by this project, which will provide a streamlined foundation on which to incorporate new internal processing workflow entitled ONE CAP.  It will provide the ability to implement new processes that reflect the current organization, roles, responsibilities, tasks and specific workflow and assignments.  The modernization of technology will ensure full integration of the new internal operating model."

This includes DoD travel, contracts, and contractor personnel tracking in support of contingencies, military readiness, reporting  of locations at the unit and person level, accountability of DoD personnel during (and after) natural or man-made disasters, and accountability and visibility of noncombatant evacuees.  SPOT is the DoD system of record for accountability and visibility of contracts and contractor personnel authorized to operate in a contingency operation. JPARR is a \"public\" SIPR only application that provides daily person-level location reporting.  JPARR receives feeds for Service and Agency deployment systems, reconciles the data, and provides various reports at unit level detail.  NTS is a certified and accredited DoD automated system that accounts for, and sustains visibility of noncombatant evacuees during a NEO."

Accordingly, the Joint Staff requires an experimentation capability to analyze and validate priority joint concept required capabilities. \n\nConcept analysis and validation will have a multi-faceted nature to meet the Chairmen\u2019s Title 10 responsibility of, \u201cidentifying new joint military capabilities based on advances in technology and concepts of operation, and recommending investments and experiments in such capabilities.\u201d Wargames will assess baseline mission and campaign level outcomes of the concepts as well as identify a tradespace of potential new capabilities. This tradespace of capabilities is further explored with quantitative models and software that identify the most efficient cost and capability tradeoffs to help meet the Title 10 responsibility of \u201cadvising the Secretary on new and alternative joint military capabilities, and alternative program recommendations and budget proposals, within projected resource levels.\u201d \n\nThe National Defense Strategy directs \u201cearly design tradeoffs in the requirements process to increase the speed of delivery.\u201d The Joint Staff approach to tradespace exploration follows that guidance by providing a cost conscious and operationally relevant prioritization tradeoff technique early in the portfolio design process. Using this rigorous prioritization approach, the capability development cycle can efficiently focus resources on more detailed experimentation of specific capabilities to inform the requirements process. The analysis from the experimentation program will be used to provide foundational evidence to directly inform the Joint Military Net Assessment (JMNA), the Chairman\u2019s Program Recommendation (CPR), and ultimately the Defense Planning Guidance for Joint Force development and design."

These concepts include concepts of operations and employment that advance Joint Force operational effectiveness and enable the introduction and incorporation of new capabilities. The Joint Concepts program supports the Chairman's responsibility to express a vision for the future joint force; addressing operational problems on a 20-year horizon; identifying joint force development and design implications; and identifying capabilities required to mitigate and solve future joint warfighting gaps. The goal is to enable investment decisions balancing near and long term risk. Threat-informed joint concepts drive capability development and promote horizontal integration for force development and design across the Services, Combatant Commands, Defense agencies, OSD and Joint Staff. Key deliverables include:  \n\nFamily of Joint Concepts (FOJC): Based on the National Military Strategy (NMS) and providing operational and joint functional approaches to future adversary based challenges or opportunities. These concepts prioritize Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Countering Violent Extremist Organizations (hereafter referred to as the 2+3).  The FOJC drives capability development and alternative approaches to operating in support of a globally integrated force benchmarked against current and long-term pacing threats.  The FOJC includes the Capstone Concept for Joint Operations, Joint Warfighting Concept, Joint Operating Concepts for the 2+3 challenges, Joint Supporting Concepts that address joint warfighting functions, Concepts of Operation and Concepts of Employment.\n\nCapstone Concept for Joint Operations (CCJO): Provides the Chairman's vision for future joint operations and establishes aim points for the development of the future Joint Force. The key theme is globally integrated operations and directs joint concept driven, threat-informed capability to regain competitive advantage.\n\nJoint Warfighting Concept (JWC): Identifies innovative and alternative approaches and design options for the employment of the Joint Force out to 2030.  \n\nJoint Operating Concepts: Describe new ways of operating and associated capability requirements to address the 2+3 threat out fifteen years into the future.  \n\nConcepts of Operations (CONOPS): Describe how the actions of the joint force components and supporting organizations are integrated, synchronized, and phased to accomplish a specific mission or function within the construct of a future scenario.  CONOPS support evaluation of new ways of operating, future force posture mix, advanced capabilities, and authorities in exercises, wargames, and experiments.\n\t\nConcepts of Employment (CONEMPS): Describe, in broad terms, the application of specific technology, process, weapon system, or unit to perform a particular task or procedure.  They are the most specific of all military concepts and contain a level of guidance sufficient to inform the establishment of programmatic requirements. CONEMPS\u2019 focus on the cross-domain employment of capabilities and techniques in areas like space, cyberspace, and the electro-magnetic spectrum (EMS) to enable joint information advantage.\n\nJoint Operating Environment (JOE) and the Gamechangers report: Developed in partnership with DIA, this report describes the future security environment and projects the implications of change for the Joint Force. The documents describe the circumstances that may alter the security environment and explores how the intersection and interaction of these changes might impact the character of war in the future. They provide a framework to think about the full range of Joint Force missions and how they may evolve over time in order to support development of threat-based future Joint concepts and concepts of operations."

This complex task requires technologies that provide integrated information obtained by linking force structure quantitative data (derived from the GFM organizational servers) to qualitative data of Capability, Readiness, Availability and Employment\/Location data (C.R.A.E.) resident in GFM mission applications and associated data bases. The Joint Staff is responsible for GFM allocation and will employ a strategy for efficiently providing Enterprise Force Structure (EFS) data utility.\n\nDoD must meet national military objectives that range from large force scenarios to small-scale activities. Our adversaries demonstrate the ability to readily transition from non-kinetic to kinetic effects. Consequently, Information Technology (IT) superiority, capabilities, and recognition of associated vulnerabilities are an operational imperative. Yet, warfighters, strategic planners and GFM decision makers are unable to exchange information in a manner that rapidly and accurately enables force sourcing activities to support SecDef decisions. The Joint Staff is mandated to utilize the Service\u2019s organizational server EFS data to enhance managing, assessing, and displaying the health and worldwide disposition of U.S. Forces. Key deliverables include incrementally developed, operationally realistic capability enhancements focused on resource-informed planning and GFM sourcing functionality required by numerous Joint Staff requirements documents.\n\nThe Joint Staff Analytical Support (JSAS) enterprise force structure data integration efforts enables Project ORION: a Global Laydown Server and a Joint Force Capabilities Catalog along with functional applications that support a global visibility capability. This capability enhances resource-informed planning, global force management and joint deployment. Global visibility capability also supports future force integration and concept implementation needed to support timely and dynamic response to Combatant Commanders\u2019 contingency requirements. Project ORION creates a technical environment that enables rapid integration of the JOPES replacement with remaining GFM data that supports planning and execution of U.S. Military Operations. Project Orion provides operational force structure and the means to allocate and attach units. This capability is the cornerstone for fulfilling the CJCS-directed requirement to integrate force planning, support planning, and deployment planning and execution of military operations. The ORION environment supports all variants of planning and execution processes by providing portal access to authoritative data aggregated in the Global Laydown Servers and associated display of force capabilities, readiness, employment, and availability of the force. This is a cost-effective yet full spectrum approach to support and assist the Chairman in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities while improving current and future joint force management."

JIOR provides the capability to train and certify Cyber Mission Forces on the full spectrum of cyber weapons\/capabilities without risk of observation or fratricide. JIOR is accredited by DIA for operations at Unclassified through Top Secret-Special Compartment Information (TS-SCI) in a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) environment. JIOR is approved for use by Special Access Programs (SAP), Special Access Required Programs (SAR), and for Special Technical Operations (STO). JIOR provides Combatant Commands, Services and Agencies (C\/S\/A's) and key allied partners the ability to test deployment and gain insights into advanced cyberspace and Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities under current and future operational environments. JIOR integrates available cyberspace ranges with the training\/test communities providing access to low density\/high demand test and training resources including critical infrastructure, cyber targets, internet traffic, and opposing forces. JIOR supports Presidential policy and CJCS mandates for training, certification, and recertification of 6000+ cyber mission forces and DoD\/Interagency cyber vulnerability assessments. C\/S\/A's conduct hundreds of mission rehearsal, training, testing, and experimentation events on the JIOR annually."

The program resources Service and Special Operations Forces joint training to improve interoperability and create realistic tactical and operational joint training.  JNTC enables joint training for Combatant Commands and Services by developing joint training content and ensuring global distributed access. JNTC enabling capabilities support Services and USSOCOM requirements to provide trained and ready forces in support of Combatant Command operational requirements. This program focuses efforts on improving readiness and create a ready surge force consistent with Chairman\u2019s guidance.\n\nJKDDC:  Joint Knowledge Development & Distribution Capability (JKDDC) Joint Knowledge Online (JKO) is the program of record for online joint training that implements and operationalizes the OSD training transformation JKDDC.  JKO directly supports the CE2T2 program by developing, delivering, tracking, reporting, and supporting online training for Combatant Command exercises; Combatant Command required training; doctrinally based Joint Operations Core Curriculum; multinational, coalition, interagency training; OSD required training; and administration of the Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education program.  JKO expends RDT&E funding for leading edge technology review, market research, and integration to directly enhance various aspects of the training capability required to support Combatant Commanders, CE2T2 Program Goals and Objectives, and the Chairman's training guidance. JKO satisfies all requirements necessary to provide CE2T2 stakeholders with a distributed learning capability and access to web-based training content, learning resources, and distributed online training tools.\n\nAir Force JNTC:  Air Force JNTC funding provides a focused upgrade to develop models for space-based and cyber capabilities for integration into the Joint Live, Virtual, and Constructive (JLVC) environment as well supporting development of cross-domain solutions. Additionally, the Air Force invests in development of capabilities to enhance the rigor and fidelity of training for live and virtual members of joint training audiences.\n\nNavy JNTC:  These funds enable Navy to develop unique maritime capabilities that integrate JLVC elements into a seamless joint training environment. The Navy program activities include conducting research, development, and integration of a common, realistic, joint and coalition, operational to tactical level training architecture to deliver individual and collective constructive joint training for use in Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) events, CCDR exercises, Ballistic Missile Defense Exercises (BMDEX) certification events, and BMD at Sea training events in support of CCDR\u2019s training, deployment certification and operational requirements.\n\nJID: Joint Interoperability Division (JID) supports 35 annual schoolhouse interoperability courses and up to six CAPSTONE Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) courses tied to various Combatant Command (CCMD) joint exercises. JID trains CCMD, Services and partner nations' operations center personnel on interoperability planning tasks required during contingencies and exercises in emerging mission areas such as joint fires, net enabled weapons, remotely piloted aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and contested operations including secure internet with Link-16\/TDL equipped major weapon systems and smart bombs.\n\nMarine Corps JNTC:  These funds provide USMC stability and risk reduction to a variety of ongoing joint efforts focused on improving the fidelity and realism of training simulation systems that prepare Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) units for deployment in support of CCMD operations.  In support of the Commandant\u2019s planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance and support of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF) Bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  It also provides a single source training environment capability enabling users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, it also enhances pattern of life and indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers' ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into training scenarios. \n\nADL: The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative supports innovation and provides policy oversight to help the Services, Joint Staff, and partner agencies deliver training and education more efficiently and cost effectively. ADL provides policy oversight and coordination across DoD, coalition partners, and other Federal agencies for distributed learning. This oversight supports interagency interoperability and promotes personnel readiness, ensuring the right people receive the right training at the right time."

JKO is tasked to develop a DoD enterprise-wide, joint individual training toolkit of web-enabled individual and small group training products, services, and enabling training technology.  Products and services are developed in response to OSD program goals, CJCS high interest training issues, Joint Staff training priorities, and JKO stakeholders (Combatant Commands, Services, Combat Support Agencies, Interagency, and multinational partners) prioritized training requirements.  JKO supports a career-long joint learning continuum, joint professional military education, and tailored common training standards to Service members on tasks that are jointly executed.  JKO\u2019s research and development will improve all components of the Joint Content Management Architecture (JCMA) including:  \n\n1. JKO Learning Management System (LMS): Development and enhancement is required to integrate advanced individual and staff training technologies and methodologies with larger scale, collective training exercises, and modernize military training capability with a DoD enterprise-wide online training toolkit. There are currently over 3.6 million registered users of the JKO LMS.\n\n2. JKO Course Builder: JKO\u2019s Course Builder is a separate component used as a force multiplier for organizations to develop online content by both internal and external joint enterprise teams. Course Builder mitigates the need to have programmer\u2019s code Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) standards into content with automation that promotes fiscal efficiency as well as operational responsiveness. Course Builder will also support the new development methodology of micro-learning.    \n\n3.  Small Group Scenario Trainer (SGST) desktop modeling and simulation based training: This JKO capability trains and prepares thousands of military and civilian personnel deploying to Combatant Command theaters of operation prior to serving in their assigned Combined\/Joint Task Force (C\/JTF) billets. JKO integration of SGST simulation exercise scenarios and prerequisite JKO courses significantly enhance blended learning training support to large-scale, collective training exercises.\n\n4.  JKO Virtual Classroom (VClass):  JKO\u2019s new virtual classroom, or VClass, meets the need for an enhanced distributed learning capability with the introduction of a collaborative learning environment.  VClass is a customizable platform within JKO's architecture and will provide JKO elevated users the tools to meet the unique needs of DoD\u2019s training and education audience by providing online\/blended course support with syllabus, messaging, gradebook, resources, announcements and synchronous instructional forums.\n\n5. JKO mobile training development:  Development and enhancements in JKO\u2019s new approach to Responsive Design will significantly increase availability and access of web-based joint training content on portable, hand-held platforms (e.g. cell phones and tablets)."

Based on the Commandant's planning guidance, the Marine Corps will continue to improve performance of the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation in the areas of the JLVC-multi-resolution federation bridge, common database terrain data ingestion, and JLVC interoperability.  The MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also provides a single source training environment capability that enables users to select single or multiple play boxes (terrain data sets) for training simulation systems easing the burden of requesting terrain, 3D models, and other geographic layers into a single source. In addition to developing an exercise planning, design, implementation, execution, and control tool, the MAGTF Tactical Warfare Simulation also enhances pattern of life (PoL) \/ indigenous population modular service enabling exercise designers the ability to rapidly build new scenarios and incorporate human geography elements into the training scenarios."

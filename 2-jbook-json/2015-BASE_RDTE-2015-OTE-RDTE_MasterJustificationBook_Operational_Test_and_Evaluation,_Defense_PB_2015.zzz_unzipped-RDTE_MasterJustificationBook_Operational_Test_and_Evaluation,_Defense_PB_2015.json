The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     The approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Reporting results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n (IA and IOP)  of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfare capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for their capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises, administrative support services, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

The Director is responsible under Title 10 for policy and procedures for all aspects of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) within the Department of Defense (DoD).  Particular focus is given to OT&E that supports major weapon system production decisions for acquisition programs included on the Office of Secretary of Defense Test and Evaluation Oversight List that is prepared and approved annually.  Generally, there are about 300 programs on the oversight list including all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAIS).  MDAPs may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP) until OT&E of the program is complete.  DOT&E is involved early in the planning phase of each program to ensure adequate testing is planned and executed.  Key elements of DOT&E's oversight authority include: \n\n-     The approval of component Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS).\n-     The approval of component OT&E Test Plans (TPs).\n-     Oversight of Military Department preparation and conduct of field operational tests; analysis and evaluation of the resultant test data; the assessment of the adequacy of the executed test and evaluation programs; and assessment of the operational effectiveness and suitability of the weapon systems.\n-     Reporting results of OT&E that supports BLRIP decisions to the Secretary of Defense and Congress, as well as providing an annual report summarizing all OT&E activities and the adequacy of test resources within DoD during the previous fiscal year.\n-     The review and make recommendations to the Secretary of Defense on all budgetary and financial matters related to OT&E, including operational test facilities, resources and ranges.\n\n\n\nDOT&E also oversees and resources OT&E community efforts to plan and execute joint operational evaluations of information assurance and interoperability\n( IA and IOP) of fielded systems and networks during major Combatant Command (CCMD) and Service exercises, and reports the trends and findings in the annual report. \n\nDOT&E is also involved in increasing the capacity to access realistically advanced cyber warfighting capabilities to keep pace with heightened demand for those capabilities, advancing technologies and the growing cyber threat.\n\nThis Program Element includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) support in performing the described tasks, travel funds to carry out oversight of the OT&E and IA and IOP programs, funds for Service teams performing information assurance and interoperability assessments during exercises,  administrative support services, and engineering and technical support services related to the conduct of operational test and evaluation and exercise assessments."

                                                        "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP), and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG\/ME programs were realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP focuses on survivability improvements supporting aircraft acquisition and JTCG\/ME focuses on the lethality of currently fielded weapons systems; therefore, the two programs are more appropriately budgeted within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element.\n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC), the repository for aircraft survivability information.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD\u2019s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG\/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in operational weaponeering, strike mission planning, training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG\/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. \n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

                                                                        "val": "This Program Element consists of three programs:  Live Fire Test and Evaluation, Joint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) and Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME).  Starting in FY 2013 the JASP and JTCG\/ME programs were realigned from the Operational Test Activities and Analyses program element (0605814OTE) to the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element (0605131OTE).  The JASP focuses on survivability improvements supporting aircraft acquisition and JTCG\/ME focuses on the lethality of currently fielded weapons systems; therefore, the two programs are more appropriately budgeted within the Live Fire Test and Evaluation program element. \n\nThis Program Element directly supports the Congressional statutory requirements for oversight of Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  The primary objective of LFT&E is to assure that the vulnerability and survivability of Department of Defense (DoD) crew-carrying platforms and the lethality of our conventional munitions are known and acceptable before entering full-rate production.  LFT&E encompasses realistic tests involving actual United States (U.S.) and foreign threat hardware or, if not available, acceptable surrogate threat hardware.  The objective is to identify and correct design deficiencies early in the development process.  A completed LFT&E program and test report is required before programs proceed beyond low-rate initial production (BLRIP).  LFT&E also includes realistic modeling and simulation (M&S) to examine survivability and lethality attributes not assessed during testing.\n\nThis Program Element also supports DoD\u2019s Joint Live Fire (JLF) Program and other LFT&E related initiatives.  JLF was begun in 1984 under an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) charter to test fielded front-line combat aircraft and armor systems for their vulnerabilities as well as fielded weapons, both U.S. and foreign, for their lethality against their respective targets.  Funds are also used to support other initiatives related to quick reaction requests from theater and other areas of personnel survivability.\n\nThe Joint Aircraft Survivability Program is the DoD\u2019s focal point for joint service enhancement of military aircraft non-nuclear survivability.  The JASP is chartered by the commanders of the USN Naval Air Systems Command, USA Aviation and Missile Command and USAF Aeronautical Systems Center to coordinate and conduct RDT&E to improve military aircraft survivability, develop and standardize aircraft survivability modeling and simulation (M&S), facilitate information exchange on aircraft survivability and support aircraft survivability education for the DoD and U.S. aircraft community.  Each chartering command provides a senior aircraft survivability expert for the JASP Principal Members Steering Group (PMSG), which guides the program and approves projects for funding.  The JASP assesses and reports on combat damage incidents through the Joint Combat Assessment Team (JCAT), is the Executive Agent for the Joint Live Fire Aircraft Systems Program managed by the Live Fire Test office of DOT&E and is also an Executive Agent for the Survivability Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC), the repository for aircraft survivability information.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Commanders Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME) was chartered more than 40 years ago to serve as DoD\u2019s focal point for munitions effectiveness information.  This has taken the form of widely used Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs) which address all major non-nuclear U.S. weapons.  JTCG\/ME authenticates weapons effectiveness data for use in operational weaponeering, strike mission planning, training, systems acquisition, weapon procurement, and combat modeling and simulation.  JMEMs are used by the Armed Forces of the U.S., NATO, and other allies to plan operational missions, support training and tactics development, and support force-level analyses.  JTCG\/ME also develops and standardizes methodologies for evaluation of munitions effectiveness and maintains databases for target vulnerability, munitions lethality, and weapon system accuracy.  The JMEM requirements and development processes continues to be driven by operational lessons learned (Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Odyssey Dawn) and the needs of Combatant Commands, Services, Military Targeting Committee, and Operational Users Working Groups input for specific weapon-target pairings and methodologies. \n\nThis program element also includes funds to obtain Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) expertise in performing analyses in support of described Live Fire Test and Evaluation tasks, as well as travel funds to carry out the LFT&E, JASP and JTCG\/ME programs."

The oversight list is developed and published annually.\n\nJLF Programs and LFT&E Initiatives  \n\nConducted tests of fielded systems not previously tested under Air, Land, or Sea Joint Live Fire programs to support DOT&E and operator needs.  The need for these tests results from systems being exposed to new threats, used in new unanticipated tactics, or being operated in new combat environments, and the subsequent need for an assessment of their performance.  Continued efforts in support of Personnel Protection Equipment, including testing protocols for combat helmets and body armor.  Addressed urgent requests from theater that directly supported deployed Joint Combat Assessment Team investigation and report to operators. \n\nPerformed JLF projects to provide survivability data on currently fielded U.S. systems.  JLF Air projects tested the vulnerability of PT6 turboprop engines and evaluated the effects of internal configuration on helicopter crew compartment fires, as well as technologies\/techniques to reduce generic vulnerabilities to all aircraft, such as to MANPADS, small arms, and the performance of self-sealing fuel tanks using bio-fuels.  New projects investigated the effect of yawed projectiles and missile debris on aircraft vulnerability, the lethality of advanced projectile lethality, and a performed a comparison of commonly used test threats.  JLF Land projects continued to investigate the vulnerability of vehicles to underbody blast and the lethality of U.S. weapons against typical in-theater targets, and improved modeling and simulation tools by providing validation data.  New projects studied the use and validity of manikins, helmets, and improvements to material characteristics used in modeling and simulation.  JLF Sea projects continued to investigate ship vulnerabilities in the areas of commercial standards, equipment and component damage, and investigated vulnerabilities of designs and components for new ships.  New projects evaluated fire damage to ship components, including bulkheads, insulation, and reconfigurable spaces, investigated asymmetric boat threats, and began work on developing small boat vulnerability models.\n\nJoint Aircraft Survivability Program (JASP) \n\nIn FY 2013 the JASP continued work on 33 multi-year RDT&E projects and initiated 19 new projects approved by the JASP Principal Members Steering Group and OSD\/DOT&E.  In the area of susceptibility reduction, the JASP addressed improving the effectiveness and reducing the space, weight and power required for directed energy infrared countermeasures, electronic countermeasures technology and techniques, integrated aircraft survivability equipment, and aircrew situational awareness.  In the area of vulnerability reduction, the JASP continued to address requirements for lighter and more effective vulnerability reduction technology (e.g., armor, fuel containment, fire suppression, and aircrew and passenger protection).  In aircraft survivability Modeling and Simulation (M&S), the JASP continued to improve survivability M&S credibility, address operator requirements for survivability data, integrate DIA threat missile models into threat engagement codes, improve the assessment of aircrew and passenger injuries, and address M&S requirements identified by the joint aircraft survivability community.  The JASP completed 38 reports documenting efforts accomplished in FY 2013.\n\nThe JCAT continued to support the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy by assessing combat damage incidents, training operators on threat effects and combat damage assessment, and reporting their findings to combatant commanders and the DoD science and technology and acquisition communities.  The JASP continued supporting aircraft survivability education and information exchange through internet sites (restricted access and classified), by publishing the Aircraft Survivability Journal, developing educational materials and conducting training for the DoD and their contractors.\n\nJoint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG\/ME)\n\nJTCG\/ME Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual Weaponeering System (JWS) v2.1.1 software and JTCG\/ME generated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3160.01 Collateral Effects Radii (CER) tables were used for operational weaponeering and collateral damage estimation calls in direct support of operations in the AFRICOM and CENTCOM Areas of Responsibilities.  To provide continued support to operational commanders, DoD targeteers, weaponeers, and planners, the JTCG\/ME developed various analytical and operational methodologies and target geometric models.  Additionally JTCG\/ME\u2019s air-to-air and surface-to-air planning model, the Joint-Anti-air Combat Effectiveness System (J-ACE) v5.2 was released in September 2013 to provide aircraft survivability data.\n\nThe fielded JWS v2.1.1 contains the Fast Integrated Structural Tool (FIST).  FIST is the JMEM operational-level methodology that incorporates the integral modules from the Building Analysis Module (BAM) and Hardened Target Module (HTM) to create a merged tool that generates weapon effectiveness and damage assessments against infrastructure targets to include buildings, bunkers, and tunnels.   JWS v2.1.1 also contains approximately 180 new\/updated targets, 15 new\/updated munitions, new Explosive Equivalent Weights based on blast testing, and an improved 3-D viewer.  In addition, JWS v2.2 development is on-going to support coalition partners.  The JTCG\/ME in conjunction with the JWS Configuration Control Board and the JMEM Production Contractor (JPC) are implementing a re-marking effort in order to facilitate the documentary release of JWS.\n\nJ-ACE v5.2 simulates air-to-air and surface-to-air engagements.  Blue, Red, and Gray air-to-air missile (AAM) models; and, Red and Gray surface-to-air missile (SAM) flyout models are included.  J-ACE v5.2 provides updated Joint Anti-Air Model (JAAM) missile fly out model including hundreds of weapon target pairings and JAAM-Enhanced Surface-to-Air Missile Simulation (ESAMS) countermeasures interface.  J-ACE v5.2 also provides the new \u201cEndgame Manager (EM)\u201d software and data sets.  The EM is a new application which adds missile lethality and target vulnerability.  EM allows explicit evaluation of weapon miss distance, fuse performance, weapon lethality and target vulnerability.  EM provides the Probability of kill given an intercept (Pk\/i).  \n    \nTo more effectively support operational mission planning, particularly at USSTRATCOM, the J-ACE v5.2 release also provides a direct interface to force level simulations.  The fidelity is adequate for studying tactics, training evaluation, relative missile performance and scenario planning. \n\nIn support of the Combatant Commands and the CJCSI 3160.01, JTCG\/ME provided updates for CER values for newly fielded\/updated systems (e.g., M1130 Projectile, AGM-65-E2\/L and AGM-176-3\/2M).  In addition, the JTCG\/ME supported the Digital Precision Strike Suite (DPSS) Collateral Damage Estimation (DCiDE) tool for operational use.  This tool displays accredited Collateral Damage Estimate Level 1-5 A-C series effective radii reference tables.  Additionally, JTCG\/ME trained nearly 250 users at 10 different Commands to support Collateral Damage Estimation decisions.\n\nThe JTCG\/ME assessed fielded and emerging Information Operations (IO) systems as part of early efforts to create an Effects Based Operations (EBO) evaluation capability set.  The scope includes weapon characterization, coordinating test and target data development and providing operational tools for the IO elements of Computer Network Attack, Computer Network Defense, Military Information Support Operations (MISO) and Electronic Warfare.  This weapon effectiveness and associated confidence level data are critical enablers for application of these weapons as it will provide senior leaders and warfighters with information to develop policy and concepts of operations for their use."

The OTA&A programs consist of three activities:  Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E); Threat Systems (TS); and Center for Countermeasures (CCM).\n\nJoint Test and Evaluation complements the DoD Acquisition System by developing new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to improve the effectiveness of existing fielded systems.  JT&E projects are test and evaluation activities conducted in a joint military environment that develop process improvements.  These multi-Service projects, chartered by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the Joint Staff, appropriate combatant commanders, and the Services, provide nonmaterial solutions that improve: joint interoperability of Service systems, technical and operational concepts, joint operational issues,  development and validation of joint test methodologies, and test data for validating models, simulations, and test beds.  The JT&E projects address relevant joint war fighting issues in a joint test and evaluation environment by developing and providing new TTPs to improve joint test capabilities and methodologies.\n\nThreat Systems, based on a memorandum of agreement between the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Defense Intelligence Agency, provides DOT&E support in the areas of threat resource analysis, intelligence support and threat systems investments. Threat Systems provides threat resource analyses on the availability, capabilities and limitations of threat representations (threat simulators, targets, models, U.S. surrogates and foreign materiel) and analysis of test resources used for operational testing to support DOT&E\u2019s assessment of the adequacy of testing for those programs designated for oversight by DOT&E and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)).  Threat Systems provides DOT&E assessment officers and other DOT&E activities with program specific threat intelligence support. Threat Systems also funds management, oversight, and development of common-use threat specifications for threat simulators, threat representative targets, and digital threat models used for test and evaluation.\n\nThe Center for Countermeasures (The Center), a Joint Service Countermeasure (CM) Test and Evaluation Center, serves as DoD\u2019s independent evaluator for electro-optical systems with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, precision guided weapons (PGWs), CMs\/counter-countermeasures (CCMs) employment, and warning devices.  The Center conducts tests, analyzes test results and provides CM expertise that benefits the Services, Joint activities, T&E Agencies, DoD Acquisition Community, the Intelligence Community, Homeland Defense and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  Data collected during Center test activities provides valuable information to OSD assessment officers for select oversight programs.  The Center assesses current and developing systems, using carefully developed test and evaluation methodologies to provide the basis for understanding how CMs might affect systems used in current and future battlefields.  Additionally, the Center develops CM specific test equipment that can be used for both Title 10 Acquisition Systems and OCO urgent operational needs.\n\nThis Program Element is budgeted in Budget Activity 6, RDT&E Management Support, to support management activities for the DOTE oversight responsibilities of test and evaluation functions."

The JT&E staff and the program\u2019s stakeholders developed a concept of operations (CONOPS) in FY 2012 that provided the details of the new business model, based on the revised budget.  The most significant changes in the new model are shorter timelines for project development and execution, as well as the designation of permanent facilities to house test teams.  These two changes will allow test teams to share resources, as well as staff and execute new projects quickly.  Additionally, the selection cycles of the program\u2019s quick reaction tests and joint tests will be aligned so that the program\u2019s governing bodies will meet concurrently to maximize effectiveness and minimize travel costs.\n\nThe program had three joint tests close and four joint tests continue in the fiscal year.  One of the three tests to close was the Joint Integration of Maritime Domain Awareness for Homeland Defense Joint Test, which developed joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to synchronize information concerning the maritime domain for key decision markers across operations centers for homeland defense, completed in October 2012.  The next test to close, Joint Cyber Operations Joint Test, developed and evaluated tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the use of an adaptive cyber defense strategy for critical C2 services against cyber threats across the DoD Global Information Grid.  The third test that closed at the end of the fiscal year was the Joint Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Digital Information Exchange Joint Test, which developed joint tactics, techniques, and procedures to standardize the information exchange methods and dissemination paths to integrate UAS-derived information across the Services to support both deliberate and dynamic targeting requirements.\n\nThe program did not start any new joint tests in FY 2013 due to the lack of nominations that met the new submission guidelines.  The program did initiate ten quick reaction tests, which are short term projects directed to work on problems of limited scope.  The program also initiated one special project.  Four feasibility studies will be conducted in the second half of the fiscal year instead of the programmed two studies.  Out of the four studies, two will be selected to conduct joint tests to place the program on track for project execution in FY 2014.  \n\nThreat Systems\n\nThreat Systems continued test planning working group participation to identify threat shortfalls; conducted special studies and provided current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continued the development of Global Positioning Satellite jamming capabilities to increase threat realism at our test ranges, and continued the development of an ammunition and rocket propelled grenade signature model for use in hostile fire indicator systems. \n\nIn FY 2013, Threat Systems became the lead for implementing the threat M&S roadmap to ensure threats to US and Allied infrared countermeasure systems are available for testing.  Threat Systems established a formal configuration management system for the development, maintenance, anomaly resolution and distribution of threat performance models with tri-Service and Allied representation.  Threat Systems also initiated an investigation of ballistic missile related threats; began development of the follow-on next generation threat GPS jammer; and identified representative cyber warfare threats for testing.  In addition, Threat Systems managed a series of technical analyses of WESTPAC threats by each of the Intelligence Production Centers to determine characteristics the test community needs to adequately emulate current threats and their densities in potential engagements.\n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center completed over 50 T&E activities and analyzed and reported on more than 40 different systems, with special emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CM\/CCM employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs.  Most programs supported received an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for their CM\/CCM evaluations.  Approximately 49% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on aircraft survivability equipment (ASE) testing; with the majority of these efforts in support of rotary wing aircraft.  About 11% of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on PGW, foreign systems, and other types of field testing not related to ASE.  Approximately 6% of the Center\u2019s efforts were dedicated to OCO support, with emphasis on CM\u2013based, pre-deployment training for rotary wing units.  Thirty two percent of the Center\u2019s efforts were spent on internal programs to improve test capabilities and to develop test methodologies for new types of T&E activities, much of which was accomplished in concert with the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP).  Programs include the CTEIP-sponsored, Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasure Test System (JMITS), Towed Aerial Plume Simulator (TAPS) and Multi-Spectral Sea and Land Target Simulator (MSALTS).  The Center is expanding in the electronic warfare (EW) realm with a new internally funded Portable Range Threat Simulator (PRTS) capability.  These systems, as well as the new remote launch systems (RLS) and the Hostile Fire Signature (HSIG) Models, will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and OCO ASE urgent operational needs.  Our support was distributed across all the Services, as well as intelligence agencies and research and development activities.\n\nAbout 2% of the Center\u2019s efforts consisted of providing subject matter expertise and other support not directly related to scheduled test activities.

The Joint Advanced Capability Employment Joint Test, anticipated to close in August 2014, will to develop and test tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the joint task force commander to employ advanced capabilities to overcome complex targeting challenges.  The Joint Deployable Integrated Air and Missile Defense Joint Test, scheduled to close in June 2014, will develop, test, and evaluate tactics, techniques, and procedures to enable the joint task force commander to employ integrated deployable air, cruise missile, and theater ballistic missile defense capabilities.\n\nFour new feasibility studies will be conducted in FY 2014, two of which will be selected to conduct joint tests.\n\nThreat Systems\n\nBeginning in FY 2014, Threat Systems will re-scope its DOT&E-funded investment program.  This action will eliminate the technical threat analyses needed for the development of modern and advanced threat test assets which are currently test limitations for electronic warfare and advanced avionics programs.  All other Threat Systems support will continue. \n\nThreat Systems will continue test planning working group participation and perform technical analyses to identify threat shortfalls; conduct special studies and provide current intelligence support tailored to specific U.S. weapon systems acquisitions; continue managing intelligence \u201cdeep dives\u201d to produce intelligence in sufficient detail to develop new threat test assets; operate and maintain the modeling and simulation configuration control board for threat models and simulation used in test facilities; and continue the development and implementation of a tri-Service and Allied threat M&S roadmap to ensure infrared countermeasure systems have sufficient threat test assets.  Threat Systems will propose, manage and oversee threat test assets that support DOT&E-identified threat shortfalls, identifying candidate threat systems from the various intelligence agencies for possible development of models for use in test and evaluation.  Threat Systems will also continue efforts to maintain a standard set of threat performance models and incorporate the initial hostile fire indicator model for small arms and RPGs for use in test and evaluation facilities and continue investigating ballistic missile related threats.  \n\nThese activities help DOT&E carry out its Title 10 responsibilities to assess test adequacy and determine whether testing is realistic and suitable, and promotes common solutions to Service threat representation needs.\n\nThe Center\n\nThe Center will test, analyze, and report on more than 30 systems, with emphasis on rotary wing survivability, CMs\/CCMs employment, warning and targeting systems, and PGWs.  Each program supported will receive an independent assessment of our data\/findings and test support for CM\/CCM evaluations.  The Center will continue to emphasize support of the DOT&E enterprise, with a clear focus on Title 10 weapons systems, aircraft survivability and hostile fire initiatives.  It will continue to conduct ongoing investigations towards determining and filling the gaps in EW and multimode system testing.  In addition to these test activities, the Center will continue to provide CM expertise in pre-deployment events and training, as well as CM\/CCM-focused tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) development.  The Center will complete the initial development of the CTEIP-sponsored MSALTS, which will be used in support of testing for both Title 10 programs and ASE urgent operational needs.  The Center will work with CTEIP and AEDC on the development of JSIS to add enhanced data collection for radiometric events. The Center will complete the development of a new RLS capable of launching larger diameter missiles.  The Center plans to complete development of the PRTS, expanding its output power and our capability to support multimode guidance T&E.  The Center will continue working with the Threat Simulator Working Group (TSWG)-sponsored HSIG model.

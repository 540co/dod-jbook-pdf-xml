It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, biological and materials sciences.\n\n     The Bio\/Info\/Micro Sciences project will explore and develop potential technological breakthroughs that exist at the intersection of biology, information technology and micro\/physical systems to exploit advances and leverage fundamental discoveries for the development of new technologies, techniques and systems of interest to the DoD.  Programs in this project will draw upon information and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple biological architectures and functions, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. \n\n     The Math and Computer Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in new computational models and mechanisms for reasoning and communication in complex, interconnected systems.  The project is exploring novel means to exploit computer capabilities; enhance human-to-computer and computer-to-computer interaction technologies; advance innovative computer architectures; and discover new learning mechanisms and innovations in software composition.  It is also fostering the computer science academic community to address the DoD's need for innovative computer and information science technologies.  Additionally, this project explores the science of mathematics for potential defense applications.\n\n      The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security.  Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems.  Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue.   The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects.\n\n     The Electronic Sciences project explores and demonstrates electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will provide: 1) new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near-real time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near-real time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities.\n\n     The Materials Sciences project is concerned with the development of: high power density\/high energy density mobile and portable power sources; processing and design approaches for nanoscale and\/or bimolecular materials, interfaces and microsystems; and materials and measurements for molecular-scale electronics.\n\n     The Transformative Sciences project supports scientific research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in the areas of computing and the computing-reliant subareas of social sciences, life sciences, manufacturing, and commerce as a means of improving military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging converging trends."

Using this understanding, the program will develop powerful new symbolic computational capabilities for the DoD in a mathematical system that provides the ability to understand complex and evolving tasks without exponentially increasing software and hardware requirements.  This includes a comprehensive mathematical theory to extract and leverage information in signals at multiple acquisition levels, which would fundamentally generalize compressive sensing for multi-dimensional sources beyond domains typically used.  New insights related to signal priors, task priors, and adaptation will enable these advances.  This program will establish a functional mathematical basis on which to build future advances in cognitive neuroscience, computing capability, and signal processing across the DoD.  The quantitative models of learning and memory will also lead to improvements in the training of individuals and teams as well as advances in cognitive rehabilitation (e.g. PTSD)."

This program focuses on speculative technologies for greatly enhancing microsystems technologies and defense sciences.  The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and National Security issues.  Beginning in 2013, YFA technical topic areas are more closely tied to programs currently underway at DARPA and to recently identified DoD and National Security needs.  The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community.  Current activities include research in thirteen topic areas spanning from Quantum Science and Technology to Robotics and Supervised Autonomy, Mathematics, Computing, and the interface of Engineering and Biology.  A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs."

SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups.  These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior.  SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming\/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices.

The objective of the UPSIDE program is to create a high-level, non-Boolean computational model and map it directly to the unique functional properties of new emerging devices to achieve significant increases in power efficiency and performance.  The UPSIDE program will create a new generation of computing structures that will, in turn, enable revolutionary advances in ISR processing, particularly for DoD applications of embedded, real-time sensor data analysis.  Because Boolean data representations are inherently power-inefficient for many datasets, particularly those produced by noisy analog real-time sensors, the UPSIDE program will establish an unconventional, non-Boolean, computing paradigm to enable new and needed capabilities in the area of sensor data analysis. \n\nUPSIDE intends to implement this new computing paradigm in the form of a specialized hardware component termed the inference module (IM).  The inference module will be first developed through simulation, and then implemented using mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), as well as using state of the art emerging (non-CMOS) devices.  Throughout the program, the inference module will be benchmarked using a DoD relevant image processing pipeline, to verify gains in both computing throughput and power efficiency.  The result will be a computing infrastructure and functional implementations that demonstrate three orders of magnitude improvement in processing speed and four orders of magnitude improvement in power efficiency.  These gains will constitute a disruptive new level of embedded computational efficiency for future real-time sensor systems."

Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD-relevant scenarios.  In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph.  Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy:  the composition of real-world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution).  In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed.  This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set that characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time."

Networked computing systems control significant elements of critical national infrastructure, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems.  During the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal\/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and lone miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number.  The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD resilience in the face of adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems.  Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area.  Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects."

Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability.  Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip,\" for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis.  These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices."

Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.  The radiation dose required for imaging will also be reduced.\n\nThe Basic Research component of this effort will focus on defining the fundamental science necessary for the creation of compact and highly efficient synchrotron X-ray sources.  These sources may lead to future developments in the  imaging field based on tunable x-ray wavelengths.  This program also has related applied research efforts funded under PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions, such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources over a range of gas pressures.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different approaches.\n\nThe Basic Research part of this effort is focused on fundamental MPD research and will advance scientific knowledge based on the study of several key MPD design parameters.  These parameters include ultra-high pressure and carrier densities regimes.  MPD will focus on expanding the design space for plasma devices enabling revolutionary advances in microplasma device performance.  It is expected that MPD will develop innovative concepts and technologies that are clearly disruptive with respect to the current state of the art.  Fundamental scientific knowledge derived from MPD is also expected to drive developments in commercialization of MPD technology developed and funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

It combines the expertise and resources from select defense, semiconductor, and information companies with those of DARPA to sponsor an academic base focused on specific technology requirements set by experts in industry and DARPA.  The program will involve close collaboration between these experts and the academic base with industry providing 60% of program funding matched by 40% from DARPA.  For industry, leveraging funding and expertise with both other companies and DARPA to solve common technical hurdles in a pre-competitive research model is highly attractive.  From the government perspective this kind of model also provides unique insight into the directions future commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies will be taking.  This perspective assists DARPA in defining the technology gaps where the DoD can make the most out of its limited resources by investing in those areas where the largest technology discrimination can be achieved.  This discrimination is key to expanding technological superiority of the United States DoD.\n\nResearch in STARNet is divided into a discovery thrust (ACCEL) and an integration thrust (NEXT) focused on combining current or emerging technologies to provide new capabilities.  ACCEL includes projects governed by virtual academic centers discovering new material systems, devices, and novel computing\/sensing architectures.  NEXT involves projects on advanced analog and mixed signal, complex system design tools, and alternative computing architectures.  As the projects in ACCEL mature it is expected that they will replace the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based efforts currently in NEXT.  \n\nThe STARNet program is unique. It creates a community where industry and government participate as co-sponsors to guide and learn from a large academic research base, with DoD shaping the goals to have direct impact on important long-range DoD problems.  STARNet has a 5-year duration.  It is expected that industry and DARPA will continuously evaluate STARNet and their respective challenges to determine if another collaborative program is warranted at the conclusion of the 5-year term."

Technical challenges include loss of information due to quantum decoherence, limited communication distance due to signal attenuation, protocols, and larger numbers of quantum bits (qubits) and their entanglement.  A key challenge has been to integrate improved single and entangled photon and electron sources and detectors into quantum computation and communication networks.  Error correction codes, fault tolerant schemes, and longer decoherence times were addressed.  Expected impacts include highly secure communications, algorithms for optimization in logistics, highly precise measurements of time and position on the earth and in space, and new image and signal processing methods for target tracking."

Arrays of engineered nanoscale devices will result in an order of magnitude (10 to 100 times) reduction in the time required for analysis and identification of known and unknown (engineered) molecules.  This program will develop novel nanomaterials for exquisitely precise purification of materials, enabling such diverse applications as oxygen generation and desalination, ultra-high sensitivity magnetic sensors, and correlated electron effects such as superconductivity.  Additionally, this program will compare the phenomenology of various biological, physical and social systems and abstract the common features that are responsible for their properties of self-organization, emergent behavior, and physical intelligence.  Finally, this program will develop stabilization and scale-up methods to fabricate high pressure crystal structures within domains not previously possible.  This offers the promise to exploit the incredible properties of high pressure phases (e.g, hardness for armor) using economically viable manufacturing approaches."

A new all optical switch capability will also be investigated.  It includes a new, non-invasive method to directly hyperpolarize biological tissues, leading to novel quantitative neurodiagnostics.  New materials and prototype devices will be developed to demonstrate a new class of optoelectronics that operate with ultra-low energy dissipation (~100 atom-Joules (aJ)\/operation).

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the tools, technologies, and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e. those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms) leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g. flouropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g. self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to facilitate new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains that are vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nIf successful, Living Foundries will do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry: enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities.  Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, develops and yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction, and standardization of both processes and components.  The result will be rapid design, construction, implementation and testing of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability.  Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing the extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built.  Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design and modeling; automated, modular and standardized fabrication and genome-scale engineering processes; modular regulatory elements, devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation, and debugging.  Applied research for this program begins in FY 2013 in PE 0602715E, project MBT-02."

The U.S. military is increasingly involved with societies plagued by such seemingly self-perpetuating evils.  Problems in this class often include social, cultural, ideological, political, and economic constraints, and consequently stakeholders with radically differing world views and frames of reference.  Limited U.S. patience for long-term engagements and interconnectedness with other similarly complex problems further characterize the challenge.  Social networking has shown initial promise for problems of this nature, such as bribery, though on a smaller scale.  The Networked Approaches to Intractability program will develop social networking-based applications that incorporate recent breakthroughs in game theory and multi-party negotiation to break vicious social cycles and create virtuous social cycles.  The program seeks approaches to modeling and reasoning about problems of this nature, incentive mechanisms to elicit relevant information from stakeholders, and the creation of tools for combatant commanders and stakeholders collaboratively addressing such challenges."

Applications include sensors for conventional indoor\/outdoor environments (buildings, transportation, and materiel), environmental monitoring over large areas, and simplified diagnosis, treatment, and health monitoring in the field. The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience. These transient electronics ideally should perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or sensitive to the environment.  VAPR will build an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  Applied research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.\n\nA basis set of transient materials and electronic components with sufficient electronic and transience performance is needed to realize transient electronic systems for environmental sensing and biomedical applications. Research and development of novel materials for implementing basic transient electronic components (i.e. actives and passives), power supply strategies, substrates and encapsulates as well as development of modes and triggers for transience will form the core of fundamental research activities.  Transient components and devices developed in this technical area will form the basis for advanced functional circuit blocks and test systems to be developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

A social compiler which views people, computer, and network ensembles as elements of a single architecture and enables crowd sourced developers to write social programs in a high-level language would automatically decompose the task and organize, incentivize, and outsource appropriate aspects to peer production.  The resulting social computing systems could be applied both within the military and across larger communities to achieve capabilities ranging from highly responsive development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to open-source intelligence and strategic communications."

Programs in this project address the Department's identified medical gaps in taking care of the warfighter such as blast-induced traumatic brain injury.  Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis."

Efforts will draw upon the information, computational modeling and physical sciences to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels.  This project will establish a fundamental understanding of brain function, short-term memory and the mechanism(s) of injury induced by exposure to blast.  Basic research that aims at new methods and medical devices includes the ability to perform in-theater, continuous analysis of a warfighter's health as a preventative measure to mitigate widespread disease and development of biomaterials that allow long-term interfaces with neural tissue, electronics that provide sound attenuation and processes to remove harmful bacteria and their toxins in blood to prevent sepsis."

This will require an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation.  Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization.  These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain.  Further, modeling of the brain will progress to an unprecedented level with this novel approach. A key aspect of this effort will be to develop non-invasive bioimaging techniques that are capable of rapid analysis and interpretation of brain tissue alterations including new methods of analysis and interpretation for measuring brain tissue alterations at the cellular scale."

ADEPT will develop and exploit synthetic biology for the in vivo creation of nucleic acid circuits that continuously and autonomously sense and respond to changes in physiologic state and for novel methods to target delivery, enhance immunogenicity, or control activity of vaccines, potentially eliminating the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo.  ADEPT advancements to control cellular machinery include research to optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status.  ADEPT will develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of-care), in-garrison or deployed.  Additionally, ADEPT will develop techniques that will enable the rapid establishment of transient immunity through stimulation of the production of components of the immune system to impart effective but temporary protection.  This transient immunity would bridge the time gap between the delivery of a vaccine and the development of a long term protective immune response.

Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen.  Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide a faster ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater.  Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection.  Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities.  New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care.  In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training.  Advanced information-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare and the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics."

Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield.  While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding.  A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control.  This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location.  Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics.  Creating a \"pharmacy on demand\" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them.  Another effort will develop assessment tools to identify soldiers in real time who represent depression and suicide risk by identifying speech biomarkers.  This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations)."

This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional and cellular level interactions.  This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems.

The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.\n\nApplied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis.  Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.

The Warrior Web program will mitigate that impact by developing an adaptive, quasi-active, joint support sub-system that can be integrated into current soldier systems.  Because this sub-system will be compliant and be transparent to the user, it will reduce the injuries sustained by warfighters while allowing them to maintain performance.   Success in this program will require the integration of component technologies in areas such as regenerative kinetic energy harvesting to offset power\/energy demands; human performance, system, and component modeling; novel materials and dynamic stiffness; actuation; controls and human interface; and power distribution\/energy storage.  The final suit is planned to weigh no more than 9kg and require no more than 100W of external power.  Allowing the warfighter to perform their missions with reduced risk for injuries will have immediate effects on mission readiness, soldier survivability, mission performance and the long-term health of our veterans.  This effort was previously funded in the Maintaining Combat Performance Thrust in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02."

Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control.  This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function."

The program will follow high-risk populations of service members to elucidate injury from both isolated and repeated events.  Service members in the program are tested with a combination of imaging and neurocognitive functional exams prior to training, after training workup-but before deployment, and again after deployment.  During training and deployed operations the service members wear blast dosimetry systems to document any exposures.  All exposures are analyzed through detailed 3-dimensional reconstructions, combined with medical evaluations and testing records to determine the complex relationships between mechanical properties of blasts and the initiation of pathophysiologic responses.  This effort builds on the successful deployment of the Blast Gauge measurement system in association with clinical indices of neurologic and psychiatric status to define a quantifiable relationship between timing and intensity of blast exposures and development and recovery of physiologic and clinic changes in an active duty population exposed to repetitive sub-clinical blast exposures and at an increased risk of involvement in clinically significant blast events."

PREVENT used a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion.  Research worked to create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempted to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury.  Raw data was collected from in-theater blast gauges, along with medical and event reports to form a comprehensive analysis.  As part of the mitigation and treatment strategy, candidate therapeutics were tested in order to alleviate inflammation from both acute and chronic injury."

These technologies will lead to new multi-generation product lines of commercially viable, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications; it will include supercomputer, embedded computing systems, and novel design tools for manufacturing of defense systems.\n\n     The Information Assurance and Survivability project is developing the technology required to make emerging information system capabilities (such as wireless and mobile code\/mobile systems) inherently secure, and to protect DoD's mission-critical systems against attack upon or through the supporting information infrastructure.  These technologies will enable our critical systems to provide continuous correct operation even when they are attacked, and will lead to generations of stronger protection, higher performance, and more cost-effective security and survivability solutions scalable to several thousand sites.  \n\n     The Language Translation project will develop and test powerful new Human Language Technology that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of national security needs.  This technology will enable systems to a) automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means; b) to have two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation; c) enable automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text along with content summarization; and d) enable exploitation of captured, foreign language hard-copy documents.\n\n     The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems.  This involves networking, people, platforms, weapons sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past."

One of the major challenges currently facing the DoD is the prohibitively high cost, time, and expertise required to build large complex software systems.  Powerful new approaches and tools are needed to enable the rapid and efficient production of new software, including software that can be easily changed to address new requirements and can adjust dynamically to platform and environmental perturbations.  The project will ensure accessibility and usability to a wide range of application developers, not just computational science experts.

Such a \"fab-less\" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream re-programmability, with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects.  Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five to ten---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems."

The iFAB vision is to move away from wrapping a capital-intensive manufacturing facility around a single defense product, and toward the creation of a flexible, programmable, potentially distributed production capability able to accommodate a wide range of systems and system variants with extremely rapid reconfiguration timescales.  The specific goals of the iFAB program are to rapidly design and configure manufacturing capabilities to support the fabrication of a wide array of infantry fighting vehicle models and variants.\nOnce a given design is developed and verified, iFAB aims to take the formal META design representation and automatically configure a digitally-programmable manufacturing facility, including the selection of participating manufacturing facilities and equipment, the sequencing of the product flow and production steps, and the generation of computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine instruction sets as well as human instructions and training modules.  iFAB is mostly an information architecture.  Only the final assembly capability needs to be co-located under a single roof in anything resembling a conventional fabrication facility; the rest of iFAB can be geographically distributed and can extend across corporate and industrial boundaries, united only by a common model architecture and certain rules of behavior and business practices.  The final assembly node of the iFAB facility for infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) is currently slated to be at the Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center at the Rock Island Arsenal."

The program will develop novel in-situ prognostication and health monitoring techniques applicable to complex air and space platforms.  The program will develop tractable approaches to predict, identify, and respond to failures endemic to complex systems such as failure cascades, destructive emergent behavior, and off-nominal responses.  To accomplish this, the program will leverage recent advances in adaptive control for fault isolation and mitigation. Adaptive Integrated Reliability will culminate with installation of the integrated reliability management system on a complex air or space platform and demonstrate 2X reliability improvement via accelerated lifecycle testing with representative stimuli.  This reliability enhancement capability will enable development of a new generation of dependable complex systems and enable the compression of system test timelines by trading off testing for lifecycle reliability.  The requisite design and production tools and techniques developed in the program will have immediate application to space systems and aircraft programs."

However, the DoD consumes a very small percentage of the total IC production in the world.  As a result of the globalization of the IC marketplace, much of the advanced IC production has moved to offshore foundries, and these parts make up the majority of ICs used in today's military systems.\n\nWithout the ability to influence and regulate the off-shore fabrication of ICs, there is a risk that parts acquired for DoD systems may not meet stated specifications for performance and reliability.  This risk increases considerably with the proliferation of counterfeit ICs in the marketplace, as well as the potential for the introduction of malicious circuits into a design.\n\nThrough the IRIS program, DARPA seeks to develop techniques that will provide system developers the ability to derive the function of digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs non-destructively, given limited operational specifications.  These techniques will include advanced imaging and device recognition of deep sub-micron Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, as well as computational methods to solve the NP-complete problem of determining device connectivity.\n\nFinally, the IRIS program will produce innovative methods of device modeling and analytic processes to determine the reliability of an IC by testing a limited number of samples.  The current understanding of IC aging mechanisms, including negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and electromigration (EM) will be leveraged to develop unique diagnostic test techniques."

Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers.  However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself.  Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time."

This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and compute an encrypted search result without decrypting the query.  This technology will advance the capability to run programs on untrusted hardware while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential.  This mitigates the important aspect of supply chain compromise."

The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices.  This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance.  This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power.  Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints.  Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs.  Systems that admit static verification can provide both high assurance and high performance to avoid the many dynamic checks otherwise necessary to provide high assurance.  The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications."

The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means.  Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples.  The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions.  Such tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation.  Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of strategic intelligence.  Such strategic applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation.  Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time."

To accomplish this, DEFT will develop and apply formal representations for basic facts, spatial, temporal, and associative relationships, causal and process knowledge, textually entailed information, and derived relationships and correlated actions\/events.  DEFT inputs may be in English or in a foreign language and sources may be completely free-text or semi-structured reports, messages, documents, or databases.

The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that will convert such captured documents from Arabic into readable English in the field.  MADCAT will substantially improve applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition\/optical handwriting recognition.  MADCAT will tightly integrate these improved technologies with translation technology and create prototypes for field trials."

Technologies to be developed and integrated may include anomaly detection, big data analytics, case-based reasoning, heuristics, game theory, and stochastic optimization.  The CWCS capability is needed because highly-scripted, distributed cyber attacks exhibit speed, complexity, and scale that exceed the capability of human cyber defenders to respond in a timely manner.  A CWCS prototype system should be capable of competing at a high level in cyber competitions."

C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that produce uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable.  With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting.

The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. \n\nThe Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered.  These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention.\n\nThe Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies.  This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces.  Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications."

A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity.  Current manipulation systems have many limitations.  For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires.  ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction).

Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries are being developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics, and user feedback.  Apps, together with handhelds and networks, are tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments.  Performance and usage are carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.  The effort is creating a military apps development community by reaching out to non-traditional performers and will explore new models for software acquisition based on end-user empowerment."

DCAPS recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance and so incorporates strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data.  The program is also developing partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program, the Army Telemedicine & Advanced Technologies Research Center, and the National Center for TeleHealth and Technology.  This effort is funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013."

Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.

This project funds programs supporting revolutionary new approaches to biological warfare (BW) defense and is synergistic with efforts of other Government organizations.\n\nEfforts to counter the BW threat include countermeasures to stop pathophysiologic consequences of biological or chemical attack, host immune response enhancers, medical diagnostics for the most virulent pathogens and their molecular mechanisms, collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping, tactical and strategic biological and chemical sensors, and integrated defensive systems.  This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability."

This program also includes development of a unique set of platform technologies and medical countermeasures synthesis that will dramatically decrease the timeline from military threat detection to countermeasure availability."

Emphasis was placed on discovery and development of technologies that allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated threats, whether naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack, to significantly decrease the time needed to produce candidate vaccine.  Additionally, new technologies were developed to allow the rapid, cost-effective manufacture of complex therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine antigens; these technologies reduced the time for biologics manufacture from years (or even decades) to only weeks.  Select efforts funded under Unconventional Therapeutics transferred to the Medical Program Element 0602115E, in FY 2012."

The analysis system integrated high-resolution separation and spectroscopic techniques with automated analysis software to enable identification and ranking (by concentration) of all components present in complex gas mixtures.  Reproducible analysis of atmospheric samples using sophisticated analytical technology yielded data for baseline conditions, natural variability, and permit detections of nefarious anomalies associated with production, movement, and storage of weapons, even under shifting backgrounds driven by meteorological and seasonal events."

By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional manned ship design constraints in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction.  The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time.  When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.  Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system."

Due to retreating Arctic ice in the coming decades there is an expectation for increased shipping traffic during the summer months, and increased interest in exploiting natural resources along the Arctic continental shelf.  This growth in activity will increase the strategic significance of the region, and will drive the need to ensure stability through effective regional monitoring.  The extreme environmental conditions of the Arctic may challenge the effectiveness of conventional technology to provide such monitoring.  As such, this program seeks to exploit unique physical attributes and emergent environmental trends in the Arctic to create surprising new capabilities, and will develop technologies for persistent and affordable sensing and communication both above and below the ice to ensure responsive operations."

The UFP approach centers on pre-deploying deep-ocean nodes years in advance in forward operating areas which can be commanded from standoff to launch to the surface.  Advances in miniaturized sensors and processors, the explosive growth in the variety of small unmanned systems, and the advances in autonomy and networking all point toward highly-capable, yet affordable distributed systems.  Currently, large numbers of distributed unmanned systems are not utilized in far-forward areas due to logistics and distance, the need for delivery platforms, and the associated latency for insertion.  The UFP program will remove this barrier to accelerate large-scale unmanned distributed applications and missions.  The presumption is that a wider range of technology options and system solutions will emerge when the barriers to deployment are removed."

The program seeks to create an open-source development infrastructure for the aggregation of designer inputs applicable to complex electromechanical systems as well as software, and to exercise this infrastructure with a series of design challenges, leading to prize awards and builds of winning designs in a foundry-style, rapidly configurable manufacturing facility.  The design challenges will culminate in a complete build of a next generation infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) to a requirements set loosely analogous to an existing program of record, but executed on a roughly one-year timescale."

This technology will improve the performance of robots that operate in the rough terrain and austere conditions characteristic of disasters, and use vehicles and tools commonly available in populated areas.  This technology will work in ways easily understood by subject matter experts untrained in the operation of robots and be governed by intuitive controls that require little training.   The program will also meet the global need for resilience against natural disasters and industrial accidents, and increase the resilience of infrastructure against acts of terrorism.\n\nThe primary goal of the Robotics Challenge program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments.  The program will focus on robots that can utilize available human tools, ranging from hand tools to vehicles.  The program aims to advance the key robotic technologies of supervised autonomy, mounted mobility, dismounted mobility, dexterity, strength, and platform endurance.  Supervised autonomy will be developed to allow robot control by non-expert operators, to lower operator workload, and to allow effective operation despite low fidelity (low bandwidth, high latency, intermittent) communications.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces."

This level of overmatch is not enjoyed at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level, however.  The goal of the IS2 program is to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad that is 10x more mission capable.  The concept of overmatch at the squad level includes increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales.  IS2 will explore advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and advanced single soldier aerial transport approaches and technologies.  This end result of the IS2 program is an individual dismount outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve one-on-one overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create a new Hybrid Squad unit."

These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur will provide the technology foundation for the defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, and against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitudes and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include: multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will develop the core set of laser components for efficiently driving elements of high-power electronically steerable optical arrays, namely: high-power coherently- and spectrally-combinable fiber laser amplifiers, high-brightness laser diodes for efficiently pumping the fiber laser amplifiers, and kW-class single-mode laser diode arrays.  In addition, advanced techniques (packaging, thermal and power management, beam control, target tracking, etc.) will be developed for light-weight, high power fiber-laser based and podded High Energy Laser Countermeasure (HELCM) systems enabling near-term options for low-altitude aircraft self-defense against MANPADS.  The vulnerabilities of MANPADS and other surface-to-air missiles, as well as their potential to incorporate counter-countermeasures to HELCM systems will also be measured and assessed.  These techniques and measurements will be designed to work in tandem with, and to support, the HELCM prototype subsystems developed under the Budget Activity 3 Excalibur program in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.\n\nThe Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will also conduct several analytical studies relevant to scaling and applications of high-efficiency (30% - 40% wall plug efficient) high power electric lasers that will examine: the potential to scale the output power of diode pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) to tactical and strategic levels (100's kW - MW class); the potential for integrating low-cost, high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view imaging seekers and directional acoustic cueing into locating extended-altitude MANPADS; and the potential to use high power fiber lasers for long range target identification and tracking."

The overarching objectives of InSPIRE are twofold:  (1) to leverage the human presence in space for rapid, iterative experimentation and design of DoD-relevant space capabilities, and (2) to provide the next generation of scientists and engineers with experience in carrying out meaningful space experimentation economically, over reasonable time scales.  InSPIRE will enhance the ability to rapidly mature and insert new technologies into national security space assets.  The InSPIRE program will expand on the capabilities developed through SPHERES by developing a SPHERES-II infrastructure, adding arms, manipulator hands, and hard docking ports.  InSPIRE will also design a new generation of Spherelets.  Spherelets development will test satellite constructs where small satellite modules self-assemble into larger operational space structures, such as telescopes.  In addition, the InSPIRE program will continue the SPHERES Zero Robotics Challenge competition among high schools and middle schools across the United States."

With a weight goal of <5 kg\/kW, HELLADS will enable high energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft, and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, enabling high precision, low collateral damage, and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary prototype unit cell laser module.  That unit cell demonstrated power output and is demonstrating optical wavefront performance that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact 150 kW high energy tactical laser weapon system.  Two unit cell module designs with integrated power and thermal management systems were fabricated and tested; they demonstrated an output power exceeding 34 kW.  Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be replicated and connected to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.  The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems all based upon existing technologies to produce a ground-based laser weapon system field demonstrator.  The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment.  Additional funding for this integration effort is provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E.  The HELLADS laser will be transitioned following testing to a tactical platform for performance demonstration of ground, sea, or airborne precision engagements."

The enabling technologies of interest include hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, stowable wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight materials, and advanced sensors and flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight.  TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units.

The program will lead to ground and flight tests of a technology demonstrator aircraft.  Program goals include demonstrating flight speeds in excess of 300 kts, while simultaneously retaining and proving enhanced hover and hot\/high operation that are key and unique to VTOL flight.  Improvements in aircraft productivity indices that are reflective of meaningful gains in military transport efficiencies of the system will be a key focus of the program.  Considerations will include alternative (for example, non-rotary wing) air vehicle configurations that embrace efficient new designs when addressing lift offset, propulsive compounding, and other solution spaces.  A strong emphasis will be placed on the development of elegant, multi-functional subsystem technologies that demonstrate net improvements in aircraft efficiencies that will be exemplified on the basis of defined productivity metrics.  Additionally, the program will design and demonstrate new concepts of adaptable landing gear to enable operations from irregular landing zones and moving launch\/recovery platforms.  Furthermore, novel electric power generation, motors, and distributed propulsion systems will also be studied in detail for future VTOL applications, including thrust and control authority augmentation, and power on demand.  The VTOL Technology Demonstrator will demonstrate the mission utility of the new technologies to enable previously un-executable missions and new concepts of operation."

DARPA will conduct a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explore potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study will consider roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated system of systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systesms that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative platform concepts for airframe, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features will be explored as a central part of the concept definition effort.  This effort will also explore the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA will present technical challenges to Industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions.  Enabling technologies are next generation platforms, advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.  Early planning for future technologies will also help to define the funding baselines for DOD research and development and acquisition programs.  This effort will be funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-07, and from PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01.  Under this PE the study will fund concept and technology development efforts.  Systems efforts will be funded from AIR-01."

Recent research indicates that significant performance benefits could be achieved by actively morphing the shape or properties of the rotor system; additionally, active rotors with on-blade control could eliminate the need for a rotor swashplate.  Other advanced technologies are also being studied which could lead to improvements in hover and cruise efficiencies, and the elimination of large, open rotor systems all together.  MAR capability will result in dramatic improvements in system performance, operational availability, sustainability, and survivability, including reduction in acoustic susceptibility and rotor vibration while increasing useful payload fraction and range.  The MAR program will design, test, and mature active rotor technologies that enable the effective operation of military rotorcraft in performance-limited environments of high-altitude mountainous terrain and deserts.

Processing here includes a number of critical steps including conditioning of unstructured data, content analysis, behavioral modeling, pattern-of-life characterization, economic activity analysis, social network analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization.  Operational benefits include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon.

For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training\/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel\/funds transfers, etc.  Nexus 7 supports emerging military missions using both traditional and non-traditional data sources for those areas of the world and mission sets with limited conventional Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.  Examples of additional data sources include foreign news, media, and social network data.  These non-traditional sources will be integrated with a wide variety of military structured and unstructured data.  Nexus 7 will develop quantitative techniques and tools for processing and analyzing these large data sources as a means for understanding relationships between hostile, neutral, and friendly foreign organizations with the United States."

Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image in a timely fashion.  The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive distributed image stores.

This capability would increase the number of people who could effectively contribute, would make experts more productive, and would enable the creation of new tactical applications that are inconceivable given today's tools.  The key enabling technology is a new programming paradigm called probabilistic programming that facilitates the management of uncertain information.  In this approach, developers will use the power of a modern (probabilistic) programming language to quickly build a generative model of the phenomenon of interest as well as queries of interest, which a compiler will convert into an efficient application.  PPAML technologies will be designed for application to a wide range of military domains including ISR exploitation, robotic and autonomous system navigation and control, weather prediction, and medical diagnostics."

The Manned-Unmanned Collaborative Autonomy program will develop concepts and implementing software for a truly shared autonomy - human \"on-the-loop\" - in which multiple unmanned systems can perform missions with minimal guidance from, and limited cognitive interference with, a single human operator in conventional arenas, such as air or ground, as well as atypical environments such as littoral waters. Approaches to develop shared autonomy will build on past successes in a range of efforts, including pilot-on-the-loop simulations under the past DARPA Unmanned Combat Air Rotor (UCAR) and Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) efforts as well as the significant progress made in DARPA's Warfighter Under Stress program."

The EXACTO 50-caliber bullet and brass-board optical sighting technology greatly extends the day and night ranges over current state-of-the-art sniper systems allowing sniper teams to engage tactically important moving targets including accelerating vehicle-borne targets, in high crosswind conditions.  EXACTO enhances survivability by allowing greater shooter standoff range and reduces target engagement timelines."

Included in this project are efforts across a wide range of materials including: structural materials and devices, functional materials and devices, and materials that enable new propulsion concepts for land, sea, and space vehicles and low distortion optical lenses.\n\nThe Biologically Based Materials and Devices project acknowledges the growing and pervasive influence of the biological sciences on the development of new materials, devices and processes, as well as the commensurate influence of materials, physics and chemistry on new approaches to biology and biochemistry.  Contained in this project are thrusts in the application of biomimetic materials and devices for Defense, the development of biochemical materials to maintain performance, the use of biology's unique fabrication capabilities to produce structures that cannot be made any other way, and the development of manufacturing tools that use biological components and processes for material synthesis.  It also supports a major thrust that will revolutionize the development of prosthetics for the wounded soldier.\n\nThe Tactical and Strategic Energy Technology project focused on the unique challenges facing the DoD in developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and energy storage technologies.  It addressed critical military needs for improved energy efficiency and availability to support a range of military missions that include individual warfighter and small unit operations."

Improved materials require deliberate control at the scale of the relevant phenomena.  This thrust will leverage the advanced fabrication capabilities currently available, coupled with design of optical materials and component structure, to drive functional materials to high performance for soldier-centric DoD applications by design.  Novel optical materials exploiting three-dimensional degrees of freedom to increase wavefront control, and IR emissive materials are examples of materials in which design of structure at the scale of the critical phenomena can have significant impact on their performance.  To provide organic information, surveillance, and reconnaissance to the warfighter that greatly enhances awareness, security, and survivability, the capability for wearable (i.e., ultra-low size, weight, and power) systems with specific functionality will be developed.  These functions include hands-free zoom, automated brightness adjustment, threat detection, targeting assistance, change detection, and supplementary data overlay.  This thrust will also explore newly emerging areas where structure may play an important role."

The program will expand the application of gradient index optics (GRIN) by providing compact, lightweight, and cost-effective lenses with controlled dispersion and aberrations that will replace large assemblies of conventional lenses.  The ability to create entirely new optical materials and surfaces creates the potential for new or significantly improved military optical applications, such as solar concentrators, portable designators, highly efficient fiber optics, and imaging systems.  The program also seeks to extend GRIN manufacturing technologies to glass, ceramic, and other inorganic materials in order to allow for small, lightweight, customized optical elements for mid-wave and long-wave infrared (MWIR and LWIR) applications.  A key component of the program is to develop new design tools that enable optics designers to incorporate dynamic material properties, fabrication methods, and manufacturing tolerances.  The integration of new materials, design tools, and manufacturing processes will enable previously unattainable 3-D optical designs to be manufactured.  This new manufacturing paradigm will enable flexible production of GRIN optics in quantities of one unit to thousands of units."

Additional efforts expanded the spectrum of convertible feedstocks to cellulosic, algal, and other similar materials, enabling a diversified feedstock portfolio that can meet the entire DoD need within a sustainable commercial framework.  An important variant of this latter category is the development of man- and vehicle-portable technologies that produce substantial quantities of JP-8 and other useful liquid fuels from indigenously available or harvestable resources near desired locations worldwide."

Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making.  These stressors also degrade the warfighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively.  Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level.  This thrust area will utilize modern neuroscientific techniques, in conjunction with emerging solutions in neurally enabled human-machine interface technologies, to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors.  In addition, new approaches for using neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated.  This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect and improve cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment."

With its ability to perform complex chemistries, be flexibly programmed through DNA code, scale, adapt to changing environments and self-repair, biology represents one of the most powerful manufacturing platforms known.  However, the DoD's ability to harness this platform is rudimentary.  Living Foundries seeks to develop the tools, technologies, and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered.  The program will enable the rapid and scalable development of previously unattainable technologies and products (i.e., those that cannot be accessed using known, synthetic mechanisms), leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials (e.g., flouropolymers, enzymes, lubricants, coatings and materials for harsh environments), novel functions (e.g., self-repairing and self-regenerating systems), biological reporting systems, and therapeutics to enable new solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices, and capabilities in the field or on base.  Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material supply chains vulnerable to political change, targeted attack, or environmental accident.\n\nResearch thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bioproduction pipelines, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. service-oriented architecture years) design and construction of new bio-production systems for novel materials.  The result will be an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabling the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Integrated processes developed in this program will translate into significant performance improvements and cost savings for the production of advanced materials, biological reporting systems, and therapeutics.  These technologies will ultimately result in point-of-use, on-demand, customizable, and distributed production of strategic materials and systems.  Key to success will be tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation will be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of military-relevant and complex materials and functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals and polymers  (e.g., those tolerant of harsh environments), production of bio-reporting systems, or rapid and dynamic prevention, identification, and repair of corrosion\/materials degradation."

This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired.  The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training.  The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function.  This effort will be funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013."

This program led to the development of prototype digital imaging threat cueing systems capable of effective detection ranges of 1 km against dismounts, 5 km against stationary vehicles, and 10 km against moving vehicles.  Simultaneously, the system surveys a 120-degree or greater field of view, enabling the warfighter to detect, decide and act on the most advantageous timeline in complex operational environments."

Specifically, this program developed a cognitive sensor technology with limited size, weight, and power that transforms data from an imaging sensor suite into communicable knowledge for mobile, autonomous surveillance systems.  The program demonstrated an improvement of four orders of magnitude in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100MHz internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.

The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.  \n\nIn the Applied Research part of this program, high performance RF\/optoelectronic\/mixed-signal SoCs for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology.  In addition, in order to provide maximum benefit to the DoD, as these processes are developed, they will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers.  Manufacturing yield and reliability of the DAHI technologies will be characterized and enhanced.

This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.\n\nThe successful realization of a Micro PN&T device is dependent on developing fundamentally new batch microfabrication processes, gaining an understanding of the sources and effects of error at the micro-scale, and exploring new combinatorial physics.  Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques will allow co-fabrication of different materials and devices on a single chip.  Clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, calibration stages, and 3D structures could be integrated into a small, low power architecture.  This co-location of different inertial and timing devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial physics in a single micro-system, enabling fast start-up time, increased bandwidth and long-term stability, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices.  Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12."

Such X-ray sources will enable new versatile imaging modalities based on phase contrast techniques which are 1000X more sensitive than the conventional absorption contrast imaging.  Such imaging modalities should enable reverse engineering of integrated circuits to validate trustworthiness as well as battlefield imaging of soft tissues and blood vessel injuries from blunt trauma without the injection of a contrast enhancing agent.  The radiation dose required for imaging will also be reduced.\n\nThe Applied Research component of this effort will focus on applying basic research discoveries to the development of a compact, pulsed X-ray source.  Such sources are a necessary component to enable future technologies with high-speed motion imaging capabilities and the reverse engineering of integrated circuits.  This program also includes related basic research efforts funded under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01."

The MPD program will focus on development of fast, small, reliable, carrier dense, microplasma switches capable of operating in extreme conditions such as high-radiation and high-temperature environments.  Specific focus will be given to methods that produce efficient, high-pressure (up to or even beyond atmospheric pressure) generation of ions, radio frequency energy, and light sources.  Applications for such devices are far reaching, including the construction of complete high-frequency plasma-based logic circuits, and integrated circuits with superior resistance to radiation and extreme temperature environments.  It is envisaged that both two and multi-terminal devices consisting of various architectures will be developed and optimized under the scope of this program.  MPDs will be developed in various circuits and substrates to demonstrate the efficacy of different unique approaches.\n\nThe MPD applied research program is focused on transferring the fundamental scientific advances funded by PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 to produce complex circuit designs that may be integrated with commercial electronic devices.  It is expected that the MPD program will result in the design and modeling tools, as well as the fabrication capabilities necessary to commercially manufacture high-performance microscale-plasma-device-based electronic systems for advanced DoD applications."

The vision of the program is to offer the warfighter a small and versatile infrared (IR) camera that would be affordable to individual soldiers and provide multiple IR band imagery with fusion capability to take full advantage of different wavelength band phenomenology in a compact single unit.  In the future, the availability of the PIXNET camera would enable a peer-to-peer networked system for image sharing within a squad, thereby providing a better common operating picture of the battlefield and significantly enhancing the warfighter's situational understanding.  The program aims to develop a low size, weight and power (SWaP), low cost, soldier portable multiband infrared camera that will render real-time single and multiple imagery using thermal and reflective bands.  The camera will also provide fused reflective and thermal band imagery on demand.  The use of fused imagery in the PIXNET design will allow the soldier to detect camouflaged targets and distinguish targets from decoys.  The PIXNET camera will eliminate limitations posed by current capability to detect, recognize and identify targets in low light and no light nighttime operations.\n\nThe PIXNET program will focus on a significant reduction in SWaP and cost of infrared sensor components to enable portability and ability to deploy widely to all participants in the theater.  Low-cost manufacturing of wafer scale IR sensors and coolers will provide a price point that will allow these components to be deployed to each warfighter.  The emphasis on a small form-factor will naturally enable new opportunities such as surveillance with small UAVs, rifle sights with multiple bands, vehicle mounted, helmet mounted and handheld surveillance systems.  The phenomenology of different infrared wavelengths will be exploited for a target of interest and only chunks of relevant data will be fused by a smart phone android processing platform, thus reducing the data burden and ease of display.  The combination of a smart phone and PIXNET camera at the soldier level will enable more effective tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) over the current capability.  The PIXNET program takes advantage of the computing capability of smart phones to process and fuse multicolor images and send them as videos or still images to the warfighter's helmet mounted display via a wireless or wired connection.  The smart phone and PIXNET camera integration allows for a strategy to produce low cost imaging system with single band and combined band imagery.  PIXNET capability could be further exploited in the future to enable a fully networked system such as the Network Warrior integrated multiple Soldier systems capability with full spectrum image and video sharing."

A key benefit of these new devices is that they can be integrated into very compact circuits and assemblies that will provide dramatic advances to the power bus of a platform.  Specifically, this program will develop the technology to enable DC to DC power conversion for military applications at the scale of an integrated circuit so it can be embedded within the electronics subsystem and a new distributed power architecture can be realized.  The focus of this program is on attaining 100 Megahertz (MHz) internal operation frequencies of power circuits since the size of the passive elements (inductors and capacitors) in a power converter scales inversely as the fourth power of the internal operating frequency.  In FY 2012, MPC is funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-03."

The DoD relies heavily on phased arrays to maintain technological superiority in nearly every theater of conflict.  The DoD cannot update these high cost specialized arrays at the pace necessary to effectively counter adversarial threats under development using commercial-of-the-shelf components that can undergo technology refresh far more frequently.  The Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT) program will develop adaptive and standardized digital-at-every-element arrays.  The hand designed, static RF beamformers will be replaced with cost effective digital array systems capable of a yearly technology refresh.  By doing so, phased arrays will become ubiquitous throughout the DoD, proliferating onto many platforms for which phased arrays had been previously prohibitively expensive to develop or maintain.  The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01."

The sensitivity of an IR focal-plane array (FPA) is improved by cooling its detectors to cryogenic temperatures.  The disadvantages of state-of-the art Sterling cryo-coolers used for high performance IR FPAs are large size, high power and high cost.  On the other hand, thermoelectric (TE) coolers used in low performance IR cameras are relatively small, high power and it is difficult to achieve temperatures below 200 K.  \n \nTo reduce IR camera SWaP-C, innovations in cooler technology are needed.  This program will exploit the Joule-Thompson (J-T) cooling principle, in a silicon-based MEMS technology, for making IR FPA coolers with very low SWaP-C. MEMS microfluidics, piezoelectric MEMS, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics will be used to demonstrate an integrated cold head and compressor, all in a semiconductor chip.  Since a J-T cooler works by cooling from gas expansion, the coefficient of performance is expected to be much higher than state-of-the-art TE coolers and significantly smaller than Sterling coolers.  The chip-scale J-T cooler will be designed for pressure ratios of 4 or 5 to 1 with high compressor frequency in small volume.  The goal of the MC-FPA Program will be to demonstrate cooling down to 150K.  The microcoolers chip-scale size will cost less and will be significantly smaller.  Once the proof-of-principle is demonstrated, subsequent program effort would focus on transitioning to chip-scale manufacture on 8-12 inch wafers, resulting in cooler costs decreasing to as low as $50.  An extended wavelength-range short-wave IR detector will be integrated with a micro-cooler for demonstration of the MC-FPA. The basic research component of this program is budgeted under PE 0601101E, Project ES-01."

The primary technical challenges include loss of information due to quantum decoherence and the practical limitations associated with solid-state devices (operation at cryogenic temperatures, susceptibility to electronic and magnetic noise, limited coupling distance for qubit interactions, etc.).  Theoretical efforts in QIS are investigating novel techniques for preserving coherence, distributing quantum entanglement, and efficiently modeling qubit operation.  Complementary experiments are seeking to demonstrate qubits with better coherence properties than existing devices and to implement entangling operations between two or more solid-state qubits.  Future technologies utilizing quantum information science could enable ultra-secure communications; faster algorithms for optimization and simulation in logistics, war gaming, and pharmaceutical development; and new methods for image and signal processing in measurement and signature intelligence activities (MASINT)."

The program will develop and establish an initial set of materials and components along with integration and manufacturing capabilities to undergird a fundamentally new class of electronics defined by their performance and transience. These transient electronics will perform in a manner comparable to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems, but with limited device persistence that can be programmed, adjusted in real-time, triggered, and\/or sensitive to the environment.  VAPR will provide an initial capability to make transient electronics a deployable technology for the DoD and Nation.  Basic research for the VAPR program is being performed in PE 0601101E, TRS-01.\n\nTo manufacture transient systems at scale will require significant research and development into: higher levels of circuit integration and complexity to realize advanced circuit functionalities; integrated system designs to achieve required function (in modes that offer programmed or triggered transience); integration of novel materials into circuit fabrication processes; and development of new packaging strategies. The efficacy of the technological capability developed through VAPR will be demonstrated through a final test vehicle of a transient sensor system. The goal is to develop a suite of design principles, develop strategies and pathways, process flows, tools and basic components that are readily generalizable and can be leveraged towards the development of many other transient electronics devices"

The high levels of integration possible in silicon technologies enable on-chip linearization, complex waveform synthesis, and digital calibration and correction.  Military applications include ultra-miniaturized transceivers for satellite communications-on-the-move, collision avoidance radars for micro-\/nano-air vehicles, and ultra-miniature seekers for small munitions.  The technology developed under this program could also be leveraged to improve the performance of high-power amplifiers based-on other nonsilicon technologies through heterogeneous integration strategies.  Significant technical obstacles to be overcome include the development of highly efficient circuits for increasing achievable output power of silicon devices (e.g., device stacking, power combining) at mm-waves; scaling high-efficiency amplifier classes to the mm-wave regime; integrated linearization architectures for complex modulated waveforms; and robust RF\/mixed-signal isolation strategies."

Additionally, the integrated phase control provided the unprecedented ability to rapidly change the number of simultaneous beams, beam profile, and power-per-beam, thus opening a whole new direction in operational capability.  Key technical challenges included the ability to achieve the needed facet density (facet pitch should be on the order of a wavelength or two), control the relative phase across all facets equivalent to 9-bits, and efficiently couple and distribute coherent light to facets from a master laser oscillator with an integrated waveguide structure."

T3 would allow any aircraft to rapidly switch between air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities.  T3's speed, maneuverability, and network-centric capabilities would significantly improve U.S. aircraft survivability and increase the number and variety of targets that could be destroyed on each sortie.

Specific technology development areas will include: robust precision guidance, navigation and control with GPS denial, multi-modal sensors for high probability target identification in dense shipping environments, and precision aimpoint targeting for maximum lethality.  Component technologies are being developed, demonstrated, and integrated into a complete weapon system.  The program will result in a high fidelity demonstration to support military utility assessment.  LRASM is a joint DARPA\/Navy effort."

IH seeks technological advances in the areas of: next generation aero-configurations; thermal protection systems and hot structures; adaptive guidance, navigation, and control; enhanced range and data collection methods; and advanced propulsion concepts, including real-time trajectory planning.  The IH program is designed to address technical challenges and improve understanding of long-range hypersonic flight through an initial full-scale baseline test of an existing hypersonic test vehicle, followed by a series of subscale flight tests, innovative ground-based testing, expanded modeling and simulation, and advanced analytic methods, culminating in a test flight of a full-scale hypersonic demonstrator.  This program will leverage advances made by the previously funded Falcon program.  The Integrated Hypersonics (IH) program results are planned for transition to the Air Force."

The program will demonstrate the technology for launch and recovery of large, medium altitude, long-endurance aircraft capable of providing persistent 24\/7 Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike capabilities at long radius orbits.  By extending the ISR\/strike radius and simultaneously increasing time on station beyond current capabilities from smaller ships, TERN will enable novel operational concepts including responsive, persistent deep overland ISR\/strike without requirement for forward basing.  To achieve these goals, the program will create new concepts for aircraft launch and recovery, aircraft logistics and maintenance, and aircraft flight in regimes associated with maritime operating conditions.  The program will culminate in a launch and recovery demonstration.  Application of TERN technologies and operationally concepts will enable a novel and cost efficient approach for mission sets including ship identification, overland or maritime surveillance, and strike.  The anticipated transition partner is the Navy."

DARPA will conduct a study of current air dominance efforts in coordination with the United States Air Force and Navy and explore potential technology developmental areas to ensure the air superiority of the United States in the future.  The study will consider roles of manned and unmanned platforms; the relative performance of alternative integrated systems concepts that combine various mixes of capabilities networked together; and the cost effectiveness of alternative balances of platforms and systems that provide surveillance, command and control, electronic warfare, and weapons functions.  Innovative platform concepts for airframe, propulsion, sensors, weapons integration, avionics, and active and passive survivability features will be explored as a central part of the concept definition effort.  This effort will also explore the expanded development and use of automated and advanced aerospace engineering design tools, modeling, and simulation in areas that can increase the likelihood of producing more capable products with improved efficiency.  Following the initial multi-agency study, DARPA will present technical challenges to industry to allow them to explore and present potential solutions.  Enabling technologies are next generation platforms, advanced networking capabilities, reliable navigation, passive and active defense, electronic attack, area denial, advanced sensors, and cyber technologies.  After the study, it is envisioned that high potential prototype programs will emerge to develop technologies for future air dominance.  Early planning for future technologies will also help to define the funding baselines for DOD research and development and acquisition programs.   This effort is funded from PE 0602702E, Project TT-07, and from PE 0603286E, Project AIR-01."

ISIS is achieving radical sensor improvements by melding the next-generation technologies for enormous lightweight antenna apertures and high-energy density components into a highly integrated lightweight multi-purpose airship structure - completely erasing the distinction between payload and platform.  The ISIS concept includes ninety-nine percent on-station 24\/7\/365 availability for simultaneous Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI) (600 kilometers) and Ground-Based Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) (300 kilometers) operation; ten years of autonomous, unmanned flight; hundreds of wideband in-theater concealed communications links; responsive reconstitution of capabilities lost by any failed space assets; plus CONUS-based sensor analysis and operation.  The ISIS technologies will be made available to the Air Force and other Services."

Vulture technology enables a re-taskable, persistent pseudo-satellite capability, in a notional aircraft package.  The technology challenges include structural integrity of very lightly-loaded airframe structure, efficient and reliable energy collection, storage\/retrieval and management, and reliability technologies capable of allowing the aircraft to operate continuously for five years.  The remaining Vulture program will conduct subscale demonstration activities to prove out critical technologies.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Navy."

The program used two NASA RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft as surrogate platforms to inform the development of next generation HALE aircraft built around aerial refueling, which has proven vital to manned military aviation.  Specific challenges included precise control of limited flight performance aircraft under high-altitude conditions, redundant safe separation, and complex unmanned flight operations.  The program also promoted the application of autonomy for better effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in challenging environments.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and Navy."

The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems, replenishment supplies to orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems."

The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential threats, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of defensive systems, replenishment supplies to orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion\/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems."

While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances architectural and programmatic adaptability and robustness - reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, enabling incremental deployment of the system, and enhancing survivability.  The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures.\n\nThe System F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package (F6TP) a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level.  Multiple versions of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs termed the F6 Developer's Kit (FDK).  The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party mission partner.  Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on-orbit infrastructure will also remain following the demonstration, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for a perpetual on-orbit resource capability.  The utility of the F6 architecture in low earth orbit (LEO) is significantly enabled by persistent broadband connectivity to the ground which allows resource sharing between space-based modules and terrestrial network nodes.  A solution to enable high-availability, low-latency, persistent, high-bandwidth communication with LEO spacecraft will be developed in the course of the F6 program.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force, though the architecture will have the ability to simultaneously accommodate payloads from multiple other partners including the Army and Navy.  The resultant architecture is expected to significantly lower the barrier to entry and enhance competiveness of the national security space industrial base."

ALASA seeks improvements in cost, responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience with a single approach.  ALASA will enable small satellites to be deployed to orbit from an airborne platform, allowing performance improvement, reducing range costs, and flying more frequently, which drives cost per pound down.  The ability to relocate and launch from virtually any major runway around the globe reduces the time needed to deploy a satellite system.  Launch point offset permits essentially any possible orbit direction to be achieved without concerns for launch direction imposed by geography.  Finally, launch point offset allows the entire operation to be moved should a particular fixed airfield become unavailable due to natural phenomena or other issues.  Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, control of weight and margin under a hard gross weight limit, and achieving a cost per flight of $1 million, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of 100 lb.

Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located.  Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra-high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning.\n\nSDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data collection and data processing\/ fusion to provide automated data synergy.  The resulting increase in space domain awareness will enhance overall space safety of flight, and allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions.  The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in non-traditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain.  SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses.  Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity.\n\nEfficient collection of data for SDA is crucial to controlling costs.  SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from non-traditional sources, such as amateur includes orbit outlook astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques.  The Galileo effort will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground.  Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform.  The concept is similar to existing astronomic interferometers, except Galileo will extend the basic interferometric technology to utilize fiber optic transport of light between each telescope to match the optical path length instead of the traditional evacuated light tubes.  Technical challenges include: controlling thermal effects and dispersion within the fiber to properly interfere the light from the two telescopes, precisely measuring the distance between the fixed and mobile telescope systems, and accurately measuring relative phase from low signal flux levels with low mutual coherence.  The potential transition customer is the Air Force."

A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance.  This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions.  The program is also investigating expanding the demonstration of the telescope to explore detection and tracking of broader classes of space objects under different orbital regimes, and the impact of observations from different environments.  The Air Force Space Command is the intended transition partner.\n\n In addition, the program is investigating data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects.  SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects.  Furthermore, the data fusion effort is investigating methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide knowledge about UCTs.  Specifically, the data fusion effort is investigating methods to quickly provide positive identification of orbital objects, rapidly characterize them and maintain a catalog of determined characteristics, and dynamically schedule available sensors to provide the most valuable and timely observations possible.  Where appropriate, SST will investigate new concepts which would provide complementary or further advances in ground-based deep space object detection and characterization.\n\nThe SST Australia effort will provide a further operational demonstration of the SST at an Australian site.  Such a location presents a more operationally relevant demonstration, with a richer and more interesting population of SSA targets in geosynchronous orbit.  A demonstration in Australia would investigate telescope performance and observe objects and orbits not visible from the current site in New Mexico.  In addition, the demonstration would generate data for analysis and fusion efforts, which will be used to further refine and evaluate data processing techniques, such as those developed under the Ibex effort.

A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at Geosynchronous (GEO) altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft.  Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems have been previously pursued.  The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment and going beyond pure traditional servicing functions.  The program seeks to repurpose high value long life components on existing satellites in GEO, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners, utilizing commercial ride-along capability to send newly developed small, modular, and inexpensive \"satlet\" satellite modules into GEO for use in upgrading, fixing, repairing, and enhancing the repurposed components.  Key challenges include transportation and orbital maneuvering, robotic systems and integration, and extravehicular tool requirements.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force."

The goal of the SeeMe program is to demonstrate the ability to get near-real-time, i.e., no older than ~90 minutes, images directly to individual users' handheld devices from space.  This will be accomplished via a very low cost constellation of inexpensive, disposable small satellites routinely and inexpensively put in orbit through low cost horizontal (aircraft-released) launches.  The current methodology for satisfying imagery needs from space is to build multipurpose systems with very high reliability and long life, at very high costs, and launch them on expensive vertical launch boosters. In most cases, commercial or military, the time to deliver an already built space intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system suitable to meet tactically desired ground sample distance is on the order of 20+ months, and the data delivery mechanism is typically more than several days (and up to weeks) to the end user.  SeeMe intends to radically shorten the entire cycle: ground development time, launch cadence, and on-orbit request-to-image-delivery time through new satellite manufacturing techniques, advanced low-cost aperture technologies, leveraging alternative launch concepts, and a novel direct-to-user command and data exfiltration architecture.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and the Army."

Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments.  MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges.\n\nThe goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems.  These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost."

Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems.  The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements.  These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments.  The microfluidic molecular systems effort will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules for tailored sequence analysis to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states.  Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices.  Another focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations.\n\nThe major technical focus areas of the MEMS and Integrated Microsystems programs contained in this project are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; 7) thermal management; and 8) navigation and positioning technologies."

This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities.  The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations.  The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction.  Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers.  The Micro PN&T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Navigation Grade Integrated Micromachined Gyroscopes, Micro Inertial Navigation Technology, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Micromachined Rate Integrating Gyroscopes, Single-Chip Timing and Inertial Measurement Unit, Primary and Secondary Calibration on Active Layer, and Chip-Scale Combinatorial Atomic Navigator.  The technology is expected to transition through industry and existing DoD transition partnerships with the Services.\n\nTo achieve the low SWaP necessary for guided munitions, UAVs, and personal navigation applications, the technologies in the MicroPN&T program will have to push the limitations of integration and performance in current MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technologies.  Unprecedented levels of precision will be required to meet the stringent demands of the military environment.  New architectures for devices will be developed that will leverage advances in fabrication techniques in order to increase stability and performance of a MEMS structure.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

The overall goal of the program was to insert breakthrough materials and structures at all layers of DoD systems, and enable higher power densities, increased performance, and improved efficiency.  Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, were developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems.  Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and\/or redesigning the complementary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance was another thrust of this program.  Another element of this effort focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.  Technology will be inserted through DoD industrial firms into future DoD systems."

These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms.  At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave\/microwave.  Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module.  The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system.  This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'.\n\nThe field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer\/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date.  Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication.  This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies.  This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures.  Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon.  The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer\/nanometer scale.  The program includes the development of micrometer\/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf\/mmwave\/microwave technologies.  For example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment.  The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability."

Availability of very low cost and small form-factor infrared (IR) cameras will facilitate new techniques and applications that could provide the decisive edge needed in modern battlefields.  These cameras will allow a soldier to have practical thermal imaging capability for locating warm objects (e.g., enemy combatants) in darkness.  The small size, weight and power (SWaP) thermal camera will be integrated with a handheld device such as a cell phone with network capability for tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  In order to achieve this goal, breakthroughs will be required in low-cost thermal imagers manufactured using wafer scale integration, vacuum packaging, low cost optics and low-power signal processing.  By the end of the program, the imager chips will be fully integrated with a low-cost processor and optics.  The camera will have wireless connectivity to integrate video display with cell phones or PDAs.  U.S. Army PEO Soldier Sensors and Lasers (SSL), PM Optics USMC, USSOCOM and industry will be the transition partners."

These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities.  Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking.  With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts (kW) per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight.  In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture.  Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array.  Excalibur will provide the technology foundation for defense of next generation airborne platforms, including all aircraft flying at altitudes below 50,000 ft, against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and more capable air-to-air missiles converted for use as ground-to-air missiles.  Excalibur will enable these platforms to fly at lower altitude and conduct truly persistent, all-weather ground missions, such as reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover.  Further capabilities may include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications.\n\nThe Excalibur program will also develop efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining.  The potential of these arrays to scale to tactical power levels (100 kilowatt class) will be investigated.  These laser amplifier arrays will be designed to work in tandem with the core laser components developed under the Excalibur program in PE 0602702E, Project TT-06.  In addition a conceptual design and CONOPS development for a High Energy Laser Counter Measure (HELCM) system will be developed to enable a near-term capability for low-altitude self-defense against MANPADS.  This technology will transition via industry."

Specifically, one such program was the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) could be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity\/density, respectively).  The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium Nitride, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductors), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures.  This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoC) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications.\n\nThis program has complementary research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01, and in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01.  The Advanced Technology Development part of this program will leverage the 6.1 and 6.2 programs with focus on the establishment of an accessible, manufacturable technology for device-level heterogeneous integration of a wide array of materials and devices (including, for example, multiple electronics and MEMS technologies) with complex silicon-enabled (e.g. CMOS) architectures on a common silicon substrate platform.  This part of the program is expected to culminate in accessible foundry processes of DAHI technology and demonstrations of advanced microsystems with innovative architectures and designs that leverage heterogeneous integration.  By the end of the program, this effort seeks to establish a technologically mature, sustainable DAHI foundry service to be made available (with appropriate computer-aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers."

This will give the commander insight into the disposition of enemy and friendly forces, a joint situational awareness picture that will improve planning, decision-making and execution support capability and provide secure multimedia information interfaces and assured software to \"on the move\" users.  Integration of collection management, planning and battlefield awareness programs is an essential element for achieving battlefield dominance through assured information systems.\n\nThe goals of the Information Integration Systems project are to take diverse data inputs from a variety of sources, efficiently disseminate the information, and perform distributed and dynamic all-source correlation and fusion to produce an integrated, geo-spatially referenced, battlefield database and knowledge-base.  The principal element of this project is assured communications using standard and non-traditional means, on and off the battlefield.\n\nThe goals of the Secure Information and Network Systems project are to develop and test emerging computer and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based.  Computer and network security technologies arising from other projects will be further identified, developed, integrated, and tested."

Specific technologies developed under RC2 included advanced analysis, visualization, and planning tools that provided Commanders and their staffs with a dashboard to enhance situation awareness of the C2 architectures and understand the mission impact of outages.  The RC2 tools and technologies enabled operators to detect anomalous behavior via intuitive information displays; assess business function impact, including second- and third-order effects; and re-plan how the system can be used to achieve organizational goals and priorities.

The goal of the Information Integration Systems project is to develop and demonstrate technologies that will provide effective communications to U.S. forces.  Approaches to this goal include developing technologies that increase network capacity and scaling, enhance spectrum efficiency in congested spectrum, tolerate network degradation, provide man-made and natural electromagnetic interference mitigation, defeat network reconnaissance and surveillance, counter denial of service and other threats, and autonomously move relevant information from the cloud to the edge."

The program will develop models of adversary, commercial, and friendly cognitive radios and implement those models in a reasoner that assesses, in real time, the current and future dynamics of the communications network.  Core technologies for operation in highly dynamic and\/or high jamming to signal environments will be developed to include: automated jamming waveform forensics; local environment assessment (time, space, frequency, polarization); technologies for addressing known attack strategies and interference properties; and antenna, signal processing, modulation, and network optimization technologies.  Based on predictions of the level of communication success compared to mission communication requirements, the reasoner within the cognitive radio will choose waveform selections\/configurations that best achieve mission objectives.  The reasoner will include the capability to analyze and select optimum frequency, waveform, and network configurations during all aspects of a mission.  The design effort will lead to new radio communication architectures, more robust radio communication networking, and better understanding of selection amongst interference avoidance and interference suppression strategies.  This program also seeks to enable communication between dispersed and distributed emitters and receivers to provide a multiplier in capacity for both locating emitters and assessing effectiveness of an electronic attack.  The CommEx technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy."

The Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program seeks new ways to protect our signals from exploitation by increasingly sophisticated adversaries and to do so in a way that can be maintained as commercial technology advances.  Three different techniques are being developed: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal.  The objective of the program is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (<$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - supercomputer-level processing power.  Another track of the program will extend the CLASS technology to provide Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) communications.  These techniques will reduce the detectability of communications signals by a factor of 1,000x beyond current capabilities.  Scalable performance will allow LPI techniques to better trade information rate for communications capacity.  Technologies from this program are planned to transfer to the U.S. Army (for ground system applications) and to USAF (for airborne applications)."

Advances in communications technologies are enabling high-capacity communications to the edge.  However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents reliability and capacity challenges with distributing relevant information to users at the edge.  Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly-reliable fixed networking infrastructure with embedded complex information exploitation tools.  The commercial system is enabled by infrastructure (e.g. fiber optic networks) that is not available to the warfighter at the edge.  This program will leverage commercial technologies to develop, prototype, and demonstrate the networking technologies and information dissemination techniques needed to enable efficient and robust content distribution using dynamic, mobile, ad hoc military networks.  CBMEN will be installed and demonstrated on existing radios.  Capabilities from this effort will transition to the DoD."

Mobile Hotspots will develop an airborne high capacity data distribution network to interconnect groups of tactical users in a manner that is conceptually similar to the commercial tiered approach interconnecting cell towers and wireless hotspots.  Mobile Hotspots will exploit advances in millimeter-wave technology and airborne networking to develop a self-organizing, 1 Gbps mobility backbone formed from highly-directional communications links to interconnect mounted and dismounted warfighters, dispersed tactical operations centers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.  Low size, weight and power designs will be integrated with commercial and military communications equipment and mounted on tactical UAVs and ground vehicles to provide network access to mobile users via infrastructureless hotspots that are compatible with existing radios.  The Mobile Hotspots program is targeted to transition to the Army and Marine Corps Expeditionary Forces."

Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable.  Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will overcome these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of megabits per second) data links from within a protected space.  The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to\/from tactical wireless networks.  Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays.  When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will extend the reach of tactical communication systems by 10X without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure."

Current approaches are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time-based processing for each emitter.  As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of collection assets and the required level of signal processing inhibits our capability to pervasively sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action.  To address these and other shortfalls, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing and manipulating the RF environment based on distributed rather than centralized collection.  This approach will take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices, such as radios and cell phones, on the battlefield.  To leverage these existing devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between devices.  It will also develop approaches to exploit our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of RF devices to provide reliable and assured communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks.  Building upon technologies investigated within other programs in this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments.  Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services."

The technology development culminated in the demonstration of a large-sized coherent, active electronically-steerable array (AESA) with an output power density of 5W per square cm and a total layer thickness of less than 1cm.  The SMART technology approach resulted in a breakthrough in performance over conventional millimeter-wave approaches.  The 3-D multi-layer assemblies developed will greatly reduce AESA packaging complexity and enable very compact, low-cost, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency circuit \"building blocks\" to combine to form arbitrarily large arrays.  New capabilities, such as the ability to construct reconfigurable and\/or multi-band AESAs and other MMW circuits, will be enabled by this architectural approach.\n\nThe SMART program is transitioning through industrial producers of MMW radar and communication system components for DoD applications.  Additional funding in FY 2013 and FY 2014 is budgeted to facilitate this transitional work to move beyond laboratory demonstrations to a manufacturing environment consistent with high yield, volume capability, and advanced readiness levels while maintaining performance.  An additional goal is to demonstrate the ability to adapt to system-level requirements as obtained from applications such as air-to-air and satellite communications at MMW frequencies, such as serial addressable arrays and large aperture assembly."

DARPA's hybrid Free Space Optical Experimental Network Experiment (FOENEX) system has broken the 10 Gb\/s wireless network boundary using free-space optical links, but all-weather Ku band components are currently limited to much less than 1Gb\/s capacity.  Furthermore, the hybrid optical\/RF system exhibits size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) characteristics that preclude deployment on many SWaP-limited platforms.  Moving to a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution will provide high capacity as well as all-weather resiliency, yet presents technical challenges that include the generation of higher-order waveforms (beyond common data link), efficient power transmission, high-speed routing, and low-noise receivers.  This program will develop the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gbps backbone at half the size, weight and power consumption of the current FOENEX system.  The 100 Gbps RF Backbone program is intended for transition to multiple Services."

The DoD will need more data\/sensor capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology to operate with less spectrum.  The objective of this program is to investigate improvements in spectral reuse (spectrum sharing of sensor\/radar bands).  The program will leverage technical trends in cooperative sharing to exploit radar anti-jam and interference mitigation technologies that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach will include exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems, and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal is to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity. Technology from this program will be made available to the DoD."

Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for break-ins and abnormal behavior without context.  The CINDER program will build tools and techniques that apply mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity.  The program focuses on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware.  Through this CINDER will uncover ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage within our cyber environments.  Capabilities from this program will transition to DoD and the defense industrial base."

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are:  (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  \n\nThe Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic\/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical\/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations."

The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems.  HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision\/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions.  Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored.  With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air, ground, or sea-based tactical vehicles.  While the prototype laser weapon system module is in design and development, the HELLADS 150 kilowatt (kW) laser will be made available for demonstration opportunities and transition to the Army and Navy."

In current operations, soldiers carry upwards of 50lbs of equipment, in some cases over 100lbs, over long distances in terrain not always accessible by wheeled platforms that support infantry.  As a result, the soldier's combat effectiveness can be compromised.  The LS3 program will design and develop prototypes capable of carrying 400lbs of payload for 20 miles in 24 hours, negotiating terrain at endurance levels expected of typical squad maneuvers.  LS3 will leverage technical breakthroughs of prior biologically inspired legged platform development efforts.  It will develop system designs to the scale and performance adequate for infantry squad mission applications, focusing on platform, control, and human-machine interaction capabilities, as well as secondary design considerations, such as acoustic signature.  Anticipated service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces."

Many current prototypes are inspired by biological systems and while proof-of-principle systems have or are demonstrating unprecedented mobility, limitations have emerged.  Advanced capabilities in perception, control, and physical capability\/coordination are needed to work autonomously in human environments.  These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access\/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range\/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel.\n\nThe Robotics Challenge program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency.  Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build \"machine trust\", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments.  The Robotics Challenge program consists of a series of obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot capabilities for disaster response.  Robotics Challenge events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power.  Program objectives focus on technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective design, validation, and construction of autonomous technology, and human-robot interaction.  The 6.2 portion of this program is budgeted in PE 0602702E project TT-04.  Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces."

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality.  The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems.  Deep ocean sonar nodes will operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead.  Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite.  The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas.  For the vast shallow continental shelf areas, the program similarly adopts distributed mobile sensors, but instead leverages insights in non-acoustic sensing from above.  The effort is highly focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size, to enable UAV implementations.  Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights.  From this work, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration.  The program will achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms.  This program will transition to the Navy."

This program will demonstrate the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms.  As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments.  Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping.  In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury.  Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity.  By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment.  Technology from this program will transition to the Navy."

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.  \n\nThe Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission.  The project is primarily driven by four needs:  1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.\n\nThe Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets.  In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis."

The ANS approach relies on two major technology innovations.  The first is the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources.  These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and will use specially tailored algorithms to determine position.  The second technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment.  While component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing is advancing rapidly (in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors), real-time integration and reconfiguration of these components is not possible given today's navigation filters and centralized processing architectures, which are inherently fragile to change.  Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures could enable \"plug-and-play\" integration of both existing and future navigation components to allow real-time integration and reconfiguration of navigation systems.  If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized.  Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments."

Military sensors are currently developed as unique designs that fully integrate mission specific hardware required for sensing, with all of the other non-mission specific capabilities, including supporting sensors (GPS), processing, memory storage and communications into a single device.  Not only does this approach significantly increase the cost of the device, it makes changing requirements and the upgrading of any specific component extremely difficult.  Commercial processes, such as those used in the smart phone industry, create reference designs for common system functions and features to accelerate system development time, and make it easier to change requirements and upgrade capability.  Adopting commercial processes makes it possible to create a mission-independent, designed-to-cost \"commercial smart core\" that can be combined with an appliqu\u00e9 of mission-specific hardware to provide the overall sensor system.  The core can be upgraded independently of any particular sensor; sensors can make use of the advances and decreasing cost that is inherent in commercial technology.  Commercial technology can be used in the core and commercial development and manufacturing techniques can also be leveraged to further improve the cost and development time of sensor systems.  In addition, this program will enable effective distributed sensor systems that were previously infeasible due to high cost of individual sensors.  The Smart Munitions effort will use ADAPT's sensing, processing, communications, and location capabilities to provide positive identification and man-in-the-loop control of distributed unattended ground sensor systems.  The Smart Munitions effort will develop a reference design used to demonstrate capability and develop tactics for unattended sensors.  This program will transition to the Services."

This program leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near\/mid\/long-wave infrared bands to enable the development of a multi-function optical system.  Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets.  The Multi-Function Optical Sensor program will result in an airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges.

Radar signals were used to image static structures directly.  Doppler processing of radar signals was also exploited to find, identify, and perform feature-aided tracking of moving personnel within a building and allow mapping of building pathways and stairways by monitoring traffic through buildings.  Multipath and propagation effects were modeled and iteratively compared with hypotheses of building structures to provide 3-D building maps and large concentrations of metal materials like weapons.

Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments."

This will change the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach.  When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat.  An optimization process will tailor near-real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources.  Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness.  The program is planned for transition to the Services."

Current airborne electronic warfare (EW) systems rely on the ability to uniquely identify a threat radar system to apply an appropriate preprogrammed countermeasure (CM) technique which can take many months to develop.  Countering radar systems is increasingly challenging as digitally programmed radars exhibit novel behaviors and agile waveform characteristics.  ARC will develop new processing techniques and algorithms that adapt in real-time to generate suitable countermeasures.  Using techniques such as state modeling, machine learning, and system probing, ARC will learn the behavior of the threat system, then choose and implement an appropriate countermeasure strategy.  ARC technologies will transition to the U.S. Air Force and Navy."

The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools.  Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration.  MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts.  MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.

Beyond landing aids in DVE, RF-based sensors can also be used for additional situational awareness, such as near ground obstacle avoidance, air-to-air collision avoidance, targeting\/fire control, as well as many other combat support activities.  Building on advancements made with RF sensors under this program, the program will further seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently-developed systems for landing in DVEs, terrain avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and targeting\/fire control.  This will reduce the overall weight, power usage, cost, and profusion of subsystems and exterior antennas on military aircraft, thus enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden.

Under clear conditions, targets are easily-identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere is not always clear, and inhibits traditional optical sensors.  The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and this negates optical targeting sensors.  Similarly, rotary\/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that block circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces.  The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function.  Technology from this program is planned to transition to AFSOC."

Significant challenges have arisen as the result of two warfighting trends.  First, the ever-changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs.  Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment.  In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program has developed enhanced optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies for airborne optical sensing systems.  Specific examples of these technologies include: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; advanced laser radar technologies; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection and underwater object detection; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; and adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators.  The program has extended these technologies and is making them practical for airborne surveillance systems. The remaining effort in this program is the HALOE (High Altitude Lidar Operations Experiment) program which has demonstrated, in an operational environment, the full capability of a 3-D imaging system.  The HALOE system provides support for current and emerging warfighter needs by delivering high-resolution, wide-area 3-D lidar imagery data in the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) environment.  This system provides the unprecedented capability to collect accurate, high resolution 3-D data over wide areas to support a wide range of high-value applications, including detailed mission planning, vertical obstruction detection, helicopter landing zone analysis, and imagery geolocation.  The pathway to accomplish this goal includes improving the robustness and reliability of the sensor, conducting demonstrations, and training with CONUS flight tests leading to OCONUS operational experimentation in partnership with the Army.\n\nHALOE successfully completed the CONUS flight testing phase and was deployed OCONUS for further testing and system checkout to address current and emerging needs of U.S. forces under the direction of commanders in theater during 2011.  The completed HALOE system will transition to the U.S. Army."

The nighttime persistent capability provided by ARGUS-IR combined with the daytime capability provided by the ARGUS Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) enables 24-hour day\/night surveillance.  ARGUS-IR's wide-area, high-update-rate, high-resolution imaging capability enables detection and tracking of dismounts as well as vehicles.  ARGUS-IR utilizes the signal\/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined on a common platform.  ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges related to the IR FPA and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor.  A transition plan is being developed with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army."

Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animals, and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and (d) maritime and littoral environments where threats now include terrorists, pirates, smugglers, drug traffickers, and other non-traditional adversaries.  The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions."

The technical approach emphasizes model-based correlation, adversary behavior modeling, threat network analysis tools, resource management tools, a unified data management and processing environment, novel exploitation algorithms and analysis methodologies, and tools to integrate human and machine processing, including visualization, hypothesis manipulation, on-line learning, and distributed social intelligence.  Insight development activities leverage both virtual and physical test bed environments.  The virtual test bed enables evaluation of alternative sensor mixes and algorithms under extended operating conditions.  The physical test bed enables live testing under realistic operational conditions using current and next generation sensing and processing systems.  Insight technology development is being coordinated with the following potential transition sponsors: Army Program Executive Office-Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors, Distributed Common Ground System - Army, Army Intelligence and Security Command, Air Force - Distributed Common Ground Station, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  Insight provides a unified architecture for plug-and-play ISR with extensibility to all Services and Combatant Commands, initially USCENTCOM, USSOCOM, and USPACOM."

The U.S. military has limited capability to obtain airborne ISR observations of many critical problem areas, and overhead observations are limited by sensor resolution, collection timeline, and platform geometry.  However, millions of videos posted worldwide reflect events and areas of interest for national security, and the number is rapidly increasing.  WISR will use ground-level video and still images to produce 3-D and 4-D reconstructions of events and use these reconstructions to code descriptions of dynamic content, rather than focusing on the identification and movement of individual objects and humans in the scene.  WISR constructs will be suitable for describing and differentiating patterns-of-life to reflect local and societal changes. The program will use this data in support of three missions: intelligence preparation for expeditionary forces entering a new area of operation, reconstruction of significant events worldwide, and battle damage assessment. These techniques will transition to operational commands and the intelligence community."

Scalable stochastic modeling and inference techniques yielded improved situation awareness and assessment for wide-area electro-optical\/IR motion imaging, radar, and multi-sensor exploitation applications in settings where large numbers of interacting entities engaged in complex activities are observed over long periods of time.  The techniques are intended for use in riverine and maritime environments, where extremist and criminal groups threaten political stability, trade routes, and free commerce, map navigable tributary systems, detect and identify threats, and monitor their activity.

Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that make situation assessment manpower and radar resource intensive.  This program addressed these issues by (1) developing algorithms that exploit Doppler signature data to classify detections as dismounts, animals, clutter, or vehicles; and (2) developing group tracking software that automatically tracks groups of dismounts and provides an accurate group size (\"raid count\") to users.  The Doppler discriminator and group tracking software were integrated into a stand-alone exploitation system which provides a significantly improved capability for finding and localizing targets under foliage, as well as providing automatic raid count and human\/vehicle\/animal\/clutter classification.

The move to a new facility was in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's prior leased facility did not meet the UFC standards and the lease extended beyond October 2009.  This Program Element funded all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs included design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities that led up to the move.  Further, it funded outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in May 2012."

The move to a new facility was in response to the Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Anti-terrorism\/Force Protection Requirements Regulation (UFC 4-010-01 dtd 8 Oct 2003, as amended 22 Jan 2007).  The regulation is mandatory for facilities leased for DoD use and applies to all new leases executed on or after 1 Oct 2005 and to renewal or extension of any existing lease on or after 1 Oct 2009.  DARPA's prior leased facility did not meet the UFC standards and the lease extended beyond October 2009.  This Program Element funded all expenses associated with planning and movement of the Agency to its new location.  Initial costs included design and trade studies, costs associated with implementing force protection standards, floor plan layout and planning activities that led up to the move.  Further, it funded outfitting of the selected property with the force protection standards, infrastructure, equipment, and furniture required for the DARPA staff and completion of the move in May 2012."

The range is designed to replicate complex, heterogeneous networks.  It will revolutionize cyber testing to enable efficient cyber experimentation and facilitate realistic testing of tools and techniques to enable high fidelity assessments of cyber tools and techniques and the rapid transition of research programs to operations.

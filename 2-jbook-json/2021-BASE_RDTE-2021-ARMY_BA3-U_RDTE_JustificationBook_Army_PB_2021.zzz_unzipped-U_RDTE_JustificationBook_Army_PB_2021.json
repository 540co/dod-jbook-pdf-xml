Aerial delivery is a key capability for rapid force projection and global precision delivery. These efforts are designed to advance state of the art precision delivery technologies such as parachutes, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) components and subsystems, tracking sensors, software algorithms, and safety rigging which integrate with currently equipped aircraft, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and advanced rotary wing aircraft. These efforts provide the Warfighter with highly accurate, timely cargo\/payload delivery and resupply in all terrain and weather conditions. Precision delivery\/resupply reduces vulnerability of ground Soldiers, aircraft, and aircrew. Precision aerial delivery supports remote warfare with activities such as placement of battlefield sensors, reduction of Soldier load, and initial delivery of key expeditionary base camp assets. Demonstrated technologies transition to Product Manager (PM) Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), PM-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM SCIE) as well as other Army PMs.\n\nWork in this Project is fully coordinated with PE 0602786A (Warfighter Technology) and supports Anti-Access\/Area Denial (A2\/AD) and manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) operational concepts by demonstrating precision aerial delivery and airdrop from non-traditional platforms.\n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

Tri-Service coordination and cooperative efforts are focused in four principal medical areas: Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, Militarily Relevant Infectious Diseases, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine.  Starting in Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), the principal area of Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine is replaced with the area of Medical Assist Support Technologies.\n\nPromising medical technologies are refined and validated through extensive testing, which is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for human medical products, and environmental protection agency (EPA) regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides). The FDA requires medical products to undergo extensive preclinical testing in animals and\/or other models to obtain preliminary effectiveness and safety information before they can be tested in human clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small group human study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. Each successive phase includes larger numbers of human subjects and requires FDA cognizance prior to proceeding. Work conducted in this PE primarily focuses on late stages of technology maturation activities required to conduct safety and effectiveness clinical trials. Some high-risk technologies may require additional maturation with FDA guidance prior to initiating these clinical trials. Such things as proof of product stability and purity are necessary to meet FDA standards before entering later stages of testing and prior to transitioning into a formal acquisition program where large pivotal trials in diverse populations will be conducted for licensure. Activities in this PE may include completion of preclinical animal studies and small safety and effectiveness studies involving humans according to FDA and EPA requirements. Promising medical technologies that are not regulated by the FDA or EPA are modeled, prototyped, and tested in relevant environments.\n\nBlast research and research into maturing field rations in this PE are fully coordinated with the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center. This coordination enables improved body armor design and rations for Soldiers. Additionally, the activities funded in this PE are externally peer reviewed and fully coordinated with all Services as well as other agencies through the Joint Technology Coordinating Groups of the Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management (ASBREM) Community of Interest (COI). The ASBREM COI, formed under the authority of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, serves to facilitate coordination and prevent unnecessary duplication of effort within the Department of Defense's biomedical research and development community, as well as its associated enabling research areas.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this PE is performed by: the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD."

The focus of the Project is on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that can adversely impact military mobilization, deployment, and operational effectiveness. Prior to licensure of a new drug or vaccine to treat or prevent disease, the FDA requires testing in human subjects. Studies are conducted stepwise: first to prove the product is safe in humans, second to demonstrate the desired effectiveness and optimal dosage (amount to be administered) in a small study, and third to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human populations. All test results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This Project supports the studies for safety and effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to the next phase of development for completion of expanded safety and initial studies for effectiveness in larger populations. If success is achieved for a product in this Project, the effort will transition into Advanced Development. The Project also supports testing of personal protective measures that can reduce disease transmission from arthropods to include products such as repellents and insecticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nResearch conducted in this Project focuses on the following four areas:\n\n(1)\tPrevention\/Treatment of Parasitic (organism living in or on another organism) Diseases\n(2)\tBacterial Disease Threats (diseases caused by bacteria)\n(3)\tViral Disease Threats (diseases caused by viruses)\n(4)\tDiagnostic Systems and Vector Identification and Control\n\nResearch is conducted in compliance with FDA regulations for medical products for human use and EPA regulations for insect-control products that impact humans or the environment (e.g., repellents and insecticides).\n\nWork is managed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems - Adv Dev), Project 808 (DoD Drug & Vacc Ad).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) Science and Technology (S&T) focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by USAMRDC at Fort Detrick, MD."

This effort selects candidate vaccines for various types of malaria, including the severe form of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and the less severe but relapsing form (Plasmodium vivax), prepares technical data packages required for FDA approval of testing in humans, and conducts testing of promising malaria vaccine candidates in humans.

The candidate drug may also be effective for the treatment of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. Infectious disease prevention sustains individual and unit readiness and reduces health services requirements and cost. Research is conducted in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations for medical products for human use.\n\nWork is managed by the United States (U.S.) Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC). The Army is responsible for programming and funding all Department of Defense (DoD) naturally occurring infectious disease research requirements, thereby precluding duplication of effort within the Military Departments.\n\nPromising medical countermeasures identified in this Project are further matured under PE 0603807A (Medical Systems Advanced Development), Project 808 (DoD Drug & Vacc Ad).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) science and technology focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. All FY20 adjustments align program resources to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by: the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC), Fort Detrick, MD.\n\nEfforts in this Project support the Soldier portfolio and the principal area of Military Relevant Infectious Diseases."

The major effort under this Project is the phased approach for mobile high power solid state laser (SSL) technology demonstrations that are traceable to the form, fit, and function requirements for a HEL weapon. SSL technology has demonstrated the potential to engage and defeat rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cruise missiles, sensors, and optics at tactically relevant ranges. HELs are expected to complement conventional offensive and defensive weapons at a lower cost-per-shot than current systems and without the need to strategically, operationally, or tactically stockpile ordnance. This effort utilizes a modular building block approach with open systems architecture to ensure growth, interoperability, and opportunity for technology insertions for maturation of laser, beam control, sensor\/radar, integration of power and thermal management subsystems, as well as Battle Management Command, Control, and Computers (BMC3). \n \nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY20 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities.\n\nWork is performed by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command\/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC\/ARSTRAT)."

This Project also advances open system architectures (power and data) for military ground vehicles to enable common interfaces, standards and hardware implementations. The overall vehicle system architecture is known as the Vehicle Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance \/ Electronic Warfare (C4ISR\/EW) Interoperability (VICTORY), which is a long term technology effort that provides an open architecture that will allow platforms to accept future technologies without the need for significant re design as new technologies are developed and integrated. Additionally this Project matures autonomy architectures that enable the ease of integration of autonomous subsystem technologies into future and existing tactical and combat vehicle architectures. Technical challenges include: software and algorithm development for increased levels of automation for both manned and unmanned systems, secure vehicle data networks, interoperability of intra vehicle systems, and implementation of advanced user interfaces.\nOvercoming these technical challenges enables improved and increased span of collaborative vehicle operations, efficient workload management, commander's decision aids, embedded simulation for battlefield visualization and fully integrated virtual test\/evaluation.\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver portfolio.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. FY 2020 realignments are due to financial restructuring in support of Army Modernization Priorities."

Mature technologies are incorporated onto existing, Army owned UGV technology demonstrators so that performance of the enabling technologies can be evaluated.\n\nThe approach builds upon, complements, and does not duplicate previous and ongoing investments conducted under the Joint Robotics Program Office. Work in this Project supports the Army Science and Technology Ground Maneuver Portfolio. Ground Maneuver Portfolio investments are greatly improving logistics throughput and surge capability supporting maneuver forces (Leader Follower technology) and allow experimentation with manned and unmanned teams to develop the advantages that inform\/protect the maneuver force (Robotic Wingman JCTD).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.

These technologies also provide innovative and effective Talent Management methods to optimize individual and team performance to ensure the Army can meet mission requirements in uncertain and complex environments. This PE evaluates new selection measures, assignment methods, and performance metrics for individuals and units; assesses innovative leader development and learning methods, and conducts scientific assessments to inform Human Capital policy and programs. Research in this PE will result in effective non-materiel solutions to help the Army adjust to changes in force size and structure, a variety of mission demands and contexts, challenges in human relations, and budgetary constraints.\n\nWork in this Project complements PE 0602785A (Personnel Performance & Training Technology)\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Science and Technology priority focus areas, the Army Strategy, the Army's Talent Management Strategy, and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork is performed by the United States Army Research Institute (ARI) for the Behavioral and Social Sciences in Fort Belvoir, VA."

All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas.\n\nThe Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Vaccine Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF) is the Department of Defense (DOD) only facility capable of producing good manufacturing practices (GMP) quality biologic products for use in early phase clinical trials. The mission of the WRAIR PBF is to support the development and licensure of vaccines and relevant biologics critical to the global health of our Warfighters serving domestically or abroad in compliance with United States FDA regulations. This project supports vaccine development efforts of strategic importance to the DoD, including Service medical research and development programs, those of other DoD organization such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and pandemic bio preparedness for emerging infectious disease threats in the Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nThe Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle, it will provide better protection to mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast caused by landmines or improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB.\n\nThe Deployed Warfighter Protection project, the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), plans to develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. The focus of this program is to develop new or improved systems for controlling insects that transmit malaria, dengue, chikungunya and other emerging infectious diseases under austere, remote, and combat conditions; understand the physiology of insecticidal activity to develop new compounds with greater specific activity and\/or higher user acceptability; examine existing area repellents for efficacy and develop new spatially effective repellent systems useful in military situations; develop new methods or formulations for treating cloth to prevent vector biting; and expand the number of active ingredients and formulations of public health pest pesticides, products and application technologies available for safe, and effective applications. The AFPMB partners with the President's Malaria Initiative and the World Health Organization Global Malaria Program to lead development of new tools for insect-borne disease prevention.\n\nThe Medical Operational Data System (MODS) deploys modernized data visualization capabilities to enhance Army Unit and Individual Medical Readiness Reporting. MODS provides Army leadership with a responsive and reliable human resource and readiness information management data system for all categories of military and civilian medical and support personnel. MODS provide Tri-Service support through applications such as Electronic Profile, Behavioral Health, and Medical Education.\n\nThe Pharmacovigilance Defense Application System (PVDAS) provides military providers Defense Patient Safety reports from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a drug's release to market. The program identifies, explores, and demonstrates key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers. \n\nThe Mobile HealthCare Environment (MHCE) is the capability of secure, bidirectional messaging and data exchange between patients, providers and clinics using any electronic device. The program identifies, explores, and demonstrates key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers.\n\nThe Civilian Authorized Salaries and Other Operational requirements provide funding for authorized civilian workforce performing medical research, development, acquisition management and oversight that support the medical research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) programs at the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, Maryland."

This PE matures Soldier weapons and enabling components \/ subsystems, demonstrates lethal weapons systems with potential to provide greater lethality, target acquisition, fire control, and range at a significantly reduced weight for optimized Soldier and Small Unit system performance. The major focus areas for Soldier Lethality Science and Technology are Soldier weapons and ammunition technologies, protection technologies, cognitive and physical performance measures, training in synthetic training environments, and mission support capabilities such as situational awareness sensors and displays, dismounted power and energy technologies, and Soldier and Small Unit sustainment capabilities. This technology diverse PE also matures and demonstrates sensor technologies that increase Warfighter situational understanding, survivability, and lethality by providing sensor capabilities to acquire and engage all targets and threats at longer ranges in complex environments and operational conditions (e.g. day\/night, obscured, smoke, adverse weather, and other degraded visual environments), and for advancing live training technologies that accurately replicate and realistically represent the effects of current and future weapons systems during force-on-force and force-on-target training. This PE matures and demonstrates effective technology in personal combat clothing, protective equipment such as personal armor, helmets, and eyewear, combat rations, shelters, logistical support items for aerial delivery of personnel and cargo, and energy systems to power current and emerging Soldier-born ISR, sensor, optical, and communication systems with the least weight and sustainment burden on the Soldiers and Small Combat Units. This PE matures and demonstrates technologies supporting the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE), a single, interconnected synthetic training system that will enable Army units and leaders to conduct realistic multi-echelon \/ multi-domain combined arms maneuver and mission command training, increasing proficiency through repetition. A specific research thrust area is applying systems-based practices to mature and demonstrate scientific and tailored knowledge of Soldiers' physical and cognitive architecture to facilitate rapid and efficient designs, assessments and trade-off analyses of technology insertions on the Soldier. Significant S&T investments are directed to improve the effectiveness of the technologies a Soldier utilizes while reducing the size and weight of the form factor of the equipment.\n\nWork in this PE complements PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology).\n\nAll FY21 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command."

These technologies will produce proof of concept systems that decrease the probability of detection and targeting by peer and near-peer adversaries, enabling freedom of movement of semi-independent and dispersed formations and increased protection of high-valued assets. Demonstrations conducted under this Project will support Science and Technology efforts in Soldier Lethality protection\/survivability Projects to provide disruptive Camouflage, Concealment and Deception technologies to the Operational Army, supporting expeditionary maneuver in the Multi-Domain Battle Environment to open and retain windows of advantage.\n\nWork in this Project supports key Army needs and leverages\/complements the technical research of several PEs to include PE 0602143 (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ BB4 (Dismounted Soldier Survivability Materials), AZ5 (Soldier Protection Technology - Vulnerability), BE1 (Support Technology to Mission Command), AZ9 (Soldier - Small Unit Detectability Technology); PE 0601102A (Defense Science Research); and PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology) BI2 (Sensor Protection Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This Project capitalizes on operational partnerships by providing Science and Engineering subject matter experts (SMEs) the ability to assist Commanders in course of action development for potential near term solutions and condition setting for mid\/far term science objectives. Provides Soldier assessments to optimize, improve performance, validate and integrate technologies and methodologies with users. Research focuses on the Warfighter as the capability and will rapidly iterate user driven solutions that maximize their tactical performance. This Project also matures and demonstrates Soldier centric technologies for the Soldier\/Squad Virtual Trainer (S\/SVT) to support the Army's Synthetic Training Environment (STE). The STE is the next generation holistic collective training capability that will train units where they will fight, with whom they will fight with, and in complex operational environments to include dense urban and sub-terrain; within the entire range of combined arms maneuver tasks in support of Multi-Domain Operations. The S\/SVT system combines and integrates several individual Soldier and Squad training capabilities, STE Squad Capability (SSC), Weapon Skill Development (WSD), Joint Fires Training (JFT), and Use of Force (UoF), into a single capability that can be conducted simultaneously or individually and enable physical movement\/exertion related to the execution of Soldier\/Marine individual and Squad collective training tasks. The STE will provide the realistic repetitions necessary to fight 25 bloodless battles before the first battle; a Secretary of Defense priority.  \n\nThis Project is fully coordinated with work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) as well as work conducted by Medical Research & Development Command (MRDC), Army Research Institute (ARI), U.S. Military Academy (USMA), and other academic and industry partners. This work is in partnership with Forces Command (FORSCOM) operational units and the appropriate Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) organizations as well as established transition partners, including Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) & Program Executive Offices.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

It validates and integrates human performance assessment methods and algorithms into training\/education, test and evaluation methodologies, and materiel solutions to compare performance impacts between different materiel and non-materiel solutions to maximize the individual Warfighter and small unit. These methods and algorithms have potential to enable the development of aspects of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF) improvements and efficiencies. This Project also uses Soldier assessments to iteratively improve the performance, optimize, and integrate technologies to augment Soldier function (e.g. shoot, move, perceive, decide, and communicate) during missions for maximizing performance. This Project supports the Measuring and Advancing Soldier Tactical Readiness and Effectiveness (MASTR-E) joint Science and Technology program supported by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Close Combat Lethality Task Force.\n\nThis work is directly supported by and fully coordinated across PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) and PE 0603118A (Soldier Lethality Advanced Technology) as well as work conducted by Medical Research & Development Command (MRDC), Army Research Institute (ARI), U.S. Military Academy (USMA), and other academic and industry partners. This work is in partnership with Forces Command (FORSCOM) operational units and the appropriate Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) organizations as well as established transition partners, including Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) & Program Executive Office- Soldier (PEO-S). This project also complements and is fully coordinated with work performed across Army, Navy, and Air Force under the Reliance 21 Human Systems Community of Interest: Systems Interfaces & Cognitive Processes and Protection, Sustainment, and Warfighter Performance.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Close Combat Lethality Task Force, the Army Modernization Strategy and supports the Soldier Lethality Cross Function Team (CFT) efforts.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

Efforts in this Project support early application of Human Systems Integration (HSI) during Advanced Technology Development by translating research findings into performance-based prototype subsystem, component, and software interface design criteria for use in the Army's requirements definition process and materiel acquisition process for Army Modernization. Application of this work will yield reduced workload, fewer errors, reduced task times, enhanced Soldier protection, user acceptance, and allow the Soldier to extract maximum performance from the equipment. Representative major efforts address Soldier cognitive load and cognitive fusion research, advanced aircraft design to include flight in degraded visual environments, and development of human performance measures and methods to address current and future human system integration challenges. Individual efforts exploit adaptive learning methods and strategies, applied methods to accelerate expertise development, integration of displays for ease of use and optimized situational awareness, and development of technical frameworks for crew automation integration in Command and Control Systems (C2). Efforts also support flight crew decision-aiding and autonomy, advanced crew station design for aircraft, full mission operations in degraded visual environments, and advanced manned-unmanned teaming concepts.\n\nResults of these efforts are transitioned to the Program Executive Offices (PEO), Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Human Systems Integration (HSI) Directorate (Army G1), and the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). This Project complements work done in PE 0602143A (Soldier Lethality Technology) \/ Project BC3 (Soldier Decision Making & Communications Performance Technology).\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States Army Futures Command (AFC)."

The High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) supports the requirements of the DoD's scientists and engineers in three major areas of effort: supercomputing resource centers, the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN), and software applications. DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) provide extensive capabilities and demonstrate new technologies that address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. Efforts of the DSRCs are augmented by dedicated HPC project investments (DHPIs) that address near real-time and real-time HPC requirements. All sites in the HPC Modernization Program are interconnected to one another, the user community, and major defense sites via the DREN, a research network which matures and demonstrates state-of-the-art computer network technologies. The Software Application effort optimizes and improves the performance of critical common DoD applications programs to run efficiently on advanced HPC systems, matures and demonstrates leading-edge computational technology from academic and commercial partners, and provides collaborative programming environments.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy."

Further, the system will modernize and optimize the operations within the supply nodes to improve accountability and throughput. The objective of AGR is to integrate new and emerging technologies into the Army's sustainment system to improve throughput, accountability, and safety and provide the Warfighter with the flexibility needed to meet future needs.\n\nThe work under this Project will transition to the Leader Follower Program of Record (PoR). The architecture and safety work under this Project also lays the groundwork for the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).\n\nThis Project matures and demonstrates simulation tools that predict autonomous vehicle performance. This Project matures and demonstrates a real-time simulator that provides the ability to design and assess ground vehicle autonomous behaviors in adverse environmental conditions, reducing the need for field testing. These simulation technologies can be integrated across Army vehicle platforms as required.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy. \n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center.\n\nWork is also coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology), and transitions to PE 0604017A (Robotics Development)."

Data collection will involve both simulation and live collection. Simulation will provide a baseline to correctly collect, clean, and analyze data that meets the need for improving algorithms for both formation control and unmanned aerial vehicle map input for unmanned ground vehicle mobility. Live data will start with Surrogate platforms in local areas. This will allow proper collection techniques, tools, and data to maximize embedded autonomy using Machine Learning and other Artificial Intelligent methods before utilizing live data collection. The Project will use AI\/ML techniques to mature and demonstrate intelligent formation control to be used on maintained roads and in complex terrain without the need for GPS. Data will be collected from mounted platforms utilizing special internal and external sensors to improve algorithms for exact positioning, undistributed formation control, and increased speeds of unmanned platforms. Also, the Project will use AI\/ML techniques to optimize intelligent autonomous ground platform planning through the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) mapped areas. Data collected from air vehicle will be converted to maneuverable information for unmanned ground platform with the identification of enemy positions, go\/no-go areas, terrain classification, and optimal suggested paths.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy .\n\nWork in this Project supports the Army Modernization Priority Next Generation Combat Vehicle.\n\nWork is performed by the United States (US) Army Futures Command.\n\nThis Project is coordinated with PE 0602145A (Next Generation Combat Vehicle Technology)."

Project K70 pursues technologies that provide our Warfighters with a Common Operating Picture (COP) to enable increased situational understanding and combat overmatch. Specific areas of maturation and demonstration include technologies that integrate disparate sensor architectures, perform multispectral aided target detection (AiTD), enable passive long range target identification (ID), improve day\/night visualization systems, allow rapid wire area search, and facilitate augmented reality. Project K86 matures and validates airborne platform sensors and algorithms designed to detect targets (vehicles and personnel) in camouflage, concealment, and deception. This Project provides pilotage and situational understanding imagery to multiple pilots\/crew members independently to enhanced operations in day\/night\/adverse weather conditions.\n\nWork in this PE is fully coordinated with efforts in PE 0602120A (Sensors and Electronic Survivability), PE 0602270A (Electronic Warfare Technology), PE 0602709A (Night Vision Technology), PE 0602712A (Countermine Systems), PE 0603001A (Warfighter Advanced Technology), PE 0602211A (Aviation Technology), PE 0603003A (Aviation Advanced Technology), PE 0603005A (Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology), PE 0603606A (Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology), PE 0603774A (Night Vision Systems Advanced Development) and PE 0604710A (Night Vision Systems Engineering Development).\n\nAll FY20 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe cited work is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas and the Army Modernization Strategy.\n\nWork in this Project is performed by the United States (U.S.) Army Futures Command (AFC)."

This Project will shape and protect Army investments in next generation fires by delivering proactive, scientifically sound risk and environmental impact management strategies. Efforts in this Project assess environmental factors in mission planning activities that impact the battlefield landscape of future threats while also identifying opportunities and impacts to mission success in sparse data environments. These efforts will enable mission planners to identify the industrial\/commercial resources used as components of weapons development. Technologies matured within this Project: inform the Army of potential environmental threats, opportunities, and mission impacts; help decision makers understand environmental threats in urban and industrial contested environments; and provide rapid sensing and assessment of the presence and extent of dangerous compounds in battlefield environments. \n\nA key aspect of this work is the enhancement of risk assessment and life cycle analysis techniques that can more accurately predict and identify the environmental liabilities associated with fielding new systems and technologies. Efforts also identify ways to economically comply with myriad federal, state, and host country regulations dealing with contaminated soil and water. This Project includes pilot-scale field studies to demonstrate technological feasibility and optimize performance and productivity of risk mitigation techniques.\n\nAll FY 2020 adjustments align program financial structure to Army Modernization Priorities in support of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nThe work cited is consistent with the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering priority focus areas, the Army Modernization Strategy, and supports the Army Strategy for the Environment. \n\nWork in this Project is performed by the Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi."

Project components, systems, system of systems, and decision aids enable ground vehicle mobility (freedom of movement), including force projection, and counter-mobility to impede movement of threat forces. Additional components, systems, system of systems for survivability support protection of personnel, facilities, and assets through design and reinforcement of structures, and for force protection to detect, assess, and defend against threats for troops and critical fixed and semi-fixed assets. Protection measures support force projection in areas such as air and sea ports of debarkation, dispersed small units, and units operating in complex and urban environments, which may include subterranean challenges. Work is in support of current and future ground force operations and future vertical lift. Software and architectures for geospatial projects mature and validate geospatial decision tools in support of operations planning and decision making to advance utility of geospatial capability and techniques across the Army, services, and coalition, and to advance and mature the information architecture that supports the total Army's discovery and access to data, geospatial information, and analytical tool suites. Methods to characterize and visualize behavior and population dynamics mature and validate efforts to portray the operational environment including culture, demographics, terrain, climate, and infrastructure, into geospatial frameworks. Force protection activities are focused on filling critical gaps in protecting forces operating in disbursed small units over complex and urban terrain and include maturation, integration, and demonstration of components, systems, and systems of systems for rapidly deployable threat detection in direct line-of-site and nonline-of-site environments; situation assessment to help reduce false alarms and decrease manpower required to monitor the environment; and passive protection to mitigate blast and weapon effects from advanced and emerging threats. Work in survivability and force protection also includes maturing and demonstrating software to characterize blast effects generated from explosive events, such as improvised explosive device detonation in soils, and supports design and decision aids. Force protection activities are also focused on protection of critical assets and infrastructure required to project forces into denied access areas. Work in mobility and force projection includes maturing and demonstrating software and hardware to assess and improve freedom of movement for ground forces, including autonomous ground resupply and manned-unmanned teaming and demonstrates infrastructure health monitoring assessment technologies to support emerging projection challenges in complex, contested environments such as distributed sustainment over large distances. Engineered Resilient Systems (ERS) activities focus on developing capabilities for \"upfront engineering\" that will result in more operationally efficient and resilient systems that are more affordable in a more rapid fashion. This effort develops and demonstrates an end-to-end thread involving analysis to inform requirements, reduce risk, and assess lifecycle cost pre-milestone A through tradespace analytics for selected systems of interest. \n\nThis work is being fully coordinated and is complementary to the ERS work described in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Element (PE) 0603832\/Project D8Z.\n\nThis work is fully coordinated with and complementary to PE 0602784A (Military Engineering Technology).

It will increase the utility of moving target indicator (MTI) radar to the greater multiple intelligence (multi-INT) picture for better origin-to-destination tracking, which is crucial to understanding the higher-level threat picture and increases the effectiveness and action-ability of battlespace awareness\/intelligence data throughout an area of operations.

The HD R&D program's low-cost and highly effective technology reduces the landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) \/ improvised explosive devise (IED) threat to deployed United States (US) forces and the local population. The HD R&D program coordinates with the Department of State's Weapons Removal and Abatement Program, the Department of Defense DoD Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and international mine action organizations and foreign militaries.   New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at annual Requirements Workshop and UXO\/IED Working Group Meetings.  Technology investments are prioritized using the results of these meetings and CCMD security cooperation and theater campaign plan HMA objectives.  The HD R&D program advances the state-of-the-art of demining technologies and evaluates these technologies utilizing host nation humanitarian demining partners.\n\nThe HD R&D program supports and bolsters the CCMD stability operations mission as directed under Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3000.05 to foster mil-to-mil engagement, and bolster economic security and development with partner nations worldwide.  Additionally, the HD R&D program fosters nations' mine action capacity while improving DoD's visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the US, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments. It also directly supports the National Defense Strategy through ensuring common domains remain open and free.\n\nThe HD R&D Program utilizes a research and development plan based on operational test data gained through Operational Field Evaluations (OFEs).  These OFEs provide the HD R&D program a unique capability to collect this data against live mines\/UXO in actual minefields around the world.  This data is unavailable to any other DoD organization. This OFE data drives future HD R&D program investment decisions and is shared and leveraged by the U.S. Army's Army Futures Command programs to further improve U.S. forces' technologies. In addition, the HD R&D program provides mine and UXO detector training to the CCMDs at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of Military to Military training and partnerships. Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 234 evaluations in 43 countries, including Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Colombia, Iraq, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Vietnam. The program's technologies have cleared 71.2 million square meters of the world's toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 213,220 mines and UXO.\n\nThe HD R&D program supports the DoD's strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with (DODI) 3000.05 (Stability Operations) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3207.01C (Department of Defense Support to Humanitarian Mine Action) to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nThis PE will be executed by the Army Futures Command (AFC).\n\nWork in this PE was previously conducted under DoD PE 0603920D8Z, Humanitarian Demining."

The HD R&D program's low-cost and highly effective technology reduces the landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) \/ improvised explosive devise (IED) threat to deployed United States (US) forces and the local population. The HD R&D program coordinates with the Department of State's Weapons Removal and Abatement Program, the Department of Defense DoD Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) programs of the Combatant Commands (CCMDs), and international mine action organizations and foreign militaries.   New technology requirements and areas of emphasis are identified and validated at annual Requirements Workshop and UXO\/IED Working Group Meetings.  Technology investments are prioritized using the results of these meetings and CCMD security cooperation and theater campaign plan HMA objectives.  The HD R&D program advances the state-of-the-art of demining technologies and evaluates these technologies utilizing host nation humanitarian demining partners.\n\nThe HD R&D program supports and bolsters the CCMD stability operations mission as directed under Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3000.05 to foster mil-to-mil engagement, and bolster economic security and development with partner nations worldwide.  Additionally, the HD R&D program fosters nations' mine action capacity while improving DoD's visibility and access, generating long-term positive perceptions of DoD and the US, and fostering collaborative relationships with host nation governments. It also directly supports the National Defense Strategy through ensuring common domains remain open and free.\n\nThe HD R&D Program utilizes a research and development plan based on operational test data gained through Operational Field Evaluations (OFEs).  These OFEs provide the HD R&D program a unique capability to collect this data against live mines\/UXO in actual minefields around the world.  This data is unavailable to any other DoD organization. This OFE data drives future HD R&D program investment decisions and is shared and leveraged by the U.S. Army's Army Futures Command programs to further improve U.S. forces' technologies. In addition, the HD R&D program provides mine and UXO detector training to the CCMDs at the Humanitarian Demining Training Center (HDTC) in support of Military to Military training and partnerships. Since 1995 the program has fielded technologies for 234 evaluations in 43 countries, including Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Colombia, Iraq, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Vietnam. The program's technologies have cleared 71.2 million square meters of the world's toughest minefields, and found or destroyed 213,220 mines and UXO.\n\nThe HD R&D program supports the DoD's strategic guidance to address instability and reduce the demand for significant US force commitments to stability operations; with (DODI) 3000.05 (Stability Operations) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3207.01C (Department of Defense Support to Humanitarian Mine Action) to reduce the social, economic and environmental impact of landmines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nThis PE will be executed by the Army Futures Command (AFC).\n\nWork in this PE was previously conducted under DoD PE 0603920D8Z, Humanitarian Demining."

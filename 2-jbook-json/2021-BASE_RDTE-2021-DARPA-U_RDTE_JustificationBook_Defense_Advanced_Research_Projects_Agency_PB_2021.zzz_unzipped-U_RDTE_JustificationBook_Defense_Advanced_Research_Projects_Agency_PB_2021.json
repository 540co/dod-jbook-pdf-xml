                        "val": "The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications.  It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences.\n\nThe Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives.  Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk.  This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation.  The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security.\n\nThe Cyber Sciences project supported long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security.  Information technologies enabled important new military capabilities and drove the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness.  Meanwhile, cyber threats grew in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk.  The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project produced breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.\n\nThe Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing.  In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions.  The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems.  Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.  Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas.\n\nThe Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems.\n\nThe Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing.  The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging\/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security.  Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery.  This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials)."

However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD.  Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.  The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges:  (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and\/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations.  This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and\/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and\/or gray zone mission outcomes."

This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with commonsense human cognition.  MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and commonsense knowledge repositories to support AI system development.  AI systems that are capable of more human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations."

GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results.  Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML-based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies.  Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation.  Techniques developed under the GARD program will address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments. GARD aims to develop new algorithms and theory for ML and AI that are robust to deception attacks."

Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits.  In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models.  The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design.  SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design, which will impact future DoD capabilities in areas such as chemical and biological defense, and warfighter readiness."

In supervised ML, a system learns through the use of labeled training examples to recognize and categorize attributes of images, text, or speech.  Humans provide these training-data examples to ML systems and with enough labeled data, it is generally possible to build useful models. Obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be costly.  LwLL is addressing this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation.  LwLL aims to create ML systems that are easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments, especially where training data is costly or sparse."

CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense and encode aspects of the physical world in a perceptual structure, and to use this structure to disambiguate language.  To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding.

To address these limitations the Foundational AI science thrust will focus on the development of new learning architectures that enhance AI systems' ability to handle uncertainty, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve robustness for DoD AI systems.  One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse and noisy data.  Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems as trusted human partners and collaborators.  A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated scientific discovery.  The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, and other DoD relevant applications."

Despite decades of rapid advancement in electronic computing, there remain important national security relevant challenge problems that do not lend themselves to achieving tractable solutions under size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained conditions.  For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources.  Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust, also in this PE\/Project, the goal of the Alternative Computing thrust is to develop novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to enable fast and accurate simulations for problems that are practically intractable using electronic computers.  Approaches considered under this thrust include the following: (1) analog computing substrates for efficiently simulating systems governed by complex non-linear phenomena; (2) multi-functional spin-based devices for scalable, efficient neuromorphic computing; (3) computing approaches that exploit the capacity of nonlinear systems to simulate nonlinear dynamical systems; and (4) quantum enabled optimization of complex systems."

Another expected benefit relates to human interaction, because the use of domain concepts provides a built-in framing for explanations to human partners. An additional expected benefit is the facilitation of more rapid learning processes including potentially transfer learning and one-shot learning. The APTAI program will make use of specific national security domains to drive assessment and transition of these initial concepts.

Formal methods are techniques for reasoning about and proving various properties for software code or design models, generally focusing on logical relationships that connect specifications and models with executable code. A key to scalability is to focus more narrowly on particular quality or functional attributes, such as security and safety, rather than address all features and functions of the components of a software system. A second key to scalability is to provide for composability, which enables trustworthy components to be efficiently assembled into trustworthy systems. The FMaS program will accelerate this new scalable formal methods paradigm by extending formal methods techniques, tools, and practices along several dimensions, including (1) the range of properties and qualities that are modeled and reasoned about, such as relating to security, safety, performance, fault tolerance, and real-time, (2) the complexity and the size of systems and their supply chains, including issues related to composability, (3) efficiency of formal methods-related modeling, tooling, and engineering practices, including more natural integration into mainstream tooling and practices, (4) ability to rapidly co-evolve systems and associated evidence, for example to respond to rapid evolution of threats and associated mission concepts, and (5) ease of use for non-expert developers and evaluators. FMaS aims to create formal methods applicable to software systems of the size and complexity commonly encountered in military and civilian mission-critical systems, and to speed the adoption of these methods into practice and tooling."

The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive.  Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect.  Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.  The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.  This restructuring is optimized to trade off execution fidelity and functionality for continuance of operation.  BRASS creates tools to automatically discover and monitor resource changes, build new analyses to infer deep resource-based specifications, and implement compiler and runtime transformations that can efficiently adapt to resource changes."

This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function.  Reducing the size, weight, and power of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals as well as enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials.  For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.  The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems."

For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal.  This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide.  Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF.  This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size.  AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system.  This new capability would enable a range of applications including wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.  Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels."

These sugar cube-sized microrobots will have integrated thermal, light, or audio sensors to assist with location of injured persons or critical infrastructure failures.  The capabilities of the developed microrobots will be tested through a series of specific tests at the end of the program.  The primary technical improvements needed for untethered mobility of centimeter-sized robotic platforms are in the efficiency, robustness, and force output of millimeter-scale actuators and in the power and energy capacity of batteries and chip-level power converters. Successful execution of the SHRIMP program will advance the micro-robotics field, allowing for practical robots to assist in disaster relief efforts in environments for which traditional robotics cannot efficiently operate due to their larger size.  A companion applied research effort is funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01."

PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare.  While PNT needs are usually met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential.  Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical\/navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term.  However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations."

Electrical bandgaps determine, among other things, a transistor's maximum operating voltage, current density, thermal resistance, frequency and color (wavelength) of light emission. Consequently, wide band gaps have considerable interest for the DoD due to the need for high operating temperatures, currents, voltages and frequencies often required by emerging high power, agile Radio Frequency (RF) sources for radar, communications, directed energy and electronic warfare. This program will overcome the fundamental materials and device challenges that currently prevent implementation of UWBG materials into power, RF, and optoelectronic devices and systems. These challenges include reliably manufacturing low-defect substrates, heteroepitaxial material growth, and high concentration p-type and\/or n-type doping."

These basic explorations include, novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.  Applied research for this program is funded within PE 0602716E, Project ELT-02."

As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization.  This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits and to incorporating privacy and security protections.  Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems.  The program will also explore architecture options for physically protecting sensitive information.

JUMP will therefore sponsor academic research teams focused on related key technology areas that will impact future DoD capabilities and national security.  The JUMP program will not only push fundamental technology research but also establish long-range microelectronic research themes with greater emphasis on end-application and systems-level computation.  By discovering the science underlying new technologies and overcoming engineering challenges, JUMP will enable DoD applications to exploit the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequency (RF) to terahertz (THz) and to employ both distributed and centralized computing with embedded intelligence and memory."

This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity.  Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks.  Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods.  Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic."

This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed.  The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue.  The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing.  Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process."

Efforts will draw upon computational modeling and experimental data to discover properties of biological systems that cross multiple scales of biological architecture and function, from the molecular and genetic level through cellular, tissue, organ, and whole organism levels. To enable in-theater, continuous monitoring, protection, and treatment of warfighters, this project will explore multiple diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including developing techniques to protect against emerging pathogens; exploring methods to slow damage from pathological infection or traumatic injury; and leveraging fundamental and engineered biological mechanisms to enhance tolerance to insults such as pain and altitude."

Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease thrust is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re-formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic."

Research efforts in this area applied recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness. One approach to achieve the program's goal was to identify the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults. Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species were combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival. By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, a survival blueprint is being developed to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection. This approach was orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention. Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens."

Successful battlefield medical and neural interface technologies developed within this Program Element address a broad range of DoD challenges to ensure warfighter readiness, including both resilience to infectious disease and neurotechnology for improved warfighter performance. To maintain warfighter health, battlefield medical technologies research in this project will investigate disease forecasting, detection, and therapeutic response. Example programs include a predictive platform for forecasting disease outbreak, identification of early infection biomarkers to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater, new methods to rapidly develop medical countermeasures in response to an emerging biothreat, and in-theater manufacturing capabilities for field-relevant pharmaceuticals to reduce the logistical burden and infrastructure requirements. To improve warfighter performance, this project will develop new neural architectures and data processing algorithms to interface the nervous system with multiple devices, enabling control of robotic prosthetic-limb technology.  Additionally, advanced evidence-based techniques will be developed to supplement warfighter healthcare, including the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and treatment of spinal cord injury."

One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies was the inability to obtain real-time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior. Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders. Efforts under this program examined the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determined how to best ameliorate these disorders. The objective for this program was to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices. These tools allowed for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and enabled new, disorder-specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel. Technologies developed under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression."

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  \n\nThe Cyber Security project is developing the computing, networking, and cyber security technologies required to protect DoD, U.S. government, and U.S. civilian information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical information systems.  Information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. industry.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators.  Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events.  Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act."

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems.  The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems.  Advances in these areas will allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations.  Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications."

We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity by, for example, recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems."

SC2 addressed the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access.  Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre-determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack.  First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized.  Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack.  SC2 addressed these challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time.  In particular, SC2 participants were challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies.  SC2 conducted two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years.  The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum."

At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers.  This brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing.  The Dispersed Computing program is developing a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources.  A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements.  These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks\/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data, given network conditions and available network-compute elements.  With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud, and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so."

The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering.  The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering.  CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber-physical systems.  CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber-physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries."

Current trends in mobile wireless technology development are unfavorable in that the U.S. is increasingly dependent on proprietary technologies offered by foreign suppliers. OPS-5G will develop standards-compliant software for 5G mobile wireless networks that is open source, programmable, and secure by design. The availability of open source software for 5G will have the additional benefit of opening the mobile wireless hardware market to new participants, stimulating innovation and competition. The OPS-5G program aims to move the mobile wireless market off its current model of opaque, proprietary, and vertically-integrated technology provided by a small number of dominant vendors to a more robust model of transparent, open source technology created by a diverse ecosystem of  academic and commercial software and hardware developers. OPS-5G will be coordinated with existing open-source 5G efforts and USG stakeholders."

These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will conscript poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.  XD3 will develop defensive architectures that use maneuver, deception, dispersion, and on-host adaptation to increase adversary work factors, boost resilience of mission critical services such as command and control, and ultimately thwart DDoS attacks."

Engineering organizations require large teams of engineers that collectively possess the necessary domain knowledge (of component technologies, theories, and tools), but the prolonged timelines of the development process for modern CPS hinders DoD's ability to counter emerging threats.  The Symbiotic Design program will address this challenge by transforming the human-focused, model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative discovery by humans and continuously-learning AI-based co-designers.  The program will create technologies essential for AI co-design, notably design space construction, design composition, and design space exploration.  The program will demonstrate the approach at realistic scales by a sequence of CPS design challenges of increasing complexity, and quantify the results with respect to development time, system performance, and innovation metrics."

As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance.  Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems.

AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions.  However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust.  Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system.  XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users.  XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems."

In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities.  If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies.  One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention.  Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and\/or unanticipated situations.  Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models.  AAI application areas include the following:  (1) machine-enabled techniques to efficiently capture, generate, and analyze disparate data sources to accelerate design and development of new materials and chemistries for DoD specific applications; (2) knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture, analyze and reason with expertise, experience, and data to prevent loss and increase value of critical national security knowledge\/expertise; and (3) social context informed AI approaches to enable reliable and robust forecasting and decision aiding tools for stabilization, deterrence and gray zone operations."

Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security.  The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators.

Natural language processing (NLP), a venerable sub-field of AI, has produced advanced but inexact capabilities for computers to process, translate, capture, transform, and utilize the information contained in the text and speech humans use for their everyday communications. Highly stylized language, for which standard NLP is dubitable, has been encountered in new language genres such as the language intrinsic to social media, for which style may be so heavy as to resemble a code. Importantly, stylized language in a constrained form is also characteristic of technical, legal, scientific, and other more formal sources encountered in specialized domains. Finally, the challenges that arise from language manifestations as influenced by culture, emotion, and media choice provide further motivation for language processing capabilities that exploit features of style. These cases challenge standard NLP but also offer opportunities for greater accuracy. The SLP program will develop language processing technologies for stylized language as it is used in specialized domains, new communication and social media, and by diverse cultures and populations. The techniques developed under the SLP program will be coordinated with DoD operators and applied to military application areas such as the engineering development of complex systems and intelligence analysis of foreign language information in cultural context."

Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise.  To address this, EAISI researchers will develop abstractions, patterns, architectures, assurance techniques, and iterative processes that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components and associated training data.  One of the more difficult engineering challenges with AI is evaluation and assurance, since AI-based systems tend to resist traditional approaches to testing, inspection, and analysis.  It is not possible to fully test an AI-based system for every situation it will ever encounter, so new techniques are needed for verifying and validating AI-based systems.  EAISI aims to create software and systems engineering techniques, tools, and practices to facilitate the development of AI-based systems that are capable, trustworthy, affordable, and timely."

Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets.

The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements.  Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications.\n\nThe Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations.  Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield.  The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. \n\nAeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical and aerospace systems and\/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements.  This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion, vehicle, and launch concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials and enabling technologies for aeronautic and aerospace system applications.\n\nThe Information Analytics Technology project develops technology for analyzing data and information arising from: 1) intelligence networks; 2) open, media, and other external sources; 3) sensors and signal\/image processors; and 4) collection platforms and weapon systems.  Technical challenges include the need to: 1) process huge volumes of diverse, incomplete, and uncertain data in tactically-relevant timeframes and 2) counter the information operations of sophisticated adversaries who seek to deceive, degrade, deny, and disrupt the U.S. information enterprise.  Benefits sought include deeper understanding of the evolving operational environment tailored to the needs of commanders at every echelon; an enhanced capability to plan, monitor, and control diverse military operations ranging from stabilization and information operations to combat engagements; and improvements to the efficiency of core military functions such as national and homeland security, warfighter health and readiness, and defense support of law enforcement and civil authorities."

Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long-range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target, kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs.  MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned.  MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new ship self-defense system."

These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention.

The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact.  Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior.  This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA is exploring scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent.  This mission requires the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments.  URSA is developing new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat.  It is implementing new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and building a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force."

The core objective of the SubT Challenge is to discover the solution(s) which best outperforms current approaches for manually and laboriously mapping and searching subterranean environments.  Newly developed capabilities will span across four technology focus areas in autonomy, perception, networking, and mobility technologies.  The program will increase the diversity, versatility, and robustness of relevant system technologies, capable of addressing the multi-faceted needs of a wide range of environments.  Innovations are being explored in the context of a public-facing, broadly inclusive DARPA Challenge."

The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research.  Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment.  The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties.  The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use."

Current approaches to identifying, engaging, and assessing effects against evasive ground targets in complex terrain requires significant human oversight combined with human semantic reasoning tied to rules of execution, resulting in slow and methodical engagements.  Proportional weapons will develop next generation effects for ground systems that provides extended range and tunable effects with greatly minimized impact to a warfighter operator.

This capability will enable long-duration pre-mission reconnaissance, extending the timeline of current human scouts by 5-10x, and will support continuous patrolling or tactical resupply during sustainment operations.  SCOUT is envisioned to host mission payloads that will integrate with other heterogeneous sensors, such as soldier-borne, vehicle-borne, weapon status indicators, and manned or unmanned ground\/air assets, to form a complete picture of an area of interest.  This will enable new, networked capabilities at the tactical level, such as automatic generation of reports populated with event, location, and status of forces, both manned and unmanned, to support response.  SCOUT developed systems will provide mobility and extended endurance to enable increased payload access and information to pro-actively stage forces, enable on-demand resupply, or rapidly call for fires in support of timely operations.

By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program is emphasizing low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter UAS missions and result in more affordable systems.  Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage.  The program is developing solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats.  The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability."

Key enabling technologies for the concept include smaller developmental payloads that benefit from multiple collaborating host platforms.  The Gremlins program will conduct risk reduction and development of the host platform launch and recovery capability and develop and demonstrate a recoverable Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) platform concept.  Enabling platform technologies will include precision relative navigation, advanced computational modeling, variable geometry stores, compact propulsion systems, and high speed digital flight control.  The program will leverage these technologies, perform analytic trade studies, conduct incremental development, and ultimately demonstrate the potential for an integrated air-launched Gremlins unmanned platform."

The program developed hardware and software to automate select aircrew functions and will employ novel, low impact approaches to interface with existing aircraft monitoring and control systems.  The program also developed tractable approaches to rapidly capture crew-station specific skills and aircraft unique behaviors.  To accomplish this, ALIAS leveraged recent advances in perception, manipulation, machine learning, reusable software architectures, autonomous systems architecture, and verification and validation.  ALIAS culminated in a demonstration of the ability to rapidly adapt a single system to multiple aircraft and execute simple missions.  This reliability enhancement capability enables new operational concepts for reuse of existing air assets and allows a reduction in the number of aircrew required."

Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets.  Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations.  ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers.  The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.  Technology developed under this program will be transitioned to the Services."

The military is turning to networked weapons and sensors onboard a heterogeneous mix of multi-purpose manned and unmanned systems.  In contested environments, it is a challenge for BM networks to communicate with subordinate platforms due to extensive adversarial cyber and electronic warfare operations, anti-satellite attacks, and the need for emissions control in the face of a formidable integrated air defense system.  The DBM program developed a distributed command architecture with decentralized control of mission-focused asset teams.  The architecture enabled rapid reaction to ephemeral engagement opportunities and maintained a reliable BM structure, despite limited communications and platform attrition in continuously evolving threat environments.  The program incorporated highly automated decision making capability while maintaining vital human-in-the-loop operator approval.  DBM technologies transitioned to the Air Force."

Approaches for addressing these limitations under the Multi-Scale Modeling thrust include the following:  (1) development of observation driven\/first-principles theory of magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling; (2) creation of an extensible assimilation framework for unifying space environment monitoring systems and data; and (3) non-traditional space environment measurement approaches.

In order to have more precise and on-demand control of microbiomes, technologies will be developed to elucidate the complex interactions between the microorganisms and their host as well as the interactions between consortia of adapted and evolved microorganisms.

These burdens increase if an increased level of protection is required. The Unburdening the Warfighter from CB Defense program will investigate and design novel biological and material approaches that provide rapid protection against multiple agents for the warfighter.

Living Foundries sought to develop the foundational technological infrastructure to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test-learn cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that could be engineered.  Ultimately, Living Foundries aimed to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value molecules.\n \nResearch thrusts focused on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. years) design and construction of new bio-production systems.  The result was an integrated, modular infrastructure across the areas of design, fabrication, debugging, analysis, optimization, and validation -- spanning the entire development life-cycle and enabled the ability to rapidly assess and improve designs.  Success was predicated on tight coupling of computational design, fabrication of systems, debugging using multiple characterization data types, analysis, and further development such that iterative design and experimentation would be accurate, efficient and controlled.  Demonstration platforms were challenged to build a variety of DoD-relevant, novel molecules with complex functionalities, such as synthesis of advanced, functional chemicals, materials precursors, and polymers (those tolerant of harsh environments)."

                        "val": "The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible.  The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter.\n\nAdvances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority.  The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures.  Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors.  Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware."

Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices.  These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems.  MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components.  These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems."

In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis.  Practical application, however, has been limited.  Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities.  The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources.  The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal.  This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.  In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and ultralow frequency communications."

Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems.  Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference.  DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs.  The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power."

Today's advanced wideband DoD systems, such as multi-function phased arrays, are open to all frequencies by design with little or no RF filtering.  This is due to a lack of tunable and reconfigurable filters that are small enough to integrate into the arrays, limiting the use of wideband multi-function arrays in contested environments.  The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important for implementing transmit\/receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays.  Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference.  Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to receive and perform signal intelligence functions while simultaneously transmitting a high-power jamming self-protect signal.  WARP will develop the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted jamming signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected.  Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self-induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP will develop intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers."

In addition, magnetometers offer the possibility of magnetic navigation, which may operate in GPS-denied environments. High sensitivity electrometers are used by industry to locate live current and static electricity sources.

HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements.  Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries.  However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance.  Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and sensitivity for radar and sensors.   Technology transfer efforts will follow a spiral development process to mitigate risk and provide the opportunity to incorporate new technological developments as they occur.

When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information.  The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments.  Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM will focus on two areas.  By 2022, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms.  By 2030, it aims to develop advanced inertial MEMS sensors that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.

These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle-mounted threat warning systems.  WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time.  Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available.  However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR\/MWIR bands.  WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR\/MWIR.  The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art."

However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled.  By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations.  ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments.

The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems.  Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP-C reductions at lower performance.  LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur.  These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets."

Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware."

Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors.  However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur.  This program is pursuing potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels.  Research areas include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, \"sticky logic\" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies.  Further research will support innovation in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs focused on DoD-relevant businesses.  The program is demonstrating the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.  Previous DARPA work on unconventional computing, integration, and reprogrammable memory give confidence in this approach.

Because of these limitations the amount of information gathered is quickly outstripping the human ability to review, process, fuse, and interpret.  To resolve this challenge, HIVE is leveraging improvements in computational efficiency to augment the analyst's ability to integrate large streams of data.  The program is investigating advances in chip architecture and data analytics algorithms that can allow machines to infer meaning out of data based on the information needs of the warfighter.

Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems.  Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap.  Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data.  To overcome these limitations, DRBE is leveraging advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems.  The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands.  DRBE is pursuing three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling.  The resulting test environment will allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test.  Multi-system exercises will then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE is serving to develop concept of operations (CONOPS), inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems."

Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture.  To address this challenge, SSITH is driving new research in electronics hardware security and exploiting current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification.  Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law.  The program is also investigating flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.  Finally, SSITH is mitigating the potential negative impact of new security protection architectures on system performance and power usage.  Once developed, SSITH capabilities will be applicable to both commercial and military electronic systems."

Programs will explore new architectural concepts that employ a mix of weapon technologies that achieve lethality through a combination of overwhelming performance and overwhelming numbers rather than through the use of singular and costly high value assets.  Studies conducted under this program element include examination and evaluation of emerging aerospace threats, technologies, concepts, use of autonomy to minimize risk, and applications for missiles, munitions, and vehicle systems."

The metrics associated with this objective include total range, time of flight, payload, accuracy, and impact velocity.  The program will address the system and technology issues required to enable development of a hypersonic boost glide system considering (1) vehicle concepts possessing the required aerodynamic and aero-thermal performance, controllability and robustness for a wide operational envelope, (2) the system attributes and subsystems required to be effective in relevant operational environments, and (3) approaches to reducing cost and improving affordability for both the demonstration system and future operational systems.

Large scale components of this complex propulsion system will be developed and demonstrated independently; to be followed by a full-scale freejet TBCC propulsion system mode transition ground test.  Accomplishing these objectives will enable future airfield-based hypersonic systems to operate without special logistics considerations, resulting in transformational changes in long range strike, high speed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) operations.  The anticipated transition partner for this effort is the Air Force."

Additional considerations include the need for compatible mobile ground launch platforms enabling integration with existing ground forces and infrastructure, and specific system attributes required for rapid deployment and redeployment.  The OpFires program will conduct a series of subsystem tests designed to evaluate component design and system compatibility, and culminate in integrated end-to-end flight tests.  OpFires will leverage and integrate ongoing investments in hypersonics to achieve these objectives.  The transition partner is the Army."

Technologies will be explored to allow increased levels of autonomy, improved operating ranges, improved mobility through complex 3-dimensional battlespaces, and integration of the requirements for both ground and air mobility in complex urban warfare settings.  Reduced manning requirements will be a part of the design space evaluation, with unmanned vehicles operating in a supporting role instead of a traditional supported role.  Novel approaches to multi-modal platforms, platform states, and manned-unmanned teaming that reduce the need for highly trained personnel dedicated to monitoring unmanned vehicles will be explored.  Problems that cross all domains, such as high energy density power supplies, navigation through uncertain and changing environments, and supervisory autonomy of vehicles will be addressed.  Novel networking and teaming approaches to achieve tactical tasks will also be explored to close the seams between ground and air unmanned vehicles and to improve confidence in identifying risks associated with both natural hazards and enemy actions prior to ground personnel entering an area.  Cueing from other assets and long range, long duration autonomous assets will be included in the overall tradespace explored."

LongShot will explore new engagement concepts for multi-modal, multi-kill systems that can engage more than one target.  LongShot can be deployed either externally from existing fighters or internally from existing bombers.  An air system using multi-modal propulsion could capitalize upon a slower speed, higher fuel-efficient air vehicle for ingress, while retaining highly energetic air-to-air missiles for endgame target engagements.  This approach provides several key benefits, which ultimately increase weapon effectiveness.  First, the weapon system will have a much-increased range over their legacy counterparts for transit to an engagement zone.  Second, launching air-to-air missiles closer to the adversary increases energy in terminal flight, reduces reaction time, and increases probability of kill.  The program will also evaluate other applications of multi-mode propulsion.  Potential transition partners include the Navy and Air Force."

Ground vehicles could perform traditional UAS missions such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and fires support, as well as unique missions such as electronic attack, sensor emplacement, infrastructure attack, and active protection without having to rely on brigade and theater level assets.  This effort explored design interfaces between the air and ground vehicle, attributes to allow for launch and recovery on the move, and design considerations to enable operations in contested environments."

This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced\/maintained.  Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities.  Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued.  In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space.\n\nSystems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users.  Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems.  Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution\/reconstitution of assets, and agility\/functionality not previously available for military systems."

There is a $5M cost goal to drive down the expense of space access by an order of magnitude versus traditional expendable launch vehicles.  This is accomplished by designing for high velocity staging which dramatically reduces the amount of costly expendable hardware.  The ability to fly 10 times in 10 days and designing the system to launch a payload into orbit within 24 hours traces to the responsiveness necessary in a military system.  The system will be designed to fly greater than Mach 6.5 multiple times, which directly translates to a reusable hypersonic capability.  The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force."

The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to provide robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability.  Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool\/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams.  The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer.  To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the consortium for execution of rendezvous and servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to develop and publish non-binding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches."

This technology will significantly lower the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) of high-resolution intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites enabling persistent coverage by an affordable satellite constellation and with a rapid reconstitution ability.  To achieve this goal, Planar Imager will exploit recent developments in materials science and nanofabrication by maturing small-scale ultra-thin optics demonstrated in the laboratory to meter-scale and demonstrate a proof-of-concept optical system in space.  The reduction in optical payload SWAP-C will disrupt the paradigm of costly custom large meter-scale aperture ISR satellites on dedicated launches to satellites with high-performance ISR systems that are ride-share compatible.  These compact optical payloads will enable a large number of meter-scale aperture ISR satellites packed into a single launch vehicle fairing, dramatically reducing launch costs as well.  A more persistent and pervasive space-based ISR architecture will increase warfighter readiness and lethality.  These planar optics will also have applications to any optical imaging system and will impact all areas of optical remote sensing and imaging as well as any system that requires optical components including laser systems.

For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today.  The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind infrastructure.  This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today.  Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space, which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs.  The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure.  To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge will reward competitors who can demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site.  The U.S. Government can make future use of commercial contracting mechanisms for rapid space launch with successful performers.  The anticipated transition partners are the Air Force and NASA."

Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements.\n\nThe Mixed Technology Integration project funds the advanced development and demonstration of selected basic and applied electronics research programs.  Examples of technologies with funded development and demonstration activities include, but are not limited to: (1) reducing the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of components for laser weapon systems that will protect airborne platforms from emerging surface-to-air missiles; (2) integrated photonic-electronic components for positioning, navigation and timing in GPS-denied environments; (3) flexible, software-defined cameras that enable real-time image analysis of complex scenes to provide more actionable information; and (4) optical communications systems that rely on no moving parts enabling their use on SWaP-restricted platforms.  Funding under this project is intended to advance transitioning novel technologies to use, providing advanced components compatible with mid-term and other future warfighting requirements.\n\nThe Beyond Scaling Advanced Technologies Project is a continuation of DARPA's basic and applied research in this area and will support activities in large scale co-development with leading industry players to enable and accelerate transformative computing interactions with industry. Funding under this project will include developing new technologies and capabilities in commercial settings, establishing access to these new processes and commercial state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundries, developing manufacturable processes for integrated photonics, new architectures and integration technologies for advanced field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and innovating back end of line technologies for wide bandgap semiconductors."

This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC.  Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates.  These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame.  Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements.  Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame.  The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs.  Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information.  The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band.  By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs will enable real-time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army."

These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable.  The program exploits recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies.  PRIGM is focusing on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions.  These advances will enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance.  PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical\/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems.  Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.

Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmable RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities.

It accomplishes complementary goals of working in a commercial environment for innovation beyond-SOTA to develop electronics for military capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening our domestic ecosystem and ensuring that the DoD has enduring access to SOTA technologies.  Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge silicon foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. This program will forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing design capabilities for advanced digital logic in SOTA foundries, developing new architectures for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using commercial manufacturing flows, and lowering the technical hurdles for ubiquitous heterogeneous integration by revolutionizing back end compound semiconductor processes. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services."

Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form-factor.  We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35.  One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile.  This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously.  This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages.  To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block.  The program will be executed in two primary technical areas.  First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems.  Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance compound semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system.  Technologies from this program are intended for transition through commercial industry to the Services."

Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal-scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input\/output (I\/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and FPGAs, widely used in advanced DoD sensors and RF systems. The goal of the program is improving I\/O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by >100x to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual-use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing.

The mixed-mode circuits take signals from the physical world (analog, RF) and transform them to be processed in computing systems (digital). As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies to carry faster data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitries with high speed digital processing logics onto one integrated chip is needed to attain the performance required for future systems. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G\/6G applications. The goal of T-MUSIC technology is to enable wireless operations beyond 100 GHz with very wide bandwidth with low noise and high dynamic range. In parallel, T-MUSIC aims to develop the next-generation terahertz (THz) mixed-mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on-shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed-mode System-on-Chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications."

The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating.  Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission.  There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network.  The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales.  Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability.  The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments.  The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services."

GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains.  By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities for DoD military mission planning and execution.

The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments.  Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost.

These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command.  The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries.  This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.  The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation.  PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).  The PFC program will transition to the Services."

The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate.  The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program was to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems.  The program leveraged technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint.  The approach included exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity.  The ultimate goal was to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.  Technology from this program transitioned to the Army."

The goal of this High-Capacity Links technologies program was to demonstrate a 100 Gigabit-per-second (Gb\/s) radio frequency (RF) backbone that could meet the anticipated mid-term (within 3-10 years) wireless networking capacity needs of deployed military forces.  The primary focus of the program was a millimeter-wave (mmW) solution to provide high capacity and all-weather resiliency.  The program developed the constituent subsystems (waveform generation, efficient power amplifiers, and receivers) and spatial multiplexing architectures to construct an all-weather mmW 100 Gb\/s backbone at half the SWaP consumption of the current Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA) system.  Technology developed under this program transitioned to the Air Force."

It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission.  The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system.\n\nThe objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations.  Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.\n\nThe Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept.  Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness.  Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants.  These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable.  Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning.  Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies.  Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required.  This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic\/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical\/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations."

Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities.  The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact.  In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems.  The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture.  These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration.  Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services."

The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification.  RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques.  During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent.  The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes.

Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems.  Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force.  The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces."

Ocean of Things will apply advanced analysis techniques to the stored data to synthesize and discover new signals and behaviors in the ocean environment. The program will research the spatio-temporal composability of sensors and develop applications for distributed platform behavior using an internet of things (IoT) architecture deployed across the world's oceans.  Further research will examine additional platform capabilities and system impacts of communication rate and edge processing.  The Ocean of Things program will improve ocean awareness and provide persistent coverage to areas between existing platforms.  Technologies developed in Ocean of Things will transition to the Navy."

The NOMARS program seeks to design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew.  NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the seaframe (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power.  The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that can operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance.  This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, which allows the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers.  A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low cost and low value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent."

Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, and marine fouling and corrosion.  The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state-of-the-art.  These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention.  This program also has a companion applied research effort budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-03.  The anticipated transition is to the Navy."

The Sea Train concept enables vessels that are efficient for transoceanic transport while enabling dispersed operations as individual vessels.  The Sea Train program will develop and demonstrate connector approaches to couple the vessels, the control laws required to drive the vessel in open ocean conditions, sensor approaches to understand the wave environment to efficiently navigate the vessel, and the autonomy required to connect and disconnect the vessels without human intervention.  The goal of this effort is to improve transport efficiency over what can be achieved with current monohull designs.

Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals.  At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk.  Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time.  The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations.  A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location.  By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position.  Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy."

The MOCCA program aimed to nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems.  The off-board UUV sonar projector was planned to operate under positive control at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program achieved breakthrough capability for novel low probability of intercept\/low probability of detection (LPI\/LPD) communication signaling.  The MOCCA communication system was integrated into submarine onboard sonar systems.  Communication technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy."

This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems.  Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair.  These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program sought to overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies.  The program developed and demonstrated novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes.  The program focused on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies.  The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program emphasized early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity.  Program technologies transitioned to the Navy."

For all of these applications, sensor gain had been achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays.  The TEAC program created the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit-cost sources that work cooperatively to focus energy undersea.

Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars.  This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats.\n\nThe Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets."

This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner.  This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems.  In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats."

Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects.  Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use.  Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms.  The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options.  This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation.  The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas.  Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security."

The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest\/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.  The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments."

This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner.  This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a System and Sensor Resource Manager (SSRM)).  This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions.  Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services."

Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects-chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains.  Building upon technologies from the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) program, budgeted in this PE\/Project, this program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide-area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors.  The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g. class-I or II unmanned aerial system).  The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains with possibly different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors.  Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies."

The tools produced by COMPASS will automate gray zone information operations and help U.S. forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and demonstrate tools to: 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments.

ATRs have typically been designed for specific sensors and provide only limited, static mission support due to pre-programmed target lists and operating modes.  Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets has been costly and time-consuming.  The objective of the ATR Technology program was to develop technologies that reduce operational limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life-cycle maintenance costs.  Breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms and embedded computing systems promised dramatic improvements in ATR utility.  The program focused on three core areas: (1) development of on-line adaptive algorithms that enabled performance-driven sensing and ATR utility; (2) algorithm training technology that enabled rapid incorporation of new targets; and (3) technologies that dramatically reduced required data rates, processing times, and the overall hardware and software demands of ATR systems.  ATR technology developed under the program transitioned to multiple agencies within the Department of Defense."
